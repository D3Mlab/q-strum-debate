            "I had a terrible time at this hotel, virtually in prison in a room with sealed windows, as my welcome to Canada. I was incarcerated here, with very average meals in paper bags, while quarantining - this despite the fact that I had had *two vaccinations* and a negative PCR test. I was charged $1050 for my one night's stay. (I was released from hotel quarantine after my second test result came back negative.) It is a disgrace that the hospitality industry seeks to profit from ordinary people's misery - the pandemic is bad enough already. The facilities were fine, and the staff friendly and capable. But why could they not find it within themselves to **refund** what I had paid for the other two nights. It is my hard-earned money, not yours! $1050 for one night in a sealed room and indifferent meals in paper bags = not OK",
            "Staying during mandatory hotel quarantine. Loved having a microwave and fridge available to me. All other amenities were good, bed, bathroom ect. Food quality was mediocre but plentiful.  Would have been nice to be given a choice between meals (the meat and vegetarian option for example)",
            "We like to stay close to YYZ for our flights and as we had an early morning flight this was perfect. We stay the night before our flight and this was the first time we stayed at this property. We booked on Expedia and paid $ 207.99 taxes in with our CAA membership. The property was clean and modern and was close to3 or 4 places to eat within walking distance and within the hotel itself. It had a pool and fitness centre and for those who like plane watching you can\\u2019t get any better. What stood out about this hotel was the customer service. From entering the property to checkout the staff was excellent. We will book this hotel again and would recommend it highly",
            "This was a nice, clean hotel. Close to the airport, with shuttle service. Our room was spacious and included a King sized bed, walk-in shower, mini fridge, and microwave. We were a bit worried about our quality of sleep, being so close to the airport but we slept very well and didn\\u2019t notice the noise of the planes taking off\\u002Flanding. Our only issue was that both elevators weren\\u2019t working when we came in after dinner. There are no indoor staircases, which was odd. A staff member brought us up to our floor, using the staff elevator, so it wasn\\u2019t a big deal. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for anyone needing a place to stay, close to the airport. I should also add that the front desk staff were very friendly and welcoming",
            "Stayed here for 2 nights unexpectedly because my flight home was delayed. Very happy I randomly chose this place - I wanted something budget friendly and didn\\u2019t need extra frills or anything. All the staff I spoke to were friendly and helpful, restaurant\\u2019s food was good, beds were comfy, room was clean. No complaints! I\\u2019d stay here again. The airport shuttle every 30 mins was very convenient too.",
            "This Best Western is a very well designed and appointed property. Our room was well appointed and the bathroom had a walk-in shower.\\nThe restaurant offered a great menu and the food was excellent.\\nExtended parking is also available. We will definately stay here agai",
            "Incredible, friendly service. Great food & bar. From the front desk to the bartender, we felt so welcome. The bed was very, very comfortable The entire decor and interior was upscale.This hotel was the finest Best Western we have ever stayed in",
            "This was a very nice hotel at a great location. Shuttle service was great to get you to and from the airport where you can catch the UP train to downtown Toronto. Front desk staff was great. Very friendly and helpful. The rooms aren\\u2019t overly big or fancy, but they were clean and the beds were comfortable. All you need at a great price. Would definitely stay there agai",
            "This was in a strange location without a car, really nothing around. The room was very nice in a very new hotel, very comfy. The pool area was ok with a nice small gym as well. One disappointment was no breakfast like we traditionally are used o at most best westerns",
            "The staff is pleasant and helpful at this location.  Shuttle driver is helpful with bags and safe drive.  The cost is a bit high, but location is convenient near the airport and parking available reasonabl",
            "In January\\u002F2024 stayed 1 night with parking for 2 weeks. As usual, it was an excellent stay. We have stayed at this hotel several times mostly in the past, but decided to stay prior to our trip in January\\u002F2024. I phoned the hotel this morning to make another reservation. I needed a room, 2 beds, parking for 2 weeks. The same package as we had in January. To my complete shock, the gentleman on the desk quoted me $420.+ tax.!!! When I asked why the price was so high, he responded with \\\"well, it's the time of year.  We need the room for the night of Dec. 19\\u002F2024, & we return Jan. 3\\u002F2025. Why are we expected to pay a higher price for the date needed, rather than what the rate is on the date of booking. In Jan. we paid approx. $340.00...this increase is not acceptable., & I'll be calling someone come Monday morning. If this is the way the Best Western operates, you can be sure we'll be staying elsewhere",
            "Excellent stopover going and coming from a trip.  Covered garage is a plus.  Front desk are so friendly, laid back and helpful.  Restaurant is simple, has great food and staff are also very friendly.  Rooms have been updated, are very clean and bed and pillows ate so comfortable.  Rooms have fridge, microwave and coffee maker.  We have been here before and will return again.  Join the Best Western Reward Club, get points to put towards a free stay but be sure to quote your rewards number when making your reservation.  FYI..your charge on credit card may be $50 more than your actisl bill but that is a hold charge that will be credited back to your card within a few days later.  I would suggest they tell you that up front so you understand that when your card is charged.\\nShuttle is prompt and courteous.\\n\\",
            "It was really nice to stay in a place that resembled the pictures they advertise on the Internet. I can\\u2019t say enough good things about my experience at this location. Highly recommend it! The staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home, the facilities are clean and inviting, and it was perfect location for myself and my husband to get to the airport and for my business meeting at the Congress centre",
            "Staff are always friendly and helpful.  Nice it is only a 10 minute ride on the shuttle to the airport.  The restaurant staff are friendly and kudos to the chef,  food always tastes wonderful!  We also love the covered parking for our vehicle",
            "The hotel was clean and comfy, staff very sweet and doing their best. If you are physically challenged in any way please call ahead to the hotel directly because you have to park in the parking garage on the 4th floor to get into the hotel from your paid parking spot, and there\\u2019s no way you\\u2019re getting a wheelchair in those doors, stairwell unless you can get out of your chair, lift your leg over large thresholds. It was difficult for persons walking with canes or a walker I'm sorry to say, including myself. Again, the hotel was clean, staff are friendly and helpful, good people.",
            "Hotel is close to Airport, morning staff were friendly.\\nRestaurant at this hotel had a good selection.\\nMeeting room was comfortable and nicely laid out.\\nCoffee in the lobby cost $2.00, and nice selection of snacks available at the front desk",
            "We recently took a trip out of Toronto and needed an park n fly hotel.  Our travel agent suggested the BW Premier Carlingview.  We had never used this hotel before but she said we should give it a try.\\n\\nThe hotel was very nice, quiet, had lots of amenities and a very good bar\\u002Frestaurant.  What we appreciated the most though was the covered parking.  Any one leaving on a winter vacation knows the value of coming home and not having to clean off your car while not dressed properly.  \\n\\nThe other major reason we loved this airport was the shuttle.  It is a 24 hour shuttle and it goes directly to the airport and does not stop to pick up others from additional hotels.  That is important when you have to be up at crazy hours and are in a hurry.  The price was very reasonable too so you really have no reason not to try BW Carlingview",
            "I have stayed at this hotel numerous times. It is immaculately clean, great service, & the restaurant on site provides delicious meals at reasonable prices. There's really no need to go off the property to eat. HOWEVER I recently called to get a quote for a room for 2 people, 1 night (park'n'fly package). The reservation I want is for December 23. Yes, that far in advance, as our vacation package has us booked for an outbound flight Dec. 24. I was advised by the woman on the desk that as of the time I called, the room was $X., which I thought to be very reasonable. HOWEVER, upon learning of the date I was wanting, I was quoted a ridiculously higher price. She said that they base the cost of the rooms on the number of guests at the time I want. \\nTo me, when I'm quoted a price today...then told it will be $ higher for when I want, you can be sure I'll stay elsewhere. The woman also suggested to me that I wait 'til the 1st week in October to see if the price quoted would be lower. At peak travel time during Christmas, nobody is going to wait that long to book a room. I therefore said \\\"no thank you, I'll go elsewhere\\\", which I have already booked. By the way, Best Western the \\\"elsewhere\\\" quoted me $150.00 +tax for a one night stay, & 1 week parking which is there park'n'fly package. I asked if the price would go up when the reservation was indeed needed & I was told that \\\"No, we quote you a price today, that's the price you get it for..it won't increase'.\\nNo thank you, Best Western. You've lost a loyal customer",
            "Love that the room I was in was lino instead of carpet. The Indian dish from the attached restaurant with the homemade chili sauce was excellent. The hallways above ground floor are a little scary because they are dark and the air system is loud. Mixed feelings about the pool and spa area . Enjoyed having it to myself ( you have to book ahead)  but do not use the wet spa. I turned it on and a LOUD high pitch buzzing came out of it and stayed on the ENTIRE 45 min I was there. Just use the dry spa. Much quieter and more enjoyable. The hot tub was tepid. The guy who drove the shuttle at 530 in the morning was super rude to me which I didn't understand as I was feeling happy and grateful. Oh well. I was even more happy and grateful after I was away from him so I'll call it a win. Overall I was really happy with the hotel even with some of the negatives. The people working the desk were all very friendly. I'd stay there again",
            "We had a need for an overnight stay in Toronto with our dog - and this hotel is pet friendly and near the vicinity of where we were going.  The room was fine - the floor a little sticky from disinfectant we assume- but ok.  We did need to pay a pet fee, but it was reasonable compared to some places.  Breakfast was not included but there is a Coffee Time nearby and also a Hooters offering some food options",
            "Stayed at the Best Western Premier for one night before an early morning flight at yyz. Booked \\nA room with 2 queen beds and the price was good for 3 people. Clean, fast and friendly service and close to YYZ. Tips when booking this hotel included close to Parknfly, close to Airzona bar and grill with good food at good prices and if you like plane spotting this hotel is for you. Overall the property is quiet, clean and the staff were excellent. Will be back",
            "Hotel personnel were very professional and friendly.  We had dinner at the restaurant and the food was exceptional.  I will be returning to this fine hotel.  The rooms were very cleaned.  We booked a park and fly package which was an excellent deal and we parked our car here for 21 days",
            "When travelling in or out of Pearson Airport, this hotel presents the best value for long term parking. Most spots are covered for winter snowfall protection. Unfortunately, we got there late in the evening and had to park outside. That's on us, not the hotel",
            "This lovely hotel is close to the airport and has everything you need to make your stay and enjoyable one. The rooms a clean and spacious. The Staff are kind and helpful. The Flight Path restaurant serves delicious meals from incredible servers. The pool and fitness areas a clean and have great hours. There's covered (paid) parking (great for Canadian winters) and a shuttle to the airport (free) should you need it. Great stay - we highly recommend it...plus, the price was just right!.",
            "I stayed in room 319, and while the decor was a tiny bit dated, the bed was very comfortable, the black-out curtains were amazing, and the staff and restaurant really made this stay very enjoyable.  I appreciated the fact that the lady at the desk helped me with my luggage, given that i use a mobility aid, and had been struggling a little bit.  Oh, and the room i was in was an accessible one, with the roll-in shower, and accessibility bars, etc.  I was right around the corner from the vending machine, so that was a great perk as well.  The room appeared to be relatively soundproof, and I barely heard the planes, so my sleep was quite restful",
            "I stayed here for business travel during COVID-19, during an extended overnight flight layover and it did the job. The hotel was clean, check-in was quick and it's less than a 5 minute \\u00DCber ride from Terminal 3. My room faced the airport which meant I could hear the low rumble of aircraft taking off during the night but it wasn't that bad that it bothered me.\\n\\nThere are two things I base a hotel recommendation on; a comfortable bed and a nice shower with excellent water pressure, and this hotel had both of those. The TV was also wall mounted and larger than most hotel room TV's, which I appreciated. The coffee maker used the pod system, so if you are staying here for an extended period, you could use your own pods or a refillable one. The coffee was quite good, but I can't remember the brand they use.\\n\\nDue to COVID, all their other services and ammenities like the free breakfast and the gym, were closed, so I'm unable to comment on any of those. I would stay here again without hesitation",
            "Why is someone vacuuming right outside my door at 9:30pm? lol This hotel isn't bad. I didn't eat there, but there's a restaurant (looks kind of boring) called The Flight Path. That makes sense because this hotel is right under the flight path to the Toronto airport. So every 5 minutes a very loud plane goes by and sounds like it may land on me. I read other reviews before booking here that said it was so quiet and they couldn't hear a thing, but not my room haha. It could be worse though, could be trains instead of planes I guess. All in all, I'm happy. I feel comfortable. Staff is nice, room is clean. Pool and area is lackluster. There's a free shuttle that takes you directly to the airport, so we'll see how that goes in the morning :",
            "Prior to making my reservation I called the hotel to enquire about a late check out. I was told to ask upon check in. Which I did, which was promptly refused. I had booked the hotel specifically for this reason, having a late flight the next day, so I was not happy at all.\\n\\nThe room was fine, although I question the need to make guests pay for using the safe.\\n\\nThe shower needs looking at, the spray goes all over the place. An easy fix, but obviously overlooked by housekeeping.\\n\\nThere is no power outlet next to the bed, to the extend that the alarm provided by the hotel is not plugged in.\\n\\nUpon check-out (at 12, since I could have the late check out) I was charged for parking. While I understand this to be normal practice, I feel guests should be made aware - on the website as well as during check in.\\n\\nI was able to leave my bags at the hotel (no charge this time), I appreciate this.\\nOverall, the staff was friendly",
            "We have stayed here 3 times in 2020. We stay here every year as you can get your room, 1 to 2 weeks covered parking while you are away. They have a shuttle that takes you to and from the airport. They also have a restaurant on site which is only average but you can park your car, check in to your room and then go down with out having to go outside and eat. Makes every thing so much simply",
            "Staff were rude, beds were definitely a double not a queen, everything in the hotel was overpriced, water pressure in the shower was horrible, plug ins didn\\u2019t work in the room, noisey and could hear the people in the next room clear as day laughing and talking all night which made it hard for the kid to fall asleep! Hottub was barely hot, steam and sauna room was old and out dated and loud when turned on and not hot or steamy at all either. Parking was expensive as well.",
            "I was pleasantly surprised to find this hotel, located right across from a park N fly ..... newly renovated.  The rooms very very large and clean and decorated comfortably.\\nService at the front desk was friendly .... quick easy shuttle to the airport. \\nWill always use this hotel when flying out of Toronto international airport",
            "Our new spot to park, stay and fly in the Toronto airport area.  Friendly check-in. \\nRooms clean, reasonable size, quiet for the area.  Location close to airport and easy to get to.  There is a restaurant on site, also on site covered parking (i.e. ramps) with access to hotel.  Shuttle service totally fine.  \\n\\nThis was our first stay (of two nights - going and returning) but will not be our last",
            "This hotel is not the most chic but it is very clean and mere minutes from the airport. I live two hours from the airport and loathe the idea of delving into airport traffic. Travelling is hectic enough! This hotel offers a one night stay rate with $10\\u002Fday parking for your trip and a free shuttle that keeps you out of the airport melee. It is really a great solution and the staff are helpful, solicitous and courteous",
            "No shuttle service after 2 am +++inconvenient we had to pay for a cab for 40$ to get back to the hotel when it\\u2019s 5 min away.  The rooms are outdated, and we had to pay extra for parking. Overpriced for nothing. I will not recommend it.  Location is excellent, but no shuttle!!!",
            "Room was very clean and price was reasonable. On site long term parking was also reasonable. Shuttle service to the airport was on-time. On-site restaurant served good food at a good price and service was excellent. We would book this hotel again for a future stay when flying out of Pearson.",
            "The front desk check in, cleanliness, location, sleep quality and quality of the room were excellent as expected from Best Western brand. Where it differed was in value. Price per night was at high end compared to other hotels and offered far less amenities. \\n\\nNote that every Best Western is independently owned and operated. This particular location does not offer any continental breakfast and charges $3 for a very small cup of coffee in the lobby. There is limited parking and no outdoor parking if you have a larger vehicle. We chose this location for the Stay, Park & Fly package but they could not accommodate our vehicle.\\n\\nTatiana the front desk person was able to quickly locate an alternative parking for us to try at the regular Airport Park & Fly lot and arranged for us to get a shuttle back to the hotel via the airport once we parked there.\\n\\nIt did not appear that the gym or pool were available either but even if they were by the time we got the parking sorted out it was quite late and we had to be awake at 5 a.m. the next morning.\\n\\nIf you don't have a larger vehicle and don't need any amenities this is a great place to stay. Only because the price we paid for the night was high and the amenities low I am rating VALUE as low on this chart. Otherwise the room was extremely clean and comfortable and staff very helpful and friendly",
            "Nice hotel. Stayed here for 1 night after arriving at midnight form a flight. Just 7 min away from the airport. There is a shuttle service running every 30 min during the morning and every 1 hour during the evening. I believe that they should maintain a 30 min frequency all day long, as I had an evening flight and had to wait almost an hour for the next van to leave. Rooms are big and wifi service is quite fast. My room was clean as well as all the hotel common areas",
            "Called hotel one week prior to be told on telephone that I could book a one night stay and pay the $12 nightly parking fee to leave my car at the hotel for duration of my 7 day trip.\\nOn checking in I was then told this was not possible and also told by the manager on the telephone that no one at the hotel would have told me it was \\u2026\\u2026. i.e. I was not being truthful.\\nAwful treatment of a loyal customer",
            "Needed location near airport for early flight with free shuttle to same. Best Western is a reasonably priced brand I know I can trust.  I was very impressed with modern d\\u00E9cor of  room and bathroom  AND individual shampoo\\u002Fconditioner- so hard to find these days.  They really got it right with a shower cap and make-up remover towelette.  Bed was extremely comfortable.   The room and bathroom were  sparkling clean.  Keurig coffee machine was a nice touch.  Definitely recommend this hotel. Due to covid didn't use pool\\u002Ftub.",
            "Very clean room, excellent service in restaurant.  Covered Parking. Great for against the elements. One of the closest to the airport for a park, fly, stay scenario. You can stay either at the beginning or end of your trip. Shuttle to the airport is included",
            "I like this location because it is close ( 1 block)  to an Enterprise car rental that is outside the airport. That way I can save hundreds on picking up a rental car. I fly in to Toronto , take the hotel shuttle over and then walk up to the Enterpise. If you arrive late there are 2 restaurants 2-3 blocks from the hotel, that are open til after 12am",
            "This is a great place to stay when you need to be near Pearson. I booked mainly for the free airport shuttle (takes 5 minutes to get to the terminal) and the economical room rate. I was happy with the room - nicely updated with a really comfy bed and great walk-in shower. Restaurant was closed for supper but there are options just down the street. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the restaurant was fast, tasty and not overpriced. This hotel does what it's supposed to do, and does it well.",
            "We stayed here so I could drop my wife off at the airport. Literally a five minute drive. Room was great. Restaurant was cozy and had great service, great food and good value. Parking is limited and you have to pay extra for it.",
            "Looking for a good price in Toronto for a 10 night stay was a stressful nightmare, but i managed to get a decent price at Best Western. Considering the price I paid, I wasnt really sure what to expect for a room. Yet when i checked in, I was greeted with a nice, big king sized room, fridge and microwave which was helpful for my long stay. The bathroom was alrger than what i expect from hotel bathrooms, ans the open half glass wall shower made showering breathable (as someone who overheats easily). The internet was surprisingly fast and all of the staff I saw during my stay was amazing. I ordered from the restaurant once, and the server on that night was just as friendly and helpful. \\n\\nI have never had such a good stay in a hotel before. Thank you thank you thank you for such a wonderful stay! I look forward to my next trip to Toronto. I'll be looking to book here first",
            "The check in was efficient. Had to fill out a small form re the parked car. I was only in the room a scant 12 hours. Its colours are eclectic. My room overlooked the entrance area, catching the evening sun. The room temperature was set at a very pleasant 70F\\u002F21C. Had a large bed. It was, however, a poor sleep. Duvets and I just do not get along. Never tried the television. There was a closet which held a small safe, iron and ironing board. I did not use the microwave. The coffee maker was simple to use but the coffee itself rather weak. A little fridge could be found beneath the microwave. There were two comfortable chairs, one traditional, the other on wheels. Almost had to go downstairs re the wifi but it eventually connected and was fine thereafter. An ice bucket is another nice touch. The property is just five minutes from the airport. You pay a bit more for location [just over $212 Cdn included a parking fee]. It seemed rather busy but the floor was quiet. The bathroom was clean. I liked having actual toiletries. The shower was good. There were plenty of towels and a hair dryer. All in all, it is a nice property but I was not well rested before the flight",
            "I love this hotel. Perfect rooms, prefect parking. Everything is amazing when you stay in this hotel close to Pearson airport. They offer 15 days parking package for traveling. Rooms are well decorated, modern and clean. Breakfast and amenities better than any other hotel in the area.",
            "We booked here again, along with a friend because of the free parking and shuttle to the airport.  In addition, the rooms are clean, and they have a nice little restaurant on site.\\n\\nGood service, pleasant staff, and easy to get to.\\n\\nOh... and one of the most comfortable beds we\\u2019ve ever slept in",
            "Stayed here recently and my review is mixed.\\nThe room is clean and bright and overhead air traffic is not a problem. Front desk staff are friendly and helpful.\\nDisappointed in the parking availability. Definitely not something you can bet on. Internet and tv were down for the majority of the time is a major disruption when you\\u2019re travelling for business and need to connect. The restaurant is handy but overall you\\u2019d be better off elsewhere.\\nDon\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll choose this property again",
            "The staff are lovely at the hotel and extremely helpful.  The room was clean and basic. It is right on a flight path, but the noise is not noticeable at night. \\nParking is covered so problematic if you drive a larger vehicle such as a pick-up truck. No other options nearby to park. \\nThe restaurant is good and their staff helpful but has limited choices. This makes it difficult for those who have food restrictions. \\nThe Internet is slow, and TV is a little baffling regarding figuring out channels but that could be me not figuring it out properly. \\nIt is a pleasant hotel with courteous staff. Very responsive to communications as well.",
            "Clean, modern and welcoming hotel; great stay, park and fly packages.  Free shuttle to and from airport.  Covered parking lot!  No snow to shovel off when arriving home from winter break. Fabulous amenities. Staff is excellent and very welcoming."

            "This place is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  They gave me... a single woman staying alone a room that does not lock from either the door or deadbolt to the outside hallway. I had someone come open and walk into my room at 5 and even with the staff knowing they do nothing to fix or help the situation.  When I spoke to the girl in the front desk in the morning since the overnight man was a useless POS she said oh maybe it was him as if having some random man walk into a womans room is normal?!?  Ps it was not him. After asking and asking to speak with a manager and being told no countless times, then the manager was on his way then he wasnt, then he was again but in 2-3 hours. then again you guessed it he wasnt coming. and although all I wanted was to speak with him and he called a good 10 times while I was at the desk she would not pass the phone. finally they said they would comp a new room for the night and like everything else within 5 minutes everything changed again, this time they changed their mind and told me I have to leave without them taking any responsibility or making any other accommodation.  The customer service is TERRIBLE the man over night is SO rude screams and hangs up calls, the manager is completely non existant coward and the girls are just useless.  The only friendly person they had on staff was the room cleaner. If you take your safety seriously stay FAR AWAY FROM THIS NIGHTMARE!!",

            "My boyfriend and I checked in and asked for a non smoking room, when we walked in we could smell stale smoke in the air, we ignored it and turned on fan and opened door for a few mins. After we were there a few hours I started finding what I think are ants in the bed, I could feel them biting me on my stomach, I had also brought our 4 year old daughter to spend the night with us. She seen the bugs and started freaking she wanted to go home, I called the front desk to ask for another room and the manager said he had no rooms, mind you it was 6pm on a Monday so I'm sure the place was pretty empty, he told me that he would come and spray the room but we had to leave for 15 mins. Wtf!!! I couldn't believe that, he sai they have no problems at all here and maybe the bugs came from the cleaning lady's leaving the door open. He would not switch our room, I will never come to this place again and would recommend that anyone else come here either. I even took pictures of the ants to show him and nothing was done about this. I am so disgusted I will never ever come back here, it's a rip off. I might aswell took 70$ and thrown it in the garbage and slept out in te forest for the night",
            "I liked the price and the area was convenient for us. My girl friend didn't really like the place at first. She said, she felt the neighbourhood was \\\"sketchy\\\". Was walking around the room uncomfortably in her high heels, tight short black skirt, stockings, a tight shirt, costume jewelry, and long blond hair. Kept saying this is a \\\"hooker hotel,\\\" the irony of her words not lost on me. But she settled in and we had an good time. The hotel was quiet and clean, and after her initial discomfort, it turned out fine. We'll probably stay there again. (btw I didn't think it looked like a hooker hotel)",
            "La chambre \\u00E9tait propre, nous avons bien dormi.

            "We stayed here as two couples - we had rooms 101 and 104 - room 101 was the first room near the Queensway - which made it noisy. The room had individual heating and cooling - which was noisy so you had the option of noisy heating\\u002Fcooling or opening the window and road noise.\\n\\nThe room we had had a TV , fridge, microwave, phone, toiletries in the bathroom.  There was no tea or coffee making facilities.  There was no guest laundry at this hotel.\\n\\nThere was no breakfast available at this hotel\\n\\nThe beds were reasonably comfortable and the bathroom had a step in bath for the shower.\\nWhile we stayed there the hotel was FULL - with Via Rail track workers on secondment to a job in the Toronto area - they were very friendly \\n\\nThis is an average hotel with nothing special about i",
            "The room was ok, the washroom too.  Everything was clean. But the breakfast's area is very small everybody is crashing with you, it's very uncomfortable to have a nice breakfast if everybody is hitting you. Hopefully this review helps the staff to improve that part, your hotel is amazing!",
            "Flight from Toronto to Minneapolis was canceled, rescheduled for the next day. Normally airline would have hotel rooms on standby but a convention in Toronto caused room shortage. This room at Deluxe Inn with two Q beds was available for $117 CAD including tax. Our party of four adults arrived about 23:00, stayed until 6:45 the next day. Air very stale in this N\\u002FS room and smelled like scented spray, but did not smell of cigarette. Air conditioner worked and helped with staleness but very loud. Silverfish and spiders in bathroom and mold\\u002Fmildew on bathroom ceiling. Water ran very slowly out the tub drain and pooled around ankles while showering. Entire room didn't feel very clean or well appointed. Sheets on bed came untucked easily exposing mattress pads, but we did get about 4 hours sleep. Beds reasonably comfortable. Entered the room through a door from the outside like a motel. It appeared there may be permanent residents living in hotel who entered through a small vestibule with stairs leading up from the inside 'lobby' area which was separated from the 'front desk' by a locked sliding barred wall that the front desk person slid back when we received our key. This person was cordial enough but not overly friendly or welcoming. The barred wall was retracted in the morning when we returned the key, so perhaps it is for night-time security. All in all, would never have chosen to stay here but it was better than sleeping in the airport terminal and we were glad to have it",
            "I booked two nights at this hotel, as it was recommended as a temporary option by Humber College. After the first night I did not know who to complain to, either the College for actually recommending such a bad hotel, or to the staff for having the dirtiest place I have ever been. The place smelled bad, the toilet had feces leftovers due to poor cleaning and the carpet was terribly dirty. Definitively a place you want to avoid by all means. Although the location is quite good due to its location It would have been way better to both stay at a further and\\u002For more expensive place. Fortunately I was able to find a place to stay fast enough to avoid staying at this place one more night",
            "We stayed for one night, while we were in town for a concert at Budweiser Stage. For $95, it was a good deal. They didn\\u2019t charge us extra for the third person to stay in the room, but we still needed to get to the show.\\n\\nAt first glance, the hotel-room floors looked clean, but after walking around in bare feet for 15 minutes, our feet were filthy black, and when we went to wash them in the shower , they only provided one, little piece of soap for all to use.\\n\\nThe room was fairly tidy, smelled fresh, and provided a fridge and microwave oven.\\n\\nThe Hotel was a 12km\\u002F$20 Uber ride to the show, but after the show, the Uber rates doubled.\\n\\nAll in all, for $95, it was good value for the price.\\n\\",
            "Reasonably priced for the area. Fairly close to restaurants and shopping. The building is dated and has a musky smell. My room was clean. For the price that it is, don\\u2019t expect Caesar\\u2019s Palace. The only downfall was that the girl at the desk was a bit rude and sarcastic.",
            "This is a no frills motel. Don't expect bells and whistles because it's called Deluxe. Even though you request a non smoking room, if the person in the next room smokes and leaves their door open, you need to put a towel at the base of your door so the smoke doesn't enter. Only other issue is checking in sometimes long due to \\\"Ben\\\" not knowing what he's doing. Very incompetent and shouldn't be at the front desk as it reflects poorly on the motel. Best to deal with Ursula and the other girl with the British accent. I've stayed at this motel several times. Though it needs an upgrading, it's decent for the price. Staff are friendly",
            "Confortable pour dormir, la chambre est propre er le lit est confortable, la salle de bain fonctionne bien, peu cher pour une nuit ou deux, tout pr\\u00E8s des restaurants, des services et des grandes art\\u00E8res et autoroutes",
            "I have travelelled more than the average person so I think I am quailfied to say that this is a great Inn for the money in Toronto. We have never encountered bugs of any sort. Our room is always clean and comfortable on the main floor. The room is a bit on the small side but honestly the beds were way more comfortable than the Airport Travelodge or the Punta Cana Princess in the Dominican Republic. The room is equipped with and air conditioner, microwave and fridge ( even freakin duvets1). The Inn is convienient to the hospital. We thought of trying another \\\"budget\\\" hotel on The Queensway but slid by when after we pulled in and took a gander at the sqaulid offerings. Honestly, this place is a real bang for your buck in Toronto on a budget. Close to Tim Hortons (across the road!) With stores, restraunts, fast food and buses just outside the door. I am having surgery at St. Joesphs Health center and will have to be in Toronto for a few days. I would not think of booking any place else. I never saw a bug or a germ or mold of any kind. The rooms may smel a bit musty at first but turn on the air or the heat which is more than sfficient and the odor will go away. The room may have been cosed up for a few days. We will be back and soon. Thank-you for giving us an affordable option while in Toronto Deluxe Inn!!",
            "Booked this last minute as I needed somewhere to stay for the night.\\nI was told not to open the door if anyone knocks (okay that kinda freaked me out). About four time during my stay I would hear someone try to get into the room (maybe wrong door). I don\\u2019t know. But still when this happens at 3 am kinda freaky.\\n\\nOverall the bed was very comfy, good water pressure. The room was clean. Had a mini fridge and microwave in the room.  \\n\\nI was in a smoking room so of course the room smelt like smoke. \\n\\nWould I stay here again, no",
            "Nous avions une chambre style motel (la 109). Elle sentait le renferm\\u00E9 et la cigarette. Tr\\u00E8s sombre avec un tapis collant. Les draps \\u00E9taient humides. La salle de bain n\\u2019\\u00E9tait pas propre (surtout la toilette avec des poils et de l\\u2019urine sous le couvercle). Il y a m\\u00EAme eu un probl\\u00E8me de tuyaux qui semblait leur \\u00EAtre familier : le contenu de la toilette qui remonte dans le bain.... Le frigo et le micro-ondes sont pratiques ainsi que le stationnement. La route se fait bien pour aller au centre-ville, environ 30 minutes. Notre point positif de cette chambre : elle nous a oblig\\u00E9 \\u00E0 sortir et de faire de belles d\\u00E9couvertes",
            "Rooms may not be luxurious, but they are simple, reasonably sized, and clean.  Ursula and Mahesh in the front office were incredibly courteous and helpful.  The value was great since I needed to be in Toronto for almost two weeks.  I would happily stay again",
            "We stayed at this hotel because hotels downtown were either full or extremely expensive. The problem about this accommodation is that you will probably find yourself stuck in a traffic jam whenever you want to reach downtown. The room was fine, don't expect any luxuries. Staff at the front desk was a bit rude",
            "Let me start off by saying I was a store manager for a fortune 500 company in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania.  My complaint and experience is this, had stayed here total of 3 separate weeks. First week was great accommodations for the room are fair, second week toilet had non matching nor fitting tank lid, sink stopper non working, internet randomly stops working at odd times.  Most of all went down to reception on Saturday the 26th and spoke with front desk personal.  Extended our stay till thursday the 31st as when my husband is flying back to the UK.  I was very clear as check out on the 31st as again that was the day of his flight.  This morning on the Wednesday October 30th were rung by front desk stating the room wasnt paid for the 30th to 31st.  Went down there and talked to front desk personal and the Manager\\u002Fowner was also present. They then proceeded to state that the room wasnt paid for, then we explained that had extended till the 31st as thats the day he is flying out.  Went into a slightly heated debate over this.  As being in customer service, they need to understand within reason that the customer is always right.  Why would I book till the 30th to have to move to another hotel for one night!  The oddassity to call me a liar to my face as a paying customer is very repulsive. The room is decent but if you want to be treated as a human being I would steer clear of this establisment.  He needs to go back to business school to learn how to run a business and apparently some manners would be nice as well. On top of all of this their rate changes from weekdays (87CAD) to weekends(95) as all hotels\\u002Fmotels, but when we explained the situation, said to his front desk worker to take 20 dollars off of 120?????  So in short jack up the price to 120 then take off 20 to still make more even thought it was their own clerical error.  When in customer service it is common practice to own up to your mistake and take care of the customer within reasonable parameters.  Not to call the front desk worker while she was in College class and ask her side of the story.  Not to jack up price to make someone think theyre going to get a deatl when it was their own error. Not to be rude and through hate speach and slander about a gay couple. Worst mamagement and etsablishment",
            "The hotel is about 40 min drive to the city. The room was clean and bathroon  was reasonable. Parking was just next to the room door. The bed was not so convenient. There are quite number of breakfast restaurants nearby. The Aircondition had either very hot or very cold positions and both were not acceptable. So only if there is no other choice",
            "We stayed there for one night.room was smelly, bath floor was sticky, bed sheets were clean and rest of everything feels dirty. Tv didn't work. I opened microwave, it has smell and my hand got sticky. Bath tub was dirty. Noisy heating. Reception is so tiny and not pleasant at all",
            "I just spent one night so my rating is mainly influenced by the bad small of the room, probably the smoke of many cigarettes in the past even though the room was a non-smoking one. For the rest bathroom was sufficiently clean and bed confortable. If you have a car you can go to the metro end station called Kippling where you can leave the car and reach downtown in 30 min otherwise it could take longer.\\nPrices were OK considering the high rates of Toronto.",
            "This is a very basic hotel.  In the US I think I'd call it a Motel.  I needed a hotel in a pinch thanks to a canceled flight and wound up here.  The lady at the front desk in the morning is really helpful and nice - she was able to hold my suitcase for the day (which they don't normally do).  If you don't have a car, the bus can take an hour to get to the city center but a cab can get you there in about 20 minutes with traffic.  My view was of a building very close next door.  I do not think I could stay there for a week, but for a night or two, it was okay - and really good considering the price",
            "Hairs in the bed, mattress was sunken in the middle. stale smoke smell, felt dirty and gross staying here. Heard people going at it next door ALL night on a Wednesday, probably a prostitute. We thought it would be safe to turn off the tv at 7am only to hear moaning.\\nAlso the front desk wouldn't loan us a pen.\\nGnar",
            "Needed to be close to Toronto downtown. Stayed for one night, on major street, so there are food options close by. OK hotel for what I needed. Just don't have a lot of expectations. It was relatively clean and well kept. Bring your own shampoo\\u002Fconditioner",
            "Room smelled especially when air conditioner was turned on.\\nFront desk did put calls through and receptionists told my callers that I was not there.

Front door locked but receptionist would open.\\nGood restaurants nearby;  hamburger place next door.  Parking included.\\nFridge and microwave was not plugged in;  then when I found connections, food placed  in the fridge froze except what was on the door.  Asked for iron but had no ironing board.  No electrical plugs nearby",

            "Rented 2 rooms as we were 8. You get what you paid for, and the room did its job. It has a microwave and fridge, the toilet and shower worked, and it was clean. We asked for extra towels and the staff was friendly and readily handed us extra towels for our use. Beds were comfortable in my opinion, and it was agreed on by the rest of my group. 15-20 mins to Rogers centre by car when traffic is good. 2 mins or less to Gardiner expressway and Hwy 427.\\n\\nYou can find a Cora's and a Tim Horton's across the street, and a Burger King right beside the hotel. There are other restaurants within walking distance from the hotel as well.\\n\\nWe are not picky when travelling, but I will admit I had misgivings at 1st.

We stayed for 6 days. Front desk and housekeeping were always friendly. The room was quiet and very relaxing. The bed was comfortable. A lot of great restaurants down the road. My only nitpick was the loss of wifi for hours on two separate days. It was a very relaxing and enjoyable stay",

            "I was in room 102 which is the second room from the road.  It is off the parking lot, which is helpful.  We ran the A\\u002FC all the time, so I heard no noise from the road at all.  The photo made this place look like it was in a much more rural area when it is on a pretty busy street.  Personally, I was glad there was a Burger King next door and it was very close to the expressway.  \\n\\nThe bill is not formatted in the easiest way and I never had to pay in full in advance before.  It was quite late - 1 am, perhaps the clerk was tired, but he was a bit cranky when I asked questions.  The room was immaculately clean, but a bit small.  There was only four feet or so between the end of the bed and the opposite wall.  There was a desk, two chairs, a compact but much larger than a cube, fridge and microwave along there, so the actual walk way was about two feet.  However, the furniture was in good condition, not all beat up like some inexpensive places I have stayed!\\n\\nI was very impressed with the quality of the mattresses- they are Sealy Cardiff Prosense..  It was so nice, I found a place to buy my own.  It is a combination of springs, gel, memory foam and regular padding.  A little give, but not too soft.  The first night, there was a small odor of curry, but I quickly got used to it.  I said something at the office the next day and there was no more for the duration of our stay, 2 more nights.  The maids did an excellent job coming every single day to clean up and make the beds.  One thing you'll really like, the faucet and shower have a lot of water pressure, so you can have a really good shower!   I didn't go to the indoor pool or hot tub - I forgot to bring a swim suit.\\n\\nThe interactions with the rest of the staff were very cordial.  Considering the prices of Toronto hotels, I feel this was very reasonable and I felt very safe there.  The only note - if you are traveling for formal occasions, the room does not have an iron and ironing board.  I did not ask at the office if they have one you can use.  My only real suggestion is they sweep the cigarette butts a little more often from the parking lot.  \\n\\nI would not hesitate to stay here again",
            "When i booked the room i was scared because of some reviews, turns out i had a good experience. the staff, specially the lady in the lobby are very helpful and nice.

Room was clean and front desk was pleasant. Don't know if we would stay there again, but it was a reasonable price",
            "When I was researching hotels in Toronto, my only requirements were for something close to the airport, and as inexpensive as possible. I have frequently been a hostel traveler, but didn't want to be around so many strangers for such a short amount of time. I was able to get a very reasonably priced room at Deluxe, which is just fifteen minutes from the airport by car. It is also on a big road called The Queensway, which has a few bus routes. Most of the hotel smells like stale smoke. This is inevitable for any hotel that allows smoking anywhere. It gets in and on everything. This was also true for the air conditioner. However, if you can deal with that (I can), the bed was comfy enough, the shower was strong and hot, the wifi was quick and, really, you can't beat the price. They seem to be doing some nice upgrades, including washable remotes for the tv and a newly reno'd lobby. Be aware that most of the rooms are upstairs and I did not see an elevator. I did appreciate the fridge and microwave, and found everything to be sufficiently clean and comfortable. If I am traveling through Toronto on a budget again, I would stay here again",
            "I originally reserved this hotel through booking.com, as it had free cancellation and pay at hotel upon arrival, I choose here because it had easy access to Sherway Gardens mall and surrounding shops & it was close to downtown Toronto and the Islington Subway, perfect for me to keep myself occupied while my partner was out working during the day. \\n\\nCheck-in wasn't the best i've ever experienced, as the hotel had actually cancelled my booking before we got there, it wasn't until after we had checked in, that i had realised this, as i received about 10 emails whilst in the air from booking.com saying they had tried to take money from my account, when it was a pay upon arrival, which made me unhappy to start with and i have never had that problem before. \\n\\nWhen we first walked into the room it didn't smell nice,  it was a decent size,one of the wall lights above the tv didn't work, The only good thing was the heater was pretty good and packed out a lot of heat very quickly, which was great when it snowed for two days and became very cold but it did have a smell to it at times. There was a fridge and microwave in the room which we used and they were fine but there wasn't any hot drink facilities in the room but luckily there was a  Timmie's right across the street. \\n\\nThe room was clean so was the bathroom, the cleaners came in nearly everyday but sometimes not till late afternoon 3-4pm, also the walls are thin, we could hear everything in neighboring rooms, there was also a smell of weed coming from the opposite rooms at times, we noticed this whilst heading out in the evenings. The hotel is also between a burger king and a lorry loading facility, we were on the side off the lorry loading facility and would quite often be woken early in the morning by this.   \\n\\nThe bed was clean and quite comfortable but they only supply two pillows which were not that good, so we had to buy an extra one from Walmart as they didn't have extras.\\n\\nThe free wifi was pretty poor, it would often kick us out or we couldn't have more than one laptop or phone connected at a time or it wouldn't work and when it did it was very slow. There was only three plug sockets in the room and the ones they had weren't easily accessible and were also loose on the wall. we did have an alarm clock that i later found two days before we checked out, it had fallen down the back of the bedside cabinet. \\n\\nIf it wasn't for the fact we didn't have a big budget and it was well located, we probably would have moved elsewhere, also if you have a car you might have trouble parking especially friday and saturday nights, if your on a tight budget it is somewhere to stay but if you can afford a bit more i'd go for Motel 6 on Argentia Rd, Mississauga",
            "Overall it was a good experience for me staying for 4 nights. This is not a luxurious hotel and it is a bit old building, but it has everything I needed, comfortable bed, bathroom with hot water, air conditioner, refrigerator, microwave, TV with few channels, daily room service, power plugs and USB plugs for charging.\\n\\nIt has Wi-Fi, but does not always connect and that was bit frustrating, please fix the Wi-Fi. The hotel is in good location with restaurants nearby. The attendants were friendly and helpful. If you are picky person expecting high standard hotel, this is not for you. This is great for budget travelers with managed expectations.\\n\\nThank you Deluxe Inn, \\uD83D\\uDE4F\\uD83D\\uDE0A\\u2764\\uFE0F Budget hotels like these make travel affordable for many. I leave with great memories of Toronto !",

            "Quick check in and Check out, friendly enough staff, great location for us, comfortable bed, not so much the pillows ( we forget to bring ours ). Our room # 142 didn;t have a nice view, next time I will inquiry about getting a room on the other side, found the bathroom too small and outdated, WiFi was on and off, but then again it was the weekend that the whole Rogers problems occured. After reading 1 review from someone stating that there are not enough electrical outlets I would definetly have to agree. Would recommend, will be returning in the fall and will probably book this hotel agai",
            "Very thin walls between the rooms so you hear EVERYTHING going on with your neighbours.  Problems with Wifi frequently, cable TV, and a bathroom fan that sounds like an DC3.  Staff are friendly and attentive.  I think the sign out front says \\\"Newly Renovated Rooms\\\"  but unless that has been up there since the 1980's I don't see what they have recently renovated",
            "I had read really bad reviews for this Motel. I was pleasantly surprised. Although our room was on the ground floor, adjacent to the parking lot, and the windows did not open, the room was clean, the beds were comfortable, and it was handy to have a microwave, and fridge, which we took advantage of. I did not like the fact that the porn channel came on in the morning",
            "The convenient location made me ignore the bad reviews and it turned out to be a gem. New beds, individual climate control, good free internet. Near fast food outlets and Tim Horton's. Smoking and non-smoking rooms with windows that open. Courteous staff.  The quietest rooms face east on 2nd (top) floor away from parking lot. Never mind online booking, call 9am-5pm and book directly for same price or less for longer stays. Beware that there is an adult tv channel included in the cable tv so don't leave children unattended",

            "My wife and I spent 5 nights here. The location was close to the gay village neighbourhood and high-end Yorkville Ave. We were able to walk to most things we wanted to explore. \\n\\nThe hotel room was a cute, cozy, and clean apartment. We had a full kitchen, living space, bedroom, and bathroom with a rainfall shower. It was everything we needed to have a relaxing space to enjoy after a long day of exploring. \\n\\nWe only used housekeeping once since we were only there a few days. If we requested clean towels or toilet paper from the front desk it was brought up in less than 5 minutes. \\n\\nA classic continental breakfast of muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit was provided each morning. \\n\\nWe stayed in a \\u201Cluxury king suite, one bedroom\\u201D booked through Hotels. ca and the room was wonderful.

            "This is an excellent accommodation for anyone seeking a little more room than what a standard hotel offers. Sure there are signs of wear and tear throughout, but the rates are excellent, and the rooms are so spacious. Also, the customer service was absolutely fantastic. All the staff we interacted seemed attentive and willing to go the extra mile to help their guests",
            "I was pleasantly surprised how efficient and friendly the staff is. The room was very clean and comfortable. My favourite part of the entire experience- the room and the sheets smelled fresh unlike that usual stale, hotel smell. The bathroom sink was perfectly functional. Some of you may be chuckling at this, but I seem to experience the clogged\\u002Fslow sink very often at my hotel stays(some of them 4 and 5 stars). It seems that by the time I do my nightly washing the sink gets full that the next person can't even use it. \\nThe checkout went smooth and I was even asked if a ride needed to be arranged for me! Very, very professional and pleasant staff!!",
            "I cannot say enough about the amazing staff here. Check in and out is easy. The staff are polite, professional and efficient. I overbooked as I was coordinating for family members and they released the extra room with no penalty and no questions asked. Value for money is synonomous with the Town Inn Suites in Toronto, especially at a time when hotel stays have really sky rocketed. This still feels afordable without sacrificing expectations for clean and comfy stays. Having the extra room of a kitchen\\u002Fliving room and a one bedroom was perfect with multiple wedding guests staying here. The continental breakfast was great - croissants, yoghurt and lots of coffee in a clean dining area. There is parking (extra fee) and a an easy in\\u002Fout drive so that checking in and dropping luggage is a breeze. This is a great place to stay when in TO and not far from key areas of interest. We stayed here a few years ago at Christmas also and happily the consistency from then til now is noteworthy",
            "We come with a group of 20+ people. The prices are really fair for the rooms we got. Spacious living room with a lot of facilities such as dish washer. Though it's a pity the balcony could not be accessed. Pool and gyms are closed due to the Covid. The staff were super helpful with the recommendations and even helped us to find agencies to book some trips. The service was fast when we needed something. Great location as well,  the street behind the hotel has a lot of restaurants and bars. Close to Eaton Centre",

The kitchen diner was great with loads of space and air conditioning however the rest of the apartment was tired @nd needed updating. No access to the balcony and a tiny windowless bathroom. No air conditioning anywhere except in the kitchen diner. Continental breakfast was limited in variety. Lots of space and facilities for a group of five however I would not stay here again unless all areas were update",

            "The location is good but in a bit of a sketchy area. It is close to subway and Bloor and Yonge which is a plus.  \\n\\nThe walls in our bathroom were filthy and gross with marks all over them.  There is water damage in the unit we were in. \\n\\nThere is but one towel rack in the bathroom and nowhere to hang a wet towel.\\n\\nDo not park in the lower level of the basement as there is NO access to the hotel from there other than to enter a very dark stairwell which leads to the street and around the corner from the entrance.  We mentioned to staff about being unable to open the inside door which is supposed to lead to the elevators (we tried both the room key and the garage access card) and having to navigate the dark stairwell but the door wasn't unlocked nor were we given an explanation on how to open the door by the time we checked out the next day. We were definitely locked out. Don't park on SB, only on B. The entrance on B floor is always open as they put duct tape over the lock mechanism so it doesn't close.\\n\\nUpon entering our room (on a day when it was 31 degrees outside), the AC was set to 78 and the windows in both the living and bedroom were open.  It was so humid. Neither window closed properly and we had to remove the screen to close it as much as possible (because the balconies are inaccessible). The bedroom doesn't have its own AC and despite asking in the evening for a fan, it remained a good 5-10 degrees hotter in the bedroom than in the living room.  The AC worked but didn't go into the bedroom - it was very humid and warm.  We didn't even need a top sheet when we went to sleep because it was so warm.  They did provide a fan but it wasn't a standing one and really didn't help much at all because it was so hot in there. \\n\\nAlso, for paying guests, they shouldn't be charging $40 per night when there are cheaper parking lots in the area.  $30 would be more reasonable for paying guests.\\n\\nFor one night, $300 (including the parking) wasn't worth it.  If you're picky, don't stay here.  If you're willing to \\\"make do\\\", it's ok",

Everything about this suite screams \\u201Ccheap\\u201D from the poor quality flooring to the tiny televisions. To make matters worse, the hotel has no gym, which I consider unacceptable in 2024. There is actually a gym in the building but the hotel has no arrangement for guests to use it. I am really regretting booking at this place",
            "If I could give it zero stars, I would. Filthy, filthy, filthy. For $180 a night you don't expect to have to bring in your own Swiffer. The Swiffer pad was pitch black after we cleaned the floor. \\\"Disgusting\\\" does not begin to describe the place. Pots and pans had old food stuck inside, wine glasses stank of wine and had not been washed. Hair everywhere! Yuck. Stay elsewhere...anywhere else",
            "The pictures on the website are not representative of all of the rooms. It shows a bright and clean space. The suite in which my family stayed was dark and definitely dirty. Several of the pieces of furniture had been replaced as per the pictures, but the kitchen was a galley with dark cabinets.\\n\\nIt is obvious that great care is not taken to clean the rooms as a comment card from a previous resident had been left for us to find. It complained about a banana peel which had been left in one of the drawers in the kitchen for them to find.\\n\\nThere is also a mouse problem, we saw a mouse run across the floor.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the on-site parking was convenient and the staff during check-in and check-out were gracious",

I will stay here again if my travels bring me back to Toronto",

            "The hotel was very accommodating when they could not find my Expedia reservation. They managed to find me room, which they upgraded, and gave me complimentary parking.

            "I've been to various downtown hotels over the years and the rooms are often very small. I really enjoyed this condo-like \\\"suite\\\". Mine had a small kitchen as well as a living room area. Note that the hotel has different types of rooms.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the stay. I also found the bed to be very comfortable. The living room was nicely arranged. Really had an excellent time and would have happily stayed longer",
            "We stay at the town suites inn. This place is an older apartment building that has been upgraded. Rooms were clean.. the room was very hot even with the heat turned off. You cant go out on the balcony they are locked. They dont have anywhere in the bathroom to hang your shower towels..staff are polite",
            "Clean, comfortable and practical accommodation, just as shown in the photograph. Personable check-in staff. We enjoyed a quiet night's sleep. Suite was well-equipped with fridge, stove, toaster, dishes, dishwasher, etc. for eating in. Good space in our suite for sitting together with friends who stayed in an adjacent suite. I would not hesitate to choose Town Inn Suites in future",
            "We recently stayed at the Town Inn Suites.  Room were newly renovated, clean, tastefully decorated, spacious, comfortable, and well equipped.  Nothing was lacking.  Staff was cheery, friendly, and super helpful.  It was a truly wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend this place.  Also great was its perfect location to restaurants and shops",
            "Had to review! Stayed twice in 1 week, seeing 2 rooms, 1 with kitchen and 1 without. Both were perfectly clean, spacious, well decorated and comfortable.  The staff was very helpful; you got the impression, they all wanted to make sure your stay was the best it could be. Parking ($30 per night) was a little pricey, but easy to use and very convenient, appreciated. The atmosphere on colourful Church street and the convention shops surrounding the hotel greatly added to our seamless, stress free stay. You\\u2019ll definitely feel safe.  Across the street and south 100m is a great coffee shop in the morning and a pub in the evening, providing a perfect start and end to your day.  Do not hesitate to stay at this hotel, period",
            "I had stayed at this hotel years ago, and I was aware that hotel had gone through renovations but did not know what to expect..  When I booked room originally there wasn't two double beds room available online.  When I checked I asked if one was available, the manager quickly looked into it, and was able to give me a suite, at nominal increase in price.  When I walked in the room I was totally surprised how beautiful it was.  It was very modern, clean, and comfortable, the suite was very large.  It had stove, microwave, dishwasher, where I made good use of the appliances, during my 4 day stay.  The cleaning staff was a very sweet lady, and accommodated me with towels, toiletry, dish washer detergent, etc, I had told her it was ok not to make beds etc, I would take care of it. The location is great spot, close to many amenities, restaurants, shopping, few blocks away from Bloor St.  Wi Fi was free, and used it a lot for work and leisure. I was pleasantly surprised of this hotel and will plan to visit there again",
            "It's not the nicest hotel in Toronto but it checks off all the boxes in terms of everything you'd need from a hotel. Rooms are big with a kitchen, although I didn't use it. There was also a free breakfast, which didn't have a ton of options, but helps with a quick start to the day. The staff are great and I'd probably come back",

Staff was very informative and detailed. On what hotel offered. Hotel offers complimentary breakfast from 7am again lounge is nicely decorated and updated. Has a pool and sauna for your personal use.   Hotel is in an amazing location close to all attractions and walking location to shops. Hotel staff was very helpful Assisting with our needs. Room was modern and nicely decorated. Only thing about this hotel is there is a $1000 deposit required for stay even though we  only spending one night. However due to the hotel amenities inside the room fridge stove microwave and newly update could understand why. When booking wanting great location and feeling the comforts of home away from home this is a great place to stay",
            "I stayed here for 6 nights and it was lovely. The on-site parking, though a little pricey, was a huge selling point and very convenient. Just a block from the train station, there's a bodega across the street, and the staff was pleasant and competent. I would absolutely stay here again",

Our room was beautiful, King size bed with Fully equipped Kitchen , living room. Our room was very clean ,everything we needed was there, such an amazing place , parking is on premises , and breakfast offered is across the street. The pool was not opened at this time, understanding, but look forward to our next visit. amazin",

Fully equipped kitchen which we used mainly for the fridge, has dishes and cutlery, as well as a corkscrew.\\n\\nHousekeeping daily for new towels, emptied trash, and made beds.\\n\\nBreakfast is limited, but you can bring back to the room",
            "I stayed in a suite here for 2 weeks while looking for somewhere permanent to rent. My suite was perfectly fine, not high end luxury but not budget either. It had quite a large kitchen and living space, a bathroom (with a shower but not a bath), and a separate bedroom. I wasn't here on holiday so it was nice to have some form of kitchen to cook with. The kitchen had most things you would need.\\n\\nThe bedroom was a little on the small side, partly because there was a huge king sized bed and not much room for anything else. The bathroom was nice, but I had some problems with the hot water in that I had to leave the shower running for 30 minutes sometimes before it got to a reasonable temperature to shower in. Since moving into a condo in Toronto I have the same problem, so I wonder if it's a common thing here.\\n\\nThe wifi was a little slow but functional. I had to sign in again every 24 hours which got irritating given I was there 2 weeks.\\n\\nI stayed here during the COVID-19 pandemic and I was self isolating here after arriving in Canada. The staff were mostly accommodating of this. The only issue I had was requests getting misinterpreted when calling down to reception for something, usually ending up in them bringing the wrong thing or too much of something which was wasteful. Because of the circumstances during my stay, the location made little difference. But if I were getting about, I think I might have found the location a little too far away from the centre",
            "Stayed here for 5 days. The staff are extremely  helpful and efficient and have a professional  style. We were upgraded to a lovely apartment before we left Australia  perhaps  because  we mentioned  that we were on our honeymoon!! Jun couldn't  do enough for us with emails back and forth, prior to us beginning  our trip across  Canada. The Deluxe King Suite was lovely..even has a kettle!!! Kitchen is very modern with good appliances  and full size oven and stove top. Large microwave oven, and very large stainless steel  fridge. The only minus was the free breakfast.  Very basis choices indeed..\\nThere is a decent grocery store at the corner of the next block, which is a few minutes  walk ( a convenience  store is directly across from the hotel) (didn't go to that one). A hairdressing  salon is just around the corner and Croissant  Tree restaurant  is diagonally  opposite.  This eatery is great for any time of the day meals or snacks. Very cheap quality food in a nice setting.. There is a coin laundry in the hotel and an indoor pool. Dog friendly  too. Definitely  would recommend this  hotel",
            "We had a really excellent stay. The room was clean. The hotel manager and his staff are so friendly and efficient - they are like a family. Excellent location downtown. Everything you will need is in the apartment and the kitchen is fully equipped. The Wifi is fast and reliable. Would definitely recommend this place",
            "The place is excellent. Great location. Very clean and wide accommodation.Staffs were very welcoming. It will always be my home away home in Toronto. Parking was clean and safe. I didn\\u2019t mind to pay for the parking because it was reasonable. But it could be awesome if it were free",
            "I arrived early and in the rain. I was able to store luggage, check in early and helped find the museum by the very friendly front desk staff.\\nMy room with a king sized bed was clean and comfortable. I loved having my own kitchenette.\\nThe view was lovely and I will definitely stay again",
            "One of the best hotels I've stayed at. The Aircondition worked, so many kitchen appliances, the room was spacious, the bed was big and locations was okay with nearby A&W and other restaurants. We didn't bother with the breakfast anymore hehe",
            "This suite hotel must have been nice when it was an apartment. It hasn't been kept up. the balcony doors are locked. I asked if mine could be opened, and was told that they have been locked for years, and could not be opened. The kitchen is fine to keep things in the fridge and heat things up in the microwave, but I wouldn't be excited to cook in it. It does come with an included  breakfast of coffee\\u002Ftea muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit",
            "The Place is close to Downtown.  This neighborhood is known as \\u201Cgay Village\\u201D.  It\\u2019s not a problem for us, but some may don\\u2019t like.  People from the hotel were very nice.  In fact, our suite was a huge apartment complete, with 2 bed rooms, kitchen And 1 bathroom.   No breakfast.   Ideal for familys and thouse who travel in small groups",
            "Really enjoyed my stay here. The suites are quite spacious and I really enjoyed having a full kitchen with COVID and all\\u2026 The staff were friendly and super helpful when I needed some recommendations. Looking forward to my next visit here",
            "I booked the Junior Suite with kitchenette, and a washer & dryer. These were extremely useful! It had a full-sized refrigerator and stove, and a dishwasher.  The suite was very, very clean and comfortable. I was on a high floor, with a great eastern view (note that there is construction on the west side.) Front desk staff are very professional and attentive. They recommended the purchase of a monthly parking pass to save me money. I also recommend using transit downtown. The Bloor\\u002FYonge subway interchange is less than a five minute walk away, and the subway is accessible (elevators and escalators - at least in the city core). The neighbourhood is people-friendly, and well served by caf\\u00E9s, restaurants, shopping, and small grocery markets nearby. Internet service was very good. I don\\u2019t have cable tv at home, and enjoyed watching that. NOTE: As with many suite hotels, housekeeping will visit only once per week; I didn\\u2019t need anything, but the front desk would have obtained extra towels, etc. I would have stayed longer if I could have, and the Town Inn will be my base the next time I am in Toronto. Book early so you get a high floor and a better view!  NOTE ALSO: if you park at the hotel, there are stairs from the parking garage to the elevators. I managed fine, but persons with more severe mobility issues will need to be dropped off at the front entrance or use the \\u201CGreen P Parking\\u201D on Charles Street.\\nThis hotel is an exceptional value for the city centre. Thank you, Town Inn!",
            "I was looking for a place that had a kitchen, and so this hotel provided a great full kitchen. But the suite was extremely bland, with laminate floors, plain walls, and Ikea-style furnishings. No personality at all. The room was large but I would have gladly given up half the space for an ounce of elegance and aesthetic appeal. The old-fashioned heating unit never got the room temperature above 19 degrees and so I had to get a space heater in order to bring the room to a comfortable temperature. Despite the website saying that the hotel had been renovated, the bathroom was the style of a Motel 6. The bathtub was strongly stained, giving it a very shabby appearance. There was no hook to hang bath towels. On the plus side, the parkade was very convenient, running $30\\u002Fnight. The staff was extremely friendly, with a very pleasant check-in. One drawback that is not due to the hotel itself is that it is directly across the street from a large construction site. Construction began at 6 am, hence not allowing for a full night\\u2019s sleep",
            "Great central location, close to food, shopping. Overall good value for money, and recently renovated apartment suites. Front desk staff are friendly and professional. Underground parking is a bit pricey so suggest checking other nearby garages. \\n\\",

            "My family and I, including 2 cats,  had to find an affordable place to stay while we were putting our condo on the market to sell. The location had to have a full kitchen and enough space for us all and more importantly would allow flexibility on the duration and of course accept pets.  Town Inn Suites was just the spot in the city. Super friendly, kind and professional staff, amazing location, clean and very diligent when it came to bring us items we needed"

We arrived to what appeared to be a very annoyed front desk manager who didn't even acknowledge me when I walked up. After I said hello he told me that the other person would help me. Neither of them were friendly, and we did not feel welcome at all. They did not explain the parking, and coldly told me the that it would be $50 when I asked how it worked. \\n\\nWe were satisfied with the cleanliness of the second room that we were given however the first room was not made up or ready for us, and we had to transfer rooms.

            "Construction was being done in a building across the street - buzz-sawing and hammering all night long.  In desperation, I called the front desk at midnight to ask about noise bylaws.  The first person was sympathetic and said \\\"If we can find a room on the other side of the building, would you be willing to move?\\\"  Keep in mind for later in the story...a hotel representative is offering me another room.  I said yes because I desperately wanted to get sleep before the work meetings I had flown in for.  He said okay, I'll transfer you to reservations.  The reservations guy was HORRIBLE.  He found a room, but told me it would be a $40 upgrade.  I said I'm checking out in the morning, so I get no advantage from an upgraded room.  He said \\\"You're getting an upgrade, so you have to pay for it\\\".  I said \\\"Why, nobody else is going to check in tonight to that room at midnight, you're not losing money by moving me\\\"  He said, \\\"I have 13 people who say they are arriving tonight\\\".  I said, \\\"Yes, but you've already booked rooms for them.\\\"  He said, \\\"well, one of them might want to upgrade\\\"!!!!   I couldn't believe it.  The illogic of it was bad enough...but I think what really got me is you could tell he just didn't care.  Didn't care about my discomfort, didn't care about the customer.  To add insult to injury, on the way out in the morning the front desk clerk said \\\"We're sorry about the noise issue you experienced\\\".   Well, one of you wasn't too sorry at all.\\nAll the other reviews about this hotel's windows not blocking any sound are correct",

As we wanted a quiet night in I read on their website that:\\n\\n\\\"Every room also comes with a modern 55\\u201D Flatscreen LED TV that allows you to cast your own media from any mobile device\\\". \\n\\nWhen I called the front desk I was told that this hotel doesn't have that feature and they would have to call their marketing team to get that description removed from their website. As of this review, it is still up. \\n\\nNot to mention, all the TV's are locked down with tamper proof hardware so no one is able to utilize the TV's in the room except for basic low res cable. \\n\\nI'm disappointed at the blatant false advertising and it's no wonder why people are more inclined to booking Airbnbs that don't try to limit their customers",
            "Thanks Barbie, you made our day \\uD83D\\uDE4F\\uD83C\\uDFFB\\nBusy morning, running late, had to leave the dishes from breakfast in the sink. Came back to the room after a long day out. Dear ms Barbie had cleaned it all - the room was nice and clean and we could relax .. \\nThanks again \\uD83D\\uDE4F\\uD83C\\uDFF",
            "The photos of this hotel are beautiful, and the rooms are well decorated for what the hotel is, but it's not  quite as elegant as the photos would lead you to believe.\\nWe were on the 18th floor, which appeared to be under some renovations. The hallway was half painted, there was a plastic bag cover flapping off the vent in the hall.  It looks like an old apartment building that was renovated to be a hotel - popcorn ceilings would indicate circa 1970's.  The rooms were ok, there were several nail pops and marks in the plaster.  The \\\"balcony\\\" overlooked a garbage dumpster and the sides of some office buildings.\\nThere was a large TV in the studio, but the content was all stretched from a full screen input to widescreen, so it all looked pretty odd.\\nThe shower was nice, but the faucet was leaking consistently, had to keep the door closed to avoid being kept awake by the constant drip.\\nOverall it was fine, but given the option on another site for the Hyatt Regency for the same last minute price, it wasn't the best value",
            "I only stayed one night but service was great. Front desk was helpful and was able to check me in early without any issue. Room lay out is great also,  this will definitely be my go to hotel in Toronto. Enjoy",
            "I can't say enough about how accommodating and helpful the staff are at this hotel.  They really care about your experience, and do whatever they can to make that happen.  The location is fantastic...right on TTC...walkable to many places.  There were a couple of cleaning misses in the suite, which was disappointing.  Everything else was great and I would stay here again...",
            "The staff were so friendly and helpful the whole stay. The location is also great for attending events.  You can easily walk to the Scotiabank centre. I couldn\\u2019t hear anyone else from our room, which is perfect, as I have stayed at other hotels where you can hear parties and guests",
            "Given it was New Year\\u2019s Eve we were expecting it to be very busy and loud but it was the complete opposite. There was a bit of noise from a room on our floor but it didn\\u2019t last long so it really wasn\\u2019t a big deal. Our stay was ok... the location is great although the hotel is tucked away on a tiny side street which isn\\u2019t necessarily a bad thing unless you want a view from your window. Views are basically nonexistent unless I assume you\\u2019re in a very high floor. If not you\\u2019re either looking at a wall or an ally with some garbage bins. I\\u2019ve stayed at the hotel quite a few times over the years and can\\u2019t ever remember having any sort of view. It\\u2019s not an issue for me since I live just outside the city but a tourist may not look at it the same way. Room service wasn\\u2019t cheap but surprisingly very good. The rooms are a good size with have a kitchenette which is nice but they do look a bit tired so they could use a bit of a refresh. Beds are small and not the most comfortable but not the worst either. Overall I think hotel is good for someone looking for a value hotel stay in Toronto but there are also a lot of other options to choose from",
            "Here are some points I was disapointed about : \\n\\nDirty towels\\nRoom maintenance service was poor. They didn't fix my sheets and change my towels on 2 out of 6 days. \\nThe view was nothing near a city view.\\n\\nPrice was not matching service\\",
            "The location was within walking distance to many popular venues. The bar in the hotel was very upscale and modern with excellent service. Check in and out was a breeze. The room was like a little apartment. We will definitely be returning",
            "The hotel was very clean.  The staff was very helpful.  The continental breakfast buffet was very good.  We had dinner at the hotel which was delicious.  The hotel is within walking distance to Meridian Hall which was the reason for our stay as we were going to a concert there.  Would definitely stay there again",
            "Very uncomfortable stay. This hotel is rundown - don't be fooled by the pictures! The bed mattress was uneven, bedsheets were itchy and the pillows felt like sleeping on bricks - very uncomfortable. Walls are very thin too!\\nViews were looking into an office building and then an adjacent room and balcony (we were on level 20). Room service is only upon request before 6pm the day prior. Only plus is the location. Other than this, I don't recommend staying here, unless you want to punish yourself",
            "The hotel was really clean and my room was very spacious.\\n\\nAll of the staff were warm and welcoming, especially Getu who was awesome! He was super helpful when I was checking in, as he provided me with all of the information I needed. \\n\\nI highly recommend this hotel",
            "I booked this hotel for a work trip and based my choice on the online photos and reviews expecting a lot from this hotel. My friend and I walked in and immediately questioned everything we had been expecting from our stay. The staff barely acknowledged us when we walked in, it was dark with poor lighting and the signage was difficult for our uber driver to find. After we checked in and made our way to our rooms (my friend and I had separate rooms), we were immediately turned off as we walked into room 1. The room looks very much like low-income housing\\u002Fa dorm room (we had Studio rooms). The bedding in my friend's room had stains and the room did not look like it had been actually cleaned. Both rooms had dust and dirt built up on the corners of the rooms and behind the headboard (I didn't really want to take my shoes off). Throw pillows had stains. The bed sits awkwardly with the headboard against a sliding door and the room is all floor to ceiling windows\\u002Fsliding doors, making the bedroom extremely cold and no duvet was provided, only providing what I would describe as a couch throw blanket (the heat was turned off as well). All the bedroom furniture (both rooms) were in pretty rough shape and beaten up, it looked as if it had all been donated or bought second hand. After seeing the rooms, we spoke to the front desk and inquired about their cancellation policy, which luckily because we hadn't booked through a third-party website, we were able to check out the following day. The front desk staff simply shrugged and had no issues with us checking out after one day (instead of the 5 days we were supposed to be there), as if it was a common occurrence. After we left and had dinner, we returned to the hotel to call it a night and went to our rooms. My room had lights that flickered non-stop, and the shower door would not close. My blinds in my bedroom did not reach to the end of the window, and I was unable to even get dressed in my room without being on display for all the other facing windows to my room. My friend's room had a door which did not latch properly and constantly rattled, so it sounded like someone was attempting to enter the room all night. Also worth mentioning, you can hear anything and anyone in the hallways from your bed, which also did not help trying to sleep in this environment.\\n\\nAll in all, I think this hotel would have been decent if I knew what I was walking into. It would be no more than a 2.5\\u002F 3 star at BEST and should cost no more than 149 a night, and not the 329 before taxes. DO NOT trust the photos posted by the hotel. Other than its location, I would not recommend this hotel",
            "I had occasion to stay at the Cosmopolitan again, after a long period of not travelling, for a business trip in recent weeks. I was there for five days, and some of my team also stayed there off and on during that time.\\n\\nAs usual, the reservation process was seamless and the General Manager was very helpful in accommodating a special request upon booking.\\n\\nThe staff is also extremely accommodating. Take a moment to get to know them - they are all kind and interesting folks who will do everything they can to help you. They are extremely professional and will match the energy you bring.\\n\\nThe hotel is centrally located, very clean, well kept, very quiet (apart from the city noises no one can avoid) and having the amenities of a washer\\u002Fdryer, stovetop, dishwasher, etc makes the trip even easier. The balconies made all the difference in the world, and helped us all feel less 'cooped' in. \\n\\nDespite the fact that I had innumerable zoom-type meetings, the wifi never failed me. The convenience of having a drop off table for UberEats. etc. orders in the lobby makes deliveries easy and safe. The beds are comfortable, and the shower water pressure is incredible.\\n\\nThe staff at Wildfire (hotel restaurant) are very easygoing and accommodating and the food is great.\\n\\nI won't hesitate to stay there again - nor will I hesitate to recommend it to anyone",
            "The hotel is quaint and in a great location. Very hidden but close to everything.  The rooms were nice and prices were good. A little tired in some areas, the bathroom needed some updates with paint etc. I would stay here again",
            "Very friendly and helpful staff, Naseem went out of his way to help us with parking. Rooms were very clean, staff in the restaurant were very  attentive and service was excellent. All in all we would recomend this hotel, very conveniently located, walking distance to many attractions",
            "Great location, close to Union Station, pubs, restaurants, St. Lawrence market, coffee shops, grocery store.  In a safe area & on a quiet street. \\n\\nWe had the Executive View Suite, fantastic views from both bedroom and living space! Could see the city and CN tower.  Floor to ceiling windows. Loved the balcony! Full kitchen, washer\\u002Fdryer, safe for your valuables. Bed with bamboo sheets was very comfortable. Rahi and Leo were friendly and helpful.  Small but very stylish lobby.  Cool, nicely decorated pub \\u002F restaurant in the hotel.  \\n\\nViews and room amenities made this so much better than the average hotel room.  Really helped make our Toronto experience.  We will definitely be back and highly recommend the Cosmopolitan",
            "Getu and Liam front desk staff very friendly. Could not ask for kinder treatment from them. The housekeeping team kinda sucks sadly. As they're not doing daily room cleaning due to COVID, I asked for new towels. Someone brought be some new ones however, upon realizing they were wet I went back to the hall stopped and asked him why they were wet. \\\"There's nothing wrong with them he replied,\\\" and walked off. Do they not have dryers? You cannot gives guests half dried towels. I has a suite, yet it was not equipped with pots pans plates etc. When I called asking for a kettle, knife forks etc. they explained that they had removed those items in order to properly sanitize them. Fine to remove them but put them back. I had to call down so many times and continually ask for things. They also do not have kitchen paper towel. I used kleenex and bathroom towels as kitchen towels. I suspect my room was not properly cleaned\\u002Fwiped either- saw strands of hair from previous guest. By the way it can be quite noisy as its in the heart of downtown and they do really loud street cleaning at night- be mindful of this. Opt for higher floor to avoid loud street noise. Finally, I saw what seems to be a dried blood stain on blanket (see photo). Overall, I was not impressed by housekeeping",
            "The front of house staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was exactly what we had anticipated and was perfect for a short business trip, although I'm sure it would be nice long-term as well. The suite had a great view and good internet, perfect for a short business trip. Would stay there again because of the location and size of the suite",
            "I really appreciated the decor and the vibe. The restaurant was impressive. Great service! The location is idea for work and also for leisure. It is set just off Yonge which offers easy low stress arrivals and departure",
            "This hotel was perfectly adequate, and room had a kitchen, laundry etc; staff were helpful especially Rafi (sp?) with my bags. But the restaurant was closed for Sunday and Monday when I arrived (because nobody eats then)?  The rather indifferent guy at the front desk told me there were lots of restaurants 'over that way' but in fact the few accessible through construction debris were all closed. I walked for almost an hour on dark gloomy streets near Yonge Street  (as a lone woman) asking people and other hotels (which were much more helpful) where to find a restaurant, but finally could find only one Japanese place (yay but it was jammed full) and a sports bar open. And that was just by accident. My point here is that if you are going to close your restaurant for heaven's sake have the decency to do some research so you can accurately advise guests as to alternatives.  Won't stay here again in this sketchy area",
            "First time here and was very impressed. I will be back. Just off of Young street tucked away down a small lane way. Very quiet and staff were all very professional and made me feel at home. The valet parking was also handy but didn\\u2019t have to use it",
            "We stayed for 3 nights and everything was splendid. The staff is very nice and helpful, the location is very central and convenient and the amenities are very comfortable. The rooms are like little houses, very well equipped with kitchen, cutlery, washers and drier and everything you may need. I definitely recommend and would stay again when in Toronto",
            "Spacious modern well equipped rooms\\u002Fstudios.  The staff were exceptionally gracious and warm, from the restaurant manager to the lovely housekeeping staff who greet you warmly in the hallways. The breakfast is quite delicious: not the standard overcooked scrambled eggs! A buffet of cheeses\\u002FBrie, warm croissants, meats ... very impressed",
            "When we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff who immediately guided us to some parking. The beds in the room were comfy, really enjoyed having a kitchen right in the room and the view from our balcony was breathtaking. I can\\u2019t remember the name of the gentleman who was working the evening of July 17th, however he was so helpful with directions and getting us set up with a different tv remote as our wasn\\u2019t able to set up the Xbox. Everyone working was so friendly and easy to talk to. The hotels safety features really make your stay feel more comfortable. I\\u2019d recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in the heart of downtown as you can walk to dining, bars, attractions and just about everything else. We\\u2019ll be looking into staying here again",
            "Staff were very friendly and responsive. We loved the room (although wondered why a place with a kitchenette had not one pot or cooking implement). Bed was pretty good. Daily breakfast offerings were fantastic. Friday housekeeping was great. Weekend cleaning was an issue. Saturday\\u2019s was late (we came back at 3 having been out most of the day) and our room was just being done. Since we were back the cleaner worked quickly - did the bathroom, changed some towels, and made the bed. Floor wasn\\u2019t done, but we didn\\u2019t make an issue of it. Went out Sunday just before lunch; came back at 3, saw the cleaner on the floor and went to the lobby to wait for him to finish. Came back up 25 mins later and found our room not done, despite the \\u2018service please\\u2019 sign left on our door. Concierge did send someone up right away who changed the towels, cleaned bath and made the bed, although floor still not done (salt stains and grit from previous day still there). Coffee table & desk had finger prints so I cleaned them myself. Bedding not changed; we didn\\u2019t mind, although the card by the bed states that bedding was to be changed on third night of stay (it was our third night). \\n\\nThere are some great things about this hotel, although the weekend cleaning (schedule or staff, cannot say which) does need work",
            "I got at least 5 texts and emails prior to arrival.  You're not my boyfriend.  Quit contacting me over the same stuff, especially AFTER I downloaded the app \\\"required\\\" for checking in and getting a digital key.\\n\\nI still had to check in at the front desk, but the nice man spent about 15 minutes trying to get the digital key to work, even though he'd already asked me how many (hard) keys I wanted.  \\n\\nAfter I'd been in the room for about an hour, I got another text saying that my digital key was ready.  \\n\\nI placed an order at the bar for a hamburger and fries.  All I asked for extra was mayo and ketchup and it took this guy about 10 mins to ring it up!  After he clicked and clicked and clicked, I finally asked him if he was typing a love letter or something.  \\n\\nIt was a bit annoying, too that I couldn't charge it to my room.  Well, maybe weird is a better word.  I guess the restaurant isn't really part of the hotel, even though it's open next to the lobby.\\n\\nThe room itself was very old-fashioned.  VERY much in need of an update.  This is downtown Toronto!  Not a roadside motor lodge from the 1970s.  \\n\\nI liked the separate kitchenette area, and very much appreciated the Keurig and the cold AC.  However, the AC blew on the shades and they rattled all night.  Again, not a big deal but it isn't what I expect for the amount I paid!  \\n\\nAlso, the shutter needed about 4\\\" more to keep light out.  \\n\\nI definitely won't be staying here again",
            "Location cannot be beat. Period. The people working there are all so professional, courteous and friendly, from the front desk to the service people you bump into in the halls. The setup of the rooms are perfect, with everything you need, including a kitchenette to cut costs. Everything seems recently refreshed in terms of upkeep. Stylish without being fussy about it. I booked at the last minute, through HotelTonight. Got a great price. When I was there, they had a promo so I also got an amazing deal on their breakfast buffet, which features a wide range of options, hot and cold. The gym is small but has everything you need, in good repair  (including a Peleton, which I didn't use, but was surprised to see). There is free use of a jacuzzi pool in their spa (which you have to book ahead of time) but no pool. When I was there, they were about to begin their Winterlicious offerings of prix fixe lunch and dinner menus at a reduced price at their in-house restaurant, Viv. The food looked very good. They were very attentive and made sure you had everything you need, even suggesting things that might make your stay, or your foray into the city, better. The absolutely only downside of this stay was that some nearby building was doing some renovation and, unbelievably, was doing some of that renovation in the middle of the night. That has to be against the law. I was up quite high in the building. You can't hear it from the lower levels, apparently, but up high, there are a lot of equivalently tall buildings  creating sound canyons that reflect and amplify every noise. So every truck that is backing up, every I beam that is being dropped into place, every yell from a worker or fire engine siren reverberates through these spaces and makes it very hard to have an undisturbed night's sleep. But, in truth, that's not the hotel's fault. They really did a great job of creating a terrific oasis in a remarkably handy corner of a fantastic, and fantastically interesting, city",
            "We rented a room in the hotel for a long term stay of  month and was extremely  happy with aspects of the stay.  The room was large, bright and well appointment with modern furnishings.  The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful and always attentive.  The hotel is in a superb location, very safe and close to all that downtown has to offer",
            "I cannot believe some of these poor reviews. I have been here on an extended stay (6 months) while doing a renovation. \\n\\nI found the hotel to be clean, room is spacious especially for a downtown hotel with a restaurant that has both great food and service. The bed was comfortable, as was the couch to relax and watch television. The gym is not huge but it has everything you need including a Peleton.\\n\\nThe staff at the hotel are friendly and quite personable. They are quite busy but would go out of their way if I ever needed their assistance. You cannot beat this location, as you are just off Yonge St. with the subway right around the corner.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting or opting to do an extended stay as I did",
            "The Executive Cosmopolitan staff were lovely and very kind. The room was clean, and perfect for any type of getaway - whether you\\u2019re staying overnight, or for an extended period - they\\u2019re spacious, and have a kitchenette for those who are looking to avoid eating out for every meal. The hotel also has great amenities and it\\u2019s in a great location. Definitely recommended",
            "A great location, walking distance to Union station, Distillery district, with great amenities including washing machine and dryer which were really useful. Helpful, friendly staff. Views not great from the 15th floor but we could catch a glimpse of the CN Towe",
            "The room\\u002F studio was spacious, comfortable & very clean. All amenities were present & in working order. Staff are amazingly helpful & friendly.  Restaurant food is great - only downside is lack of breakfast  Would happily recommend this hotel",
            "Booked this hotel very last minute for NYE. Rooms have an odd layout but Queen bed was comfortable really large tv with lots of channel. Appreciated the small kitchen but did not use except for refrigerator and microwave which worked fine. Balcony is a nice size but no view at all. The windows surrounding the entire bedroom were also something I could of done without as you don\\u2019t want all the people from all the surrounding building looking inside your entire room so kept the window shades down the entire stay. No place to really store luggage or clothing (only 3 really small size draws at the tiny desk). Best amenity was the use of the indoor jacuzzi at the spa on the 4th floor. Gym is super small but each time I visited I was the only person so it was okay but more than 4-5 people the gym would be uncomfortably small.\\nI\\u2019ve stayed at better locations in the city and wouldn\\u2019t put this on the top of my list next time I\\u2019m in town",
            "The staff is helpful and friendly. The hotel is perfectly located and if a kitchenette is needed, it's the perfect pick. I usually stay at the Omni King Edward, but this time needed to stay and eat inside the hotel due to covid 19. I do recommend this hotel",
            "Hidden Gem!  Booked it last minute.\\nStayed for one night and exceeded beyond expectations. Reasonably priced. Close to Union Station, Financial District, Yonge Street.  The check in process & staff was seamless.  They were honest, friendly, and responsive. I would go back again. The room I got had a balcony,  which would be awesome for the summer. Room was spacious and clean. It came with the kitchen, washer dryer, walk in shower. \\nThank you for making my night stay comfortable",
            "I was in Executive View Suite for 5 nights and it has everything as what you have in your apartment like kitchen, laundry and balcony. It made me feel like home as a independent person. The most bonus about the room is the view when I look out the window especially after wake up in the morning and night. The sun really brighten the whole room. \\n\\nOn my first day, I was expecting the pot, pans, tablewares, cutlery and utensils but it was all empty because of COVID. I salute them for taking it seriously to protect the staffs and guests. It did made me feel extra comfortable in my stay. I did request to bring those in my room because I wanted to cook and they brought it no problem. They don't bring everything because they weren't sure what I need but they would bring it if I requested specifically. \\n\\nThe staffs were very nice and professional. I felt very welcome. I'm hearing impaired and the front desk was willing to repeat it for me while she has mask on. As a hearing person while other person wearing mask don't mixed well together.\\n\\nI enjoy my stay overall and I will definitely come back",
            "Front desk check-in was simple and efficient had my room within 10 minutes (checked in at 3pm).  Hotel was clean and trendy not large so very nice boutique vibe.  I had pre booked a Signature suite via hotels.com with a kitchenette and living area and room recieved was exactly as booked. Clean, spacious and comfortable.  Kitchen was stocked with glassware and dishware as well as some pay per use beverages in the fridge (cans of beer, smaller liquor bottles and wine). There is a washer\\u002Fdryer in the room nice for longer stays.  Large LG tv with good channels which is wall mounted but can be angled to the bed or living area or kitchenette. Closet had robes and slipper.  The one slight disadvantage was the balcony was not quite suitable for standing on as it was a sliding door with a railing right across it about 10\\\" in depth from door to railing.  But that was not a problem for me but may be for some.  All in all I would definately recommend and stay here again. Great location with many local amenities a walk away.",

There is also a washing machine and a drier. There were two televisions, one in the bedroom and another one in the kitche-living room.

There's a  keurig in the \\n room as well as a mini fridge freezer microwave large screen tv and a smaller one in the bedroom. My room is near the cleaners cupboard so a bit noisy...

Very comfortable. The rooms are very dry and you get a lot of static electricity, so be careful when you touch the door handles! No carpet made it feel fresh and clean. My only complaint was that the in-room Keurig did not work",
            "Anything you need or want in a hotel, they have it. Two TVs, a freaking balcony, a kitchenette with a microwave, fridge, stovetop, and silverware. Located downtown (walking distance to the harbour front and an LCBO). Highly recommend",

            "I was looking for a hotel that could accommodate my business needs (a place to work, kitchenette to prepare small food dishes and a condo feel) and also a place where I could bring a couple guests to entertain before a night out.

Understandably, it's a historic building and there may be limitations for them to upgrade their elevators.\\n\\nThe lobby is always crowded and loud during lunch and dinner time, as they have the restaurant\\u002Fcafe right there. \\n\\nThe check-in was fast and easy, and the staff was very friendly.\\n\\nWe still left a tip for the house cleaning staff despite having no tea bags and was surprised to get a thank you note.\\n\\nOverall, it's an ok hotel. There are many other better choices (and newer hotels) in the proximity. For the price they charge, we are not getting the value for our money",
            "We had the pleasure of staying at One King West over this past weekend and once again it was amazing.  \\n\\nMy partner and I were invited for a corporate weekend getaway and from the moment we arrived at the hotel were were welcomed with warm hospitality.  The main lobby of the hotel has energy and invites you to sit, relax and enjoy a drink or two!  Our room was well appointed and spacious with incredible views of the CN Tower and the downtown core.  \\n\\nWe spent an evening enjoying a meal prepared by Chef Akshay and his team.  Everything from the seafood towers, Beef Tenderloin and Chocolate Ganache Dessert were to die for.  Every bite was like heaven.  The service was impeccable and there was not a detail missed.  The night air was unusually mild considering the time of year and we were able to enjoy the Toronto views from the terrace while sipping bubbly.   \\n\\nPlease be sure to visit The Daily Ritual when on site - incredible coffee, pastries and sandwiches.  I personally could not get enough of the coffee, I returned each afternoon as well.  The Daily Ritual team were also a pleasure to meet - big smiles despite the early morning rush!\\n\\nThank you One King West - A big shout out to Hotel Manager Saurabh Mehta and his team for another memorable experience!  We look forward to our next visit to Toronto",
            "Always amazing and the staff goes above and beyond to  to exceed your expectations. Beautiful suites with awesome views and cleanliness is top notch. Hopefully stage 3 opens up the beautiful restaurant and bar, miss the amazing food and service. Great protocols in place for COVID-19, sanitizers everywhere, properly placed sings on the floor to ensure everyone can follow social distancing. Can\\u2019t wait to come back next month for another awesome weekend, don\\u2019t change a thing and continue doing what you are",
            "This was our 3rd stay at One King West Hotel, each time spending a day\\u002Fnight in Toronto experiencing the great attractions and to unplug, so far we have enjoyed the Winter Festival, Aquarium and River Dance. The location is excellent, being attached to the underground shopping and services of the PATH.  \\nWhen one enters the OKW, you are treated as their priority; check-in was courteous, efficient and informative, ensuring our needs were being met to the fullest. \\nRooms are well appointed and clean, we had a one bedroom suite with a well equipped kitchenette on the 47th floor, beds extremely comfortable, all linens and duvet were spotlessly white.  The sitting area was spacious with a stunning view of the lake. We had, as always a very quiet, restful sleep!\\nBefore our dinner\\u002Fshow we stopped into Tellers lounge for a cocktail and chatted with a fellow who travels to Toronto frequently, has stayed at many hotels downtown, he continues to book OKW now. \\nAll staff (front and back of house) acknowledges and greets guests, they are mindful their required duties may be disrupting one but absolutely did not.  \\nWhen asked on a survey what could OKW improve? My reply was \\u201Ckeep doing what you are doing!\\u201D\\nWe will absolutely find another destination downtown again maybe sports event, art gallery or concert, whatever we choose; our stay will be at One King West Hotel",
            "Our recent stay at One King West Hotel was most enjoyable. All the staff from the front desk, room service, cleaners and bar\\u002Frestaurant were friendly and attentive to our needs. They all made you feel very welcome.\\nThe suite had everything that anyone would want and the bed was most comfortable. ever. We found The Teller\\u2019s Bar\\u002FRestaurant had delicious food and attentive service. \\nGreat location. Only a short walk from Union station. Would stay there again in a heartbeat",
            "One King West offered a haven for us to celebrate our special day in great comfort and style. Our valet was prompt enough to take our car and let us in where we were greeted and welcomed with a smile by the concierge staff!\\nI had wanted a special surprise gift for my husband placed im the room before we checked in and they had thoughtfully arranged everything as per request. The room was at the right temperature and very clean. The view was just as expected and we had some delicious Truffle fries brought in on time by room service staff. We then explored the historic vault and other features of the hotel like Austin gallery and the historic elevators etc which was a great way to get to know the value of the hotel we chose to spend our special day in. \\nBreakfast at Daily Ritual was also wonderful where we savoured fresh hot coffee and breakfast sandwiches. We were served complimentary pastries too which was very nice.\\nI would highly recommend One King West to anyone who looka forward to top class stay away from home on any occassion",
            "This unique venue offers everything a large group could possibly need or want and expertly adjusts to assist in making your event memorable. The significant history of the property and grand spaces can accommodate any kind of meeting or gala event. The Fifteen Hundred Suite is absolutely spectacular and makes you feel like a rock star! It serves well for meetings or parties and our group used it for both (day\\u002Fevening). The guestrooms are attractive, modern and clean with spectacular views of the city. The service at One King West is top notch and every request is fulfilled above expectations with the very best prompt, friendly service. The wonderful Sachin is definitely the best Catering\\u002FBanquet Manager I have ever had the pleasure of working with and Conference Service Manager Lynn is fantastic in the planning and overseeing the execution of the event. She is pleasant, professional, frank and honest, which is a winning combination to ensure your event takes place without a hitch!  The food is delicious and the group menus provided variety while accommodating all types of dietary requirements: vegan, dairy-free, gluten-free, kosher... The dinner at our special gala event in the stunning Grand Banking Hall  was nothing short of amazing and everyone was talking about it for weeks afterward. The layout of the meeting areas is a challenge but this small issue did not outweigh the benefits and WOW factor' of this special venue, which I highly recommend",
            "I stayed two nights for my daughter's wedding. The staff here are warm and friendly and always helpful. Right from check-in to check-out, the staff were always smiling and acknowledge me and give me any assistance I need. If you're planning a function, the organizational staff, the Chef and all the catering staff and the facilities are second to none. I was so impressed with the quality of the food and the service we received was first class. If you're just planning a visit to Toronto or a weekend getaway, you will love the suites. They are so beautifully appointed that you won't want to leave. They have million dollar views and having a kitchen right there in your room makes life so much more convenient. Then there's the BED!!! I have never experienced a big, soft, comfy bed like this in my life. I really wanted to take the bed home with me. This place is close to everything, has beautiful facilities and the entire staff from the porter right up to the Manager are helpful and welcoming in every way. I would not hesitate to recommend One King West to all of my friends and family. You won't be disappointed",
            "Booked this stay for one night as we were celebrating our anniversary to watch the Maple Leafs game and wanted to be within walking distance from the venue and have a place we could relax afterwards.\\nVery much wish we could have stayed fore more than one night as the staff and everyone was so accommodating.\\nUpon entering at the side street we were greeted by the valet team (Wonde & Muhammed), they asked us if we need aid with our luggage, we didn't, then proceeded to take care of our vehicle. *If you're from out of town coming in for a game and want to stay for a night I would suggest here as it is worth it for the protected parking garage and walking distance.\\nEntering the lobby I was greeted and assisted by Colin who checked us in and gave us an rundown of when the lobby bar closes etc, and we got free pastries\\u002F coffee vouchers at check in to use at the cafe connected to the hotel, lovely!\\nIf you are claustrophobic or are extremely impatient you \\\"might\\\" have a problem with waiting in an elevator to go to your room IF you are in a higher up room. But the views of the city scape are worth it. \\nAll the rooms are suites, the one we had was in a corner and was basically all windows and the sunset before the game was amazing. The bed was so comfy I didn't want to leave. You can order food from the TV. We came back from the Leafs game and watched tv and just sat in bed with the Toronto city lights surrounding us watching late night sports and eating food ordered from the TV drinking.\\nPEAK comfortable romance. \\nThe next morning we woke up and had free coffee and pastries it was so nice.\\n\\nUpon checkout Ana was really sweet and emailed out receipt to us as I didn't want any paper. It only took like 2 minutes to check out and leave. Amazing.\\nI had forgotten to call ahead to have Valet get my car ready as you should call 15 minutes early but the valet staff were really nice about it and found my car.\\n\\nWish I could go back soon. Too bad I live far",
            "My family of 5 were treated to a royally cool weekend while I attended a conference at MTCC. The staff are exceptionally professional. Traffic was high as there were several wedding guests and the lobby remained sparkling clean. Additional valet parking. The suite included a tub, shower, kitchen and a large balcony to explore the outside view of the city. I will definitely be coming back with family and recommending to friends",
            "I truly don\\u2019t know where to begin. The title speaks for itself. One King West is truly a gem and the most prestigious hotel Toronto has to hold. Located on the intersection of Yonge and King. The view of the city from this hotel is remarkable and unobstructed one that is quite rare in Downtown Toronto. A photographer\\u2019s like myself heaven. This was the 3rd time staying at this hotel. Time and time again the team at One King West truly impresses and goes over and beyond. From the excellent guest service starting from the entrance Mo and Franz from the valet gave quite the friendly, outgoing, helpful assistance. To Anu at guest service providing a seamless and stress free check in experience. Along with the top of the line Covid screening and cleaning standards to make the guest more reassured about the safety of the hotel. Will definitely rebook and stay again",
            "We spent over three weeks at One King West, in a historic superior suite. There is nothing \\\"historic\\\" about the suites, other than that they are in the older part of the hotel and look quite dated. The hallway between the elevators and our room had a bad, musty stink to it. When a manager came to investigate, he agreed that the smell was bad and he would have housekeeping address the problem. However, instead of properly cleaning the carpet and airing out the hallway, all they did was spray a lemon scent to try to disguise the odour. It did not work, and we continued to have to navigate through the stink each day as we walked to our room. The windows in the room were nailed shut, so there was no way to get any fresh air onto the floor at all. Housekeeping was generally poor; the room was not regularly vacuumed; sheets were not regularly changed; the kitchen garbage was not regularly emptied; a clean kitchen towel was not left unless we specifically requested it. The automatic dishwasher did not fully clean the dishes, so we frequently had to scrub them ourselves. Housekeeping often happened very late in the day, and one day they forgot to clean our room at all. Another minor point: the toiletries all look exactly the same, so you have to read the small print on each item to determine whether it is shampoo, conditioner, body wash, or body lotion: this is a nuisance in the shower. Also, there was lots of noise from the hallway and from the streetcars on King Street. If you are looking for a clean, quiet hotel, do not stay at One King West",
            "I recently stayed at One King West, I surprised my partner with an overnight staycation for her birthday. Since it was a special occasion, and since it was my first stay at this hotel, my fingers were crossed that the experience would be good and go smoothly\\u2014but it far exceeded my expectations! \\n\\nI booked their romantic couples getaway package, which includes a cheese plate on arrival; a three-course dinner with a bottle of sparkling wine; and a breakfast. \\n\\nThe dinner in particular was unbelievably good. I'm not sure what I expected\\u2014I misheard the concierge, I thought I had to pick up the dinner from the lobby, and assumed it would be in takeout style boxes? Instead, we arrived to our room to find a formal table setting, and dinner was delivered straight to our room on a trolley, on gorgeous plates with cloches to keep everything warm. The quality and presentation of the food was excellent, the kind of fine dining I'd expect from a first class restaurant. I'd wanted to take her out to dinner for her birthday, but it wasn't possible because of pandemic restrictions\\u2014so this was the perfect alternative! \\n\\nThe room was clean, the view was stunning. The televisions were outfitted with Chromecast, so we were able to use our phones to watch movies via Crave, it was easy to set up. \\n\\nAt every step, the staff were super friendly, and went out of their way to communicate and ensure everything was going well. \\n\\nWe definitely plan to go back for another staycation in the not so distant future",
            "I stayed here for 4 nights recently and thoroughly enjoyed my stay. The rooms are a good size and mine had high ceilings and a kitchenette which made it feel even larger. Despite the many covid precautions in place the staff were welcoming and friendly and willing to provide support in any way they could. I had drinks at the bar and the staff there were wonderful as well. Housekeeping was not available, again due to covid, but anything you needed was brought to your room. I especially appreciated the cool door pulls that you access with your foot... so clever",
            "The lobby gives the impression that you are about to stay in a very beautiful, elegant, luxurious hotel. That's the fa\\u00E7ade. The horror begins when you pile up into the tiny elevators. I have travelled all over Canada and eastern Europe and never have I seen such tiny and uncomfortable elevators. The rooms we got after checking in were nightmarish; nothing like pictures in the advert. They were dark, small, and cold. How were they so cold? We were there in August. The insanely high ceilings give the false sense that the rooms are larger than they actually are. Everything about this \\\"hotel\\\" screams repurposed office building. There is nothing like going on holiday and feeling like you are still at the call center. The office-chic cabinetry in the rooms add to the ever appealing call center atmosphere. But at least it had those huge windows peering out onto beautiful downtown Toronto! No. That was also falsely advertised in the ad. Upon opening the curtains, we discovered that the only \\\"view\\\" we had was of an interior wall and a darkened window. No light could come into our room. If I had to find one redeeming factor of our stay, it would be that the staff at the garage were friendly and professional",
            "This hotel reminds me of Le Square Phillips H\\u00F4tel & Suites in Montreal! It is value priced but has luxurious touches, such as bathroom toiletries made by the amazing Canadian fragrance brand Byredo Bal d'Afrique. Wonderful scent!\\n\\n Unfortunately, the shower stall seal was a little open and the bathroom floor flooded. The carpeting in the room is a little worn.\\nWomen's dry sauna, men's dry sauna, and large coed hot tub (that easily fits 12 people) on the 17th floor were nice amenities, but the locker room itself was pretty abysmal. \\n\\nFront desk staff were excellent. Upon request, they put me in a tower king suite with a partial view of the lake, facing East. Unfortunately because the tower suites vary in size, I ended up with the smallest version, but it was fine for one person. I suspect if you have two people then this particular layout would be too small. The bathroom is tiny!\\n\\nIt was great to have a half-sized fridge, although the freezer was frosted over. The kitchen also has a large microwave, kettle, cutlery, plates, mugs, glassware, wine glasses, can opener, pot, pan, spatula, etc. There is however nowhere to eat. No dining table. So again, if you are just solo, you can eat at the desk. But if there are two people in a tower suite, then you cannot do in-room dining.\\n\\nThere are mirrors everywhere, including a very large full-length mirror near the front door and the world's best magnifying mirror in the bathroom. \\n\\nThe shower head has great pressure and can be changed to a different setting. The bed and bedding are quite comfortable, with feather pillows. There are two bedside tables with a telephone but no clock radio. There is also an armchair, ottoman, and tiny side table. For the life of me, I could not get the casting and streaming to work on the TV from my phone and there were no instructions in the room. I heard front desk mentione room service but there is no menu in the room either.\\n\\nI didn't end up eating or drinking anything in the hotel, and the tap water ran a little bit cloudy but was definitely drinkable. There is a water bottle fountain refill station in the fitness room on the 17th floor if you have your own container.\\n\\nBe sure to go to the basement level to see the vault and to the north side of the hotel to see the wedding venue staircase. It's an old bank, and the details are gorgeous and very photo worthy. Plenty of elevators, so there was never a very long wait. If you are taking TTC there, go up the escalator at the far left of the platform and you will exit right in front of the main entrance to the hotel. To take TTC from the hotel, exit North and you will see the stairs going down into the station immediately outside.\\n\\",
            "I booked the Historic Superior Suite - Interior View for one night as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday. Due to a small error and quick switch of rooms, with an upgrade to a room with a gorgeous view, we had a spectacular time at One King West! \\nThe room was beautiful, it had a separate living area with a couch, a small kitchenette, spacious and clean bathroom, super comfortable bed and a television in each room. The breathtaking view of the city, the lake and the gorgeous CN Tower definitely enhanced our experience in the Historic Superior Suite. \\nWe felt confident to stay at One King West during COVID19 as they did a fantastic job of disinfecting all areas. We noticed staff spraying disinfectant in all the \\u201Cbusy\\u201D areas in and around the lobby. There was also a notice in our room informing us that the entire room has been disinfected. The staff at the lobby also followed protocol, there was a screening process and rules for following social distance within the hotel - this gave us peace of mind. \\nOverall, my boyfriend and I had a lovely time at One King West hotel. Would highly recommend staying here. Our experience was definitely a memorable one and we hope to be back in the future. Thank you to the team at One King West!",
            "I recently had a staycation in a Historic studio suite and I had my misgivings because I encountered a dreary studio in the past (although front desk did give me an upgrade on request). This one, however, was a nice little suite and I really enjoyed my stay. The carpeting on the 14th floor hallways desperately needs  upgrading but that's my only complaint. Aside from running water I didn't hear a peep from my neighbors. What is really awesome about One King West is the customer service. Everybody from reservations, to front desk to the maids and maintenance staff sing from the same customer-pleasing hymn book. Toronto isn't exactly known for it's exceptional customer service, but I could find no fault with these people. Highly recommended, although I would suggest splurging for the Tower",
            "Timeless elegance in a relaxing setting in the city \\nHave heard about OKW for years and was so excited to book a stay there! It lived up to its reputation of being a fine hotel. The views of the city front room were gorgeous, loved having a good space in which to wind down after a day walking around in the city or relaxing by the gorgeous bar in the lobby. The room was ample size, the bed super comfy with luxe linens, the bathroom had nice fixtures, plush towels and top of the line toiletries. We had dinner there and the menu for had a great selection and the prices were very, very reasonable, COVID hygiene kept in perspective and followed through out",
            "I would and do recommend One King West Hotel to anyone who asks. The service is exceptional the facilities are beautiful the rooms have more than you need with a kitchen that allows you to bring in your own food all utensils even a dishwasher. The beds will make you feel like your sleeping on a cloud. The staff goes above and beyond to make your stay perfect. I have stayed here many times this last was when my dad was flown to Toronto for surgery and they made me feel like I was at home. Oh and don\\u2019t forget to sit at the bar or enjoy the food from their restaurant",
            "Staying at One King really is being at the hotel to call home. I really like to notice small things that are indicative of a really well run service establishment. The aspect of One King that really stands out is the continuity of staff. The front desk, the service people, the people I deal with in bookings all have a remarkable degree of continuity. That tells me that One King is a good employer, the staff are genuinely happy to be there and in turn, this relays into a comfortable, welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. Oh, and the location if fantastic, right beside the subway and barely a 10 minute stroll to the Up Train from Pearson, the food and bar service are top notch and next door at the Daily Ritual serves up a delicious sandwich or wrap, soup, coffee or a perfect latte!

            "3 nights for about 1100 CAD.\\n\\nIt is about 30m and 50 dollars from the airport with an uber if there is little traffic.\\n\\nHad a very nice room on the 44th. It was clean; there was a kitchenette with refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, coffee, safe and such. Good wifi. A bit small but decent bathroom with some amenities. Good bed and good AC. Can also crack some windows open.\\n\\nStaff was very friendly at check in.\\n\\nLocation is walking distance (if 30m is not a problem for you) from a lot of sightseeying; cn tower, chinatown, brewing district with a lot of galleries, the mall at dunda and a couple of decent places to eat such as cest what and overeasy.\\n\\nAn inconvenience was that there is noise from the airflows in this room (perhaps not all rooms). There was a draft from under the front door; inwards; so it whistles a bit; dampened it with a towel; something above the microwave was making noise like a kitchen hood but without a button for it (perhaps connected to the light switch) and the AC itself also but at least that\\u2019s functional. Better sleep with earplugs if you are sensitive to such sounds; it grows on you by the day",
            "We were so delighted with our beautiful Suite at One King West. If you are not used to going to Downtown Toronto, it can be a very scary place to drive. The Valet Service took care of the Car and it was just a nice 12 minute walk to the Hospital.\\nWe had to stay for 1 day and a half and they offered us a great rate.\\nBecause of the Lockdown in Toronto, I brought our own food. We were so delighted to find a Mini Kitchenette in our room, and the views from the 36 th Floor were amazing!\\nThe Building is part new part Historic, the old TD and the fixtures were so Beautiful.\\nAnna at the Front Desk was great, but it is impossible to single out the Best Employee because everyone that we dealt with was amazing and genuinely concerned about making our short stay the best it could be under the circumstances. There is a Huge Vault down the Staricase in the Lobby, although closed to walk into at this time, you can see the Massive Door, and enter the Path right from the Lobby. Stores were closed and not many people around, but we really enjoyed walking and exploring underground. There were some Cafes open and take out food places, but not many.\\nA great location when having to stay in the City, we Highly recommend this Hotel and gladly give it 5 Stars for Comfort, Sleep, conveniences, excellent Staff, and everything about it",
            "In the midst of COVID, this was an excellent stay. Loved the tower suite, very comfortable bed, amazing views of the lake and the city. It was a 3 night stay in the heart of an almost deserted downtown but have nothing but good things to say. Garbage was easily disposed of just down the corridor. Staff kept in constant contact via text and check out was efficient and easy - just drop your card in a basket and wave!  Absolutely will stay here again",
            "Two night weekend stay in older 12 floor ex bank building, our room was a corner king on 7th floor with good city veiws.\\nMaybe this hotel is a bit of a event place as it was so busy . On the Saturday night the suite next door seemed to be hosting a party with 10+ people in and out their room,  so much noise security came up at 11pm ,noise calmed down till 3 am then started up again. These guests had no regard for other guests spending hard earned money on a weekend break. Pretty despicable people hop their parents are proud!!.\\nSunday night hotel was totally peaceful.\\nHotel is very central on the edge of the financial district and connected to the PATH tunnel system , 10 min walk to Union station or Eaton centre. \\nHotel is clean and tidy but showing wear and tear in places but would stay again for location alone.\\",
            "We were greeted with friendly faces and a beautiful clean room. I would receive text messages checking in and informing us of meals options in the hotel and hours they were available. We had an historic suite on the 9th floor. We were very pleased with the location in proximity to all of the things we wanted to explore. And it was in direct access to PAT",
            "My husband and I recently stayed for the second time at One King West, we travelled in from out of town for a nights stay. We had stayed once previously and had been impressed by the spacious suites and water\\u002Fcity views. When we checked in this time, we had a room that was less impressive, no view and quite dark. I immediately called guest services and despite being busy with a wedding, we were immediately resituated in a far superior room, with some of the most impressive views and amenities. The staff are always so welcoming and so helpful. We always enjoy our stay, complete with in-room dining that offers delicious food, and recommend One King West to anyone looking to get away",
            "Came here late at night after having a horrible time with another place that was extremely sketchy. Had absolutely amazing service from all the employees who went out of their way to help give us a comfortable stay, and did their best to tell us all the best spots to check out and enjoy. Room service was on time and was so good to enjoy with the amazing view of Toronto that we had. Amazing location downtown with easy access to subway, streetcars and many great food places and shops nearby to explore. Another great thing about the location was that is was an easy drive to the gardiner expressway so there wasn\\u2019t any difficult downtown driving to do. All in all it was an amazing experience that went above and beyond my expectations from the service and food to location and the views. Super excited to visit again next time i come to stay in Toronto",
            "This hotel could use some TLC. We reserved a suite. We were given a room on the 30th floor. The views were spectacular especially at night. Our room consisted of a separate bedroom with a kitchenette, bathroom and sitting area. The room had generous windows, and a corner in the bedroom, which had a glorious view. However, there are some things that need to be improved. First and foremost, the bathroom needs to be redone. The towels were overly worn and rough and need to be replaced. Additionally, only two bath towels were left each morning when cleaning the room. I had to request additional towels every day we were there. The housekeeping did not replace glasses and did not do a thorough cleaning job. We stayed five nights so we were here long enough to be able to accurately access the cleaning. The interior was definitely done in an IKEA fashion and we truly didn\\u2019t understand why there was so much room dedicated to the kitchenette area which we didn\\u2019t use anyway.   \\nThe staff was friendly and helpful, especially the concierge. They recommended a Niagara Falls tour that was fantastic, and they actually picked us up at the hotel. \\nOverall, I would say that this is a good hotel, but it\\u2019s certainly not what we are used to since we usually stay in luxury hotels. I believe, looking at other prices of hotels this hotel was a good value for the price, but we were disappointed on the low quality of the furniture in the room",
            "My experience at 1KW is always satisfactory. Check-in is easy and fast, with hotel staff are always willing to go up and beyond for their guest. Everyone is nice and friendly! On our previous stay we had an issue with the room and I remember the concierge telling us it was no problem and that we\\u2019d be relocated to a new room. The new room was a Tower Suite!! The view of the city was incredible! The upgrade was amazing and we weren\\u2019t charged extra. \\n\\nDuring our current stay we were in a Historic Suite and the layout was different based on the previous Historic Suites we\\u2019ve stayed in while at the hotel. The arrangement was really cool and the room was very clean. Upon check-in we were greeted by a friendly guest service representative, Justine who even remembered us from our last stay a couple of months ago! \\n\\nOverall I have nothing bad to say about 1KW. The hotel is fancy and I always feel welcome. Every time we stay here we discover something new and interesting about the hotel. \\n\\nFor instance, the path connects right to the hotel so you can exit the subway and go through a corridor straight to the hotel without having to go outside. A blessing especially in the winter time. \\n\\nOverall it\\u2019s such a beautiful space! 1KW has set such a high standard that whenever we stay elsewhere it just doesn\\u2019t feel the same. Whenever we are booking downtown 1KW is always my top choice! Highly recommend booking here. Keep up the great work 1KW team!! :",
            "I've stayed at One King twice this year. I orginally booked because the price was reasonable and the location was great. After staying there in April I returned because I was so impressed with the hotel. It is very well kept and clean. Both of my rooms had great views of the CN tower and city.  The beds are comfortable, more on the firm side, which I prefer.  I bought food and used the kitchenette every day for breakfast. Front desk and the bell staff are courteous and attentive. I found all the staff, regardless of if they were helping me, to be exceptionally kind.  Whenever I was in the elevator with someone they would smile, greet me and strike up a conversation. The location is a short walk to the arena, train station, and there are so many great restaurants within minutes of the hotel. I loved going to the Daily Ritual Cafe (which is attached to the hotel)  in the morning, grabbing a coffee and walking around the corner to Berczy park to people watching.  Overall it's just solid hotel with great staff. I look forward to my next stay",

The Distillery Historic District and Casa Loma are notable landmarks, and if you love to do shopping you may want to visit CF Toronto Eaton Centre and Yorkdale Shopping Centre, and also Winners very affordable stuff..\\nStayed for 3nights and our room located at 13F decent size, comfy bed, equipped with oven ,stove,kettle and coffee machine with Starbucks drip coffee \\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83C\\uDFFB\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83C\\uDFFB\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83C\\uDFFB and toilet is pretty good size as well good for a couple staying for couple of days to explore Toronto ( including shampoo, body wash,lotion, mouthwash ) just bring your own toothbrush & toothpaste \\uD83D\\uDE04\\nAnd a flat screen tv, a coffee table and sofa ..\\nWith a competitive price I could say,\\nWe didn\\u2019t try the bar but looks pretty good , every time we came back to the hotel the bar is always fully packed ..\\nWe had a great stay with a amazing front staff ..\\nHighly recommended \\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83C\\uDFFB\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83C\\uDFFB\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83C\\uDFF",
            "The suite I stayed in was wonderful. I enjoyed having so much space to move around, along with the separate sleeping area. I was amazed with all the extra accomodations in the room, including the washer and dryer, dishwasher, and stove. Despite having such a large room, it was very clean and the housekeeping staff did a tremendous job during my stay. I also liked that the room was not too noisy, even with the hotel being right on the corner of Yonge and King in the heart of Downtown Toronto. The location is perfect and easy to get around the city by TTC (the streetcar and subway stop right by the hotel, and Union Station is only a short distance away), or by foot (the PATH is also adjacent to the hotel). Teller's Bar and Bistro and the adjacent Daily Ritual Cafe serve great food, and the staff was always friendly and helpful",
            "It was my Girlfriend's Birthday but Ontario went into complete lockdown yet again. so I booked a Tower Deluxe room and requested One King West to give us one of the best views from hotel room so that the lockdown does not come in the way of making her happy. To my surprise upon Check-In we were upgraded to Tower Premium for free. This was the best gesture from the management. I had one more request to sneak the amenity in our room with a card while we were out and they did it perfectly well. This surely made our day one of the most memorable ones.\\nAlso they took utmost care of COVID-19 rules and regulations.\\nIt was indeed one of the best stays with the best view of Downtown Toronto",
            "I spent a weekend in Toronto and One King West was the best fit. \\nIt is conveniently located being equidistant from the harbour and one the biggest malls within a walkable distance\\nI would like to specifically thank Ana at the front desk for the warm hospitality. The check-in was seamless and rooms were absolutely clean with a spectacular view of the city and the CN tower\\nThe Smoked Old fashioned signature drink at the bar in the lobby is just what you would need to get your everything started!!\\nIt was an amazing stay at the beautiful property and I can\\u2019t wait to be back \\nThank you One King West team for a comfortable and memorable stay:",
            "First, let me say that this hotel was exactly what we needed!  From the first gentleman \\\"Elfeden\\\" that met us outside to direct where we would leave our vehicle in his capable hands to the maid staff, everyone went out of their way to be sure we were enjoying our stay.  The hotel is on The Path so we had underground access to every building and over 1200 restaurants without going outside in the cold.  The Eaton Shopping Center is just north of the hotel and accessible via the path.  The rooms are condos.  Ours had a small kitchenette that made having leftovers and snacks very easy in the room.  The views were spectacular, we were on the 26th floor and the lake shimmered for us daily.  The beds are comfortable, the living room made the perfect cribbage parlor.  We had champagne in the room.  We brought champagne glasses from home, the maids hand washed them and they were always ready for the next bottle.   We had not even asked them to wash the glasses for us.  That is extra service!  We were treated like celebrities!  Elf lit up every time we saw him as we exited the lobby and greeted us like old friends",
            "I come here every time I stay downtown; its located a quick 5 mins Uber from everywhere and everything you could want to visit, amazing for nightlife, and is incredibly convenient to get around. All of the best bars, club, and parties happen on king, and is just half an intersection away from union, linking you anywhere in the GTA. The price is incredibly affordable for gorgeous views of the city, beautiful rooms, and great amenities. The staff are always incredibly helpful, friendly, and accommodating, with option for early check in and late checkout should you need it. I always recommend this spot to everyone looking to stay in Toronto",
            "Needed to stay in downtown Toronto for one night and chose One King West based on its convenient location.  From the time I made my same-day reservation all the way through check-in and check-out I was impressed.  It's always nice to see a historic building preserved and they have done a great job.  It's a beautiful building.  My hotel room was on the 40th floor and i had a spectacular view of Lake Ontario.  My room was equipped with a small kitchenette should I have been interested in preparing small meals.  No complaints about the room.  It was perfect",
            "After checking out different venues on Trip Advisor, we chose One King West Hotel & Residence. This hotel is centrally located , has a nice lobby and restaurant. The room was very spacious with a small living room and two televisions all in the same space. The bed was comfortable and bathroom adequate.\\nThere was two slit windows with no view whatsoever, so we had to keep the lights on during the day. Let\\u2019s say that we were not used to that and it was not mentioned in the description as we chose the junior suite.\\nThe kitchen was adequate but severely lacking in utensils for cooking breakfast, we had to request a toaster. We have been in several hotels with kitchenette and they were well equipped to at least have some eggs and toasts, along with condiments.\\nThere is a small shop downstairs with sandwiches and good coffee.\\nThe restaurant downstairs is good with casual fare and good service.all COVID protocol were respected. We liked the hotel overall and would probably return if we go back to Toronto",
            "Beautiful hotel. Suites with kitchenettes are well laid out and stocked with basic items. Rachel Smalls and Ana at reception were generously accommodating during check-in. Texting app service was helpful and informative of details pertinent to our stay",
            "We have stayed here a number of times. Great location in the downtown area. An easy walk from the train station and a subway station is right outside the door. Rooms clean and modern and equipped with kitchenettes. We have enjoyed our stay each time we have been there. The last two times we got a free upgrade to a one-bedroom suite on high floor in tower. In the off-season\\u002Fwinter, the rates are very reasonable - king room with kitchenette for $230 CAD. It is much more expensive in the summer. Staff are very friendly",
            "Highly recommended when in Toronto . Well located downtown you can walk to everywhere. Rooms were clean with a kitchenette (we had a tower suite on the 39th floor) we even asked for a toaster. The bed and pillows\\u002F sheet were very very comfortable. The bathroom is a bit small compared to the big room but we didnt care. The only downside is that the valet parking is very expensive but we found \\u00E0 parking nearby which was less expensive. We will be back next time with no h\\u00E9sitation",
            "We live in Toronto but wanted a quick and relaxing staycation in the city and our stay at One King West provided that exactly! Very friendly and helpful staff and well-managed from a COVID perspective as well. The location was perfect for us as we could walk to all of our favorite restaurants and coffee shops in the city. That said, the lounge in the hotel has an great vibe in the evenings if you want to have a drink or grab a bite to eat. The rooms were in pristine condition and the view from our suite in particular was spectacular. We had a 360 degree view from our suite right from the living room, bedroom to even the lavish bathtub in the bathroom. Overall, it was fantastic stay and we would love to visit again",
            "From the Reception to the maids, all I received was professional kindness. The Downtown location made it easy for me to walk to the Bay area and experience all that downtown Toronto has to offer. The amenities in the room were astounding - washers, dryers and 2 TVs! The bed was extremely comfortable and I loved being able to use the sauna and hot tub. It reminded me of being on a cruise ship! Being solo, I didn't really need to be dining fancy, so was very happy that both Starbucks and Hero Hamburgers were across the street and I could eat happily in my room on the crockery and cutlery provided. The coffee provided in the room was just okay but better than most",
            "Amazing hotel. Large spacious rooms, very clean and quiet. Honestly, the room has everything needed for a home away from home! Fully stocked kitchenette, complete with dishwasher to a washer\\u002Fdryer combo machine! I would definitely recommend this hotel to others and you can bet we'll stay here again when in town! A 5 star hotel in my opinion",
            "I live in Toronto, but I decided to spend three nights at One King just to get out of my apartment. I chose a room in the historical part of building, but was upgraded to a 32nd floor tower room on arrival. Considering the circumstances, I felt very safe at the front desk and with all the precautions that the hotel implemented, such as no room service or maintenance during my stay. The room was clean, had very large windows overlooking the city, and was well-equipped with a cooktop, microwave, dishwasher, coffee maker with coffee and tea, and various utensils, cups, glasses and plates. The WiFi was very reliable, and the king-size bed was perfectly comfortable. There was a shower stall in the washroom, which I prefer to a bathtub, so it was perfect for me. There is a restaurant that provides takeout; you can order and pick up your food downstairs. However, I chose to use some of the many interesting restaurants within walking distance that I was familiar with and where you can order takeout online and just drop by to pick it up: Richmond Station, Kupfert & Kim, Sukhothai, and Terroni. You can also get snacks at the Shoppers Drug Mart across the street. One King gave me a welcome respite from my usual locked down life. I highly recommend it to fellow Ontarians and Torontonians, especially now, when rates are considerably more reasonable than usual",
            "I stayed in the 39th floor, the room was small, it had a kitchen, city view, good cleaning. Comfortable bed, nice desk and chair, there was a single sofa next to the window. The air conditioning was quite noisy but if you turn it off you can hear the neighbours conversation so it was better to\\nhave it on. Elevators are a bit slow. The entrance is nice but a bit messy at night because of the dinner services and the live singer. Overall, the price is ok for the location.",
            "I was surprised to see the room comes with a kitchenette equipped with numerous plates, cups, and cutlery, with a washing machine and dishwasher! Nice view of the city, great location (close to union station and eaton centre), and really warm and welcoming staff. I was greeted and helped by Muhammad and Wonde on valet service, and Joana at front desk was the best at checking us in. The most memorable stay I've had so far"

            "Mediocre at best. I was impressed with the lobby, very clean and modern. I booked the \\\"Luxury King Suite\\\"  which was quoted to have \\\"granite countertops\\\" along with a photo of a lovely suite with an island and dining table. When I unlocked my room, this was not at all what I was given. We had a kitchen with stainless appliances that looked very new - but plain countertops and no island or kitchen table. We had a couch & chair with a marble coffee table along with a TV. They have very clearly tried hard to update the rooms with modern furnishings but have forgotten to update the actual space. The flooring was old & paint stained. The 90s mirrored closet doors don't close properly. The bathroom was very old and the square tiled flooring was stained and nothing was updated but the lighted mirror. The room was clean and all the kitchen appliances etc were present. The bed was very comfy as well. Unfortunately, this room just wasn't what I was expecting to walk into, given the description and photos on the emails\\u002Fwebsite. Overall it was fine for the price I paid for Toronto, I was just disappointed to walk into a very institutional-like room. No paint, art, or wallpaper. Just stark white with no decor. I should add the check-in staff were wonderful! I did not complain or bring my concerns to the front desk because that's just not who I am. I just don't want anyone else to be let down by what is promised vs what they receive",
            "Whole place needs revamping. Rooms are very very tired and in need of renovation.\\n\\nWas on 12th floor, seems a lot of rooms were same as ours after talking to other guests... Things like air con not working correctly\\u002Frunning loud, windows hardly opening, mattress really worn, door to room broken.\\n\\nRoom was large and location decent, close to bloor\\u002FYonge metro\\n\\nWas there 4 days and didn't get any room service\\u002Ftowels changed (may be standard practice).\\n\\nStaff friendly enough, not their fault.\\n\\nWould avoid in future, unless very cheap rate",
            "We needed a hotel room large enough for 5 women on a \\\"girls night out\\\" and this place fit the bill. We enjoyed the comfort of the two bedroom suite which allowed for a night of card playing, socializing, and cooking h'orderves after we took in a play and had dinner out. It added to our Toronto experience !!!",
            "We booked this hotel at the last minute, which is not normal for us but we had some circumstances that made it necessary.  This is the most we've ever paid for a room. $290 per night Canadian,  There were plenty of great things about the hotel, especially the location that was convenient to Toronto's wonderful public transportation system and good walking as well.  There were supermarkets nearby.  The desk staff were friendly and I appreciated that they wore masks.  It was handy to have a kitchenette in the room and the bed was notably comfortable.  Trips of 5 nights or more came with a free airport pickup, which worked as planned.  The shower was good with plenty of hot water.  I liked that they had recycling in the room.\\n\\nWe often stay at low budget hotels, and this place was less clean than most.  Attached are some photos of just a sample of the stains and food that were smeared on the wall when we checked in.  There was a weird stinginess about the place.  For example, the room came with a dishwasher and we stayed 5 nights, but they only provided us with 2 dishwashing detergent tabs.  There was also a coffeemaker, but for two of us they provides a total of 4 coffee pods.  The room was serviced once during our 5 days, which was okay if they had let us know but it was strange they didn't tell us and we started to get overflowing trash.  There are some cooking implements but no hand dish soap, salt, etc.  We bought a bunch of breakfast food when we arrived because their website said breakfast was discontinued due to Covid, but when we left the first morning we saw that they were serving breakfast.  They have one instant coffee machine that folks were lining up for, with pastries, apples and yogurt.  The balcony looked inviting but was locked for unexplained reasons",
            "Nice location, walking distance to street cars, restaurants. Staff were friendly. They are very welcoming at the reception, unlike at the hotel we went for an overnight stay in Montreal. Didn\\u2019t expected the complimentary breakfast which is nice and not in a bag. Fresh croissants. Amenities in our room is good",
            "My wife and I spent 5 nights here. The location was close to the gay village neighbourhood and high-end Yorkville Ave. We were able to walk to most things we wanted to explore. \\n\\nThe hotel room was a cute, cozy, and clean apartment. We had a full kitchen, living space, bedroom, and bathroom with a rainfall shower. It was everything we needed to have a relaxing space to enjoy after a long day of exploring. \\n\\nWe only used housekeeping once since we were only there a few days. If we requested clean towels or toilet paper from the front desk it was brought up in less than 5 minutes. \\n\\nA classic continental breakfast of muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit was provided each morning. \\n\\nWe stayed in a \\u201Cluxury king suite, one bedroom\\u201D booked through Hotels. ca and the room was wonderful. I\\u2019d stay here again",
            "The place is excellent. Great location. Very clean and wide accommodation.Staffs were very welcoming. It will always be my home away home in Toronto. Parking was clean and safe. I didn\\u2019t mind to pay for the parking because it was reasonable. But it could be awesome if it were free",
            "Clean, comfortable and practical accommodation, just as shown in the photograph. Personable check-in staff. We enjoyed a quiet night's sleep. Suite was well-equipped with fridge, stove, toaster, dishes, dishwasher, etc. for eating in. Good space in our suite for sitting together with friends who stayed in an adjacent suite. I would not hesitate to choose Town Inn Suites in future",
            "Recently stayed here with some friends.  Stayed in 2 bedroom suite. Upon arriving entered hotel lobby which was decorated beautifully recently renovated. Staff was very informative and detailed. On what hotel offered. Hotel offers complimentary breakfast from 7am again lounge is nicely decorated and updated. Has a pool and sauna for your personal use.   Hotel is in an amazing location close to all attractions and walking location to shops. Hotel staff was very helpful Assisting with our needs. Room was modern and nicely decorated. Only thing about this hotel is there is a $1000 deposit required for stay even though we  only spending one night. However due to the hotel amenities inside the room fridge stove microwave and newly update could understand why. When booking wanting great location and feeling the comforts of home away from home this is a great place to stay",
            "We had a really excellent stay. The room was clean. The hotel manager and his staff are so friendly and efficient - they are like a family. Excellent location downtown. Everything you will need is in the apartment and the kitchen is fully equipped. The Wifi is fast and reliable. Would definitely recommend this place",
            "Stayed here for 5 days. The staff are extremely  helpful and efficient and have a professional  style. We were upgraded to a lovely apartment before we left Australia  perhaps  because  we mentioned  that we were on our honeymoon!! Jun couldn't  do enough for us with emails back and forth, prior to us beginning  our trip across  Canada. The Deluxe King Suite was lovely..even has a kettle!!! Kitchen is very modern with good appliances  and full size oven and stove top. Large microwave oven, and very large stainless steel  fridge. The only minus was the free breakfast.  Very basis choices indeed..\\nThere is a decent grocery store at the corner of the next block, which is a few minutes  walk ( a convenience  store is directly across from the hotel) (didn't go to that one). A hairdressing  salon is just around the corner and Croissant  Tree restaurant  is diagonally  opposite.  This eatery is great for any time of the day meals or snacks. Very cheap quality food in a nice setting.. There is a coin laundry in the hotel and an indoor pool. Dog friendly  too. Definitely  would recommend this  hotel",
            "Had to review! Stayed twice in 1 week, seeing 2 rooms, 1 with kitchen and 1 without. Both were perfectly clean, spacious, well decorated and comfortable.  The staff was very helpful; you got the impression, they all wanted to make sure your stay was the best it could be. Parking ($30 per night) was a little pricey, but easy to use and very convenient, appreciated. The atmosphere on colourful Church street and the convention shops surrounding the hotel greatly added to our seamless, stress free stay. You\\u2019ll definitely feel safe.  Across the street and south 100m is a great coffee shop in the morning and a pub in the evening, providing a perfect start and end to your day.  Do not hesitate to stay at this hotel, period",
            "I had stayed at this hotel years ago, and I was aware that hotel had gone through renovations but did not know what to expect..  When I booked room originally there wasn't two double beds room available online.  When I checked I asked if one was available, the manager quickly looked into it, and was able to give me a suite, at nominal increase in price.  When I walked in the room I was totally surprised how beautiful it was.  It was very modern, clean, and comfortable, the suite was very large.  It had stove, microwave, dishwasher, where I made good use of the appliances, during my 4 day stay.  The cleaning staff was a very sweet lady, and accommodated me with towels, toiletry, dish washer detergent, etc, I had told her it was ok not to make beds etc, I would take care of it. The location is great spot, close to many amenities, restaurants, shopping, few blocks away from Bloor St.  Wi Fi was free, and used it a lot for work and leisure. I was pleasantly surprised of this hotel and will plan to visit there again",
            "The Place is close to Downtown.  This neighborhood is known as \\u201Cgay Village\\u201D.  It\\u2019s not a problem for us, but some may don\\u2019t like.  People from the hotel were very nice.  In fact, our suite was a huge apartment complete, with 2 bed rooms, kitchen And 1 bathroom.   No breakfast.   Ideal for familys and thouse who travel in small groups",
            "This was my first time at town inn and everything was amazing. I was missing a pot in the kitchen, and I called front desk and they were very quick with bringing one straight to my room. Over all amazing experience and everything was clean. I will for sure be booking again",
            "When we arrived we were surprised as the pictures on the website are very deceiving.\\nPeeling wallpaper, drywall, mould in the bathroom along with a few pubic hairs, the vent fan was filled with hanging lint and did not work and  hundreds of dead bugs in the light fixture above the dining table.\\nMaintenance had to come and replace our kitchen table, and open windows by pushing them out because the cranks were all broken.\\nWe had to go to the dollar store to buy utensil even after housekeeping brought more cutlery. The Keurig leaks so had to put it on a tea towel, which we had to ask for since there was no tea towels or dis soap to wash dishes.\\nWe called to have our garbage removed after the second day and we were told to bring it to a garbage chute ourselves.\\nWe will never be back. We\\u2019ve taken pictures of notes to the manager who just didn\\u2019t seem to care about our concerns",
            "Fantastic place as your close to where you want to be.  After travel in 3 time zones from Hawaii, Houston and Toronto in one week this apartment hotel is a great place. When I do come back to Toronto this will be the spot to come to from now on as you have everything you need and food stores are a few blocks down the street.\\nI recommend staying at Town INN Suites when you visit Toronto",
            "The main advantage of this suite hotel is its Yorkville location near downtown Toronto and various amenities.   Our suite was spacious and clean but there were significant maintenance problems that made (especially the bathroom) very unappealing (e.g., bubbled up paint, wall paper peeling, cracked tiles, rusted bathtub drain); I will post some photos.  The suite did not have a safe for the storage of valuables and we were not given access to a fitness center (having been told that it is \\u201Conly open for personal training now\\u201D). Most staff were not wearing masks but were helpful.  The main problem was the poor maintenance (see photos)",
            "At first we thought this place was a bit out of the way and we should have stayed at the waterfront.  Well actually Church Street was the right choice, located on Church between Wellesley and Bloor\\u002F Yonge on the subway it was actually a really good location.\\n\\nWent for the bigger apartment (which we probably didn\\u2019t need) and appreciated the space.  Though a little tired the place was clean and well run.  Really comfy bed.  Perhaps a better range of TV channels for non Canadian visitors.  I wouldn\\u2019t have minded if they were in English or French, just a bit more choice.\\n\\nBreakfast is why I have marked the star rating down.  Breakfast is served in a small room that would seat probably a dozen people.  The food doesn\\u2019t vary and if staying for more than two days you are likely to tire of it.  Let\\u2019s just say it\\u2019s an interpretation of a continental breakfast.  But that\\u2019s not why you are in Toronto. Right?  There are plenty of places nearby to get breakfast, but that\\u2019s a pain to feel that you need to, having the cost already in your price.  It\\u2019s probably a better idea to grab breakfast, head to the lift and have it in your room, especially at busy times",
            "Great hotel for a family with plenty of space to keep everyone happy.  Fully equipped kitchen which we used mainly for the fridge, has dishes and cutlery, as well as a corkscrew.\\n\\nHousekeeping daily for new towels, emptied trash, and made beds.\\n\\nBreakfast is limited, but you can bring back to the room",
            "I was a participant in a conference in Toronto, near Church and Bloor Streets, and the conference chose this hotel, since it's nearby.  I was favourably impressed.  I don't understand the very negative reviews, and I think there may be an agenda behind some of them.  I do understand the mildly critical reviews; yes, the property is aging and the decor isn't bright and fresh.  I can also see how some might find the neighbourhood a bit sketchy, especially with current construction, though some Torontonians find it rather trendy.  But I liked the large rooms, open space, well equipped kitchen, comfortable bed, and well functioning plumbing in the bathroom.  There's nothing like room service, which I almost never use anyway.  But against that is the low price by Toronto standards.  At the front desk I got delayed a bit by what was described as a misunderstanding between the conference organizer and the hotel, though I think the misunderstanding was on the hotel's side.  The staff was friendly about it though",
            "Needed a simple room and got a nicely equipped suite. Very surprised when we walked into a suite that cost less than half of a single room. Heart of Toronto, walking distance to almost everything and yet quiet at night. Staff was amazing and very helpful.",
            "Went to spend a week-end In Toronto and came across this fabulous place, booked on line. The front staff service was amazing , very happy and welcoming staff. Our room was beautiful, King size bed with Fully equipped Kitchen , living room. Our room was very clean ,everything we needed was there, such an amazing place , parking is on premises , and breakfast offered is across the street. The pool was not opened at this time, understanding, but look forward to our next visit. amazin",
            "We had a very nice stay, building is old but beautiful, room super cozy, bed was amazing, super comfortable, great location, either if you love to walk or use public transportation, really liked it. The view from the 23rd floor is wonderful.... this picture was in our last morning",
            "We booked a \\u201Cluxury suite.\\u201D  While it was spacious and had large windows, there was nothing luxurious about it. The place screamed \\u201Cdeferred maintenance.\\u201D  Furniture was old, tired, and uncomfortable. Extensive water damage in the bathroom. What was described as granite countertops were plastic. Everything about this suite screams \\u201Ccheap\\u201D from the poor quality flooring to the tiny televisions. To make matters worse, the hotel has no gym, which I consider unacceptable in 2024. There is actually a gym in the building but the hotel has no arrangement for guests to use it. I am really regretting booking at this place",
            "An absolutely wonderful location, just off the shopping on Bloor Street and a short walk from UofT. \\nRooms are spacious and somewhat functional but with all necessary amenities.

            "We booked a suite here for a 4 day stay in Toronto. The suite was fairly spacious, but in our suite there was not so much as even a small refrigerator or a coffee maker. There was a balcony that was locked, so no way to access it.  The bathroom would have been good, but there was only one towel rack in the whole place. The rooms seemed cold and needed something to warm them up, such as throw pillows.   Breakfast was short and sparse. It ended at 9 AM. I got there at 8:50 to an empty coffee pot. I asked the attendant to bring more coffee. She smiled and said, That's It for coffee for the day. Unbelievable! What kind of hospitality it that? The breakfast room was tiny, not even close to big enough for a hotel this size. In short, I found this hotel to have lots of potential, but very little of it was realized. They need to up their game",
            "I've been to various downtown hotels over the years and the rooms are often very small. I really enjoyed this condo-like \\\"suite\\\". Mine had a small kitchen as well as a living room area. Note that the hotel has different types of rooms.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the stay. I also found the bed to be very comfortable. The living room was nicely arranged. Really had an excellent time and would have happily stayed longer",
            "I have nothing but great things to say about this place and those working here. I was a little apprehensive at first when I checked in Sept 2021 for a month as I am currently a resident of Toronto, in transition to moving to another city in Canada. But this hotel really feels like my own apartment; Neat and clean, organised and located in the heart of downtown Toronto. Check in was smooth. Also the photos online are the same as that of the suite; brand new appliances and furnishing. The staff here from front office to cleaning to maintenance, everyone is nice, courteous, friendly and quick to respond especially the Office Manager Vishal Mistry. I am quite impressed by his exceptional client service. As I was happy with my first month stay that I ended up extending for Oct as well. My big Thank you to Town Inn Group for making my stay pleasant and memorable.\\nBest wishes  \\nWill see you again :",
            "We come with a group of 20+ people. The prices are really fair for the rooms we got. Spacious living room with a lot of facilities such as dish washer. Though it's a pity the balcony could not be accessed. Pool and gyms are closed due to the Covid. The staff were super helpful with the recommendations and even helped us to find agencies to book some trips. The service was fast when we needed something. Great location as well,  the street behind the hotel has a lot of restaurants and bars. Close to Eaton Centre",
            "Very comfortable accomodation to explore Toronto and not to far to Niagara falls! Cooking & washing facilities! There is even breakfast available! A lot of restaurants & shops nearby and the Subway station is only 5 min to go! Very friendly & helbful staff",
            "I stayed in a suite here for 2 weeks while looking for somewhere permanent to rent. My suite was perfectly fine, not high end luxury but not budget either. It had quite a large kitchen and living space, a bathroom (with a shower but not a bath), and a separate bedroom. I wasn't here on holiday so it was nice to have some form of kitchen to cook with. The kitchen had most things you would need.\\n\\nThe bedroom was a little on the small side, partly because there was a huge king sized bed and not much room for anything else. The bathroom was nice, but I had some problems with the hot water in that I had to leave the shower running for 30 minutes sometimes before it got to a reasonable temperature to shower in. Since moving into a condo in Toronto I have the same problem, so I wonder if it's a common thing here.\\n\\nThe wifi was a little slow but functional. I had to sign in again every 24 hours which got irritating given I was there 2 weeks.\\n\\nI stayed here during the COVID-19 pandemic and I was self isolating here after arriving in Canada. The staff were mostly accommodating of this. The only issue I had was requests getting misinterpreted when calling down to reception for something, usually ending up in them bringing the wrong thing or too much of something which was wasteful. Because of the circumstances during my stay, the location made little difference. But if I were getting about, I think I might have found the location a little too far away from the centre",
            "Great central location, close to food, shopping. Overall good value for money, and recently renovated apartment suites. Front desk staff are friendly and professional. Underground parking is a bit pricey so suggest checking other nearby garages. \\n\\",
            "I recently stayed at the Town Inn Suites and was pleasantly surprised. It is centrally located to downtown and the subway. It is very walkable. There are rental bikes nearby if you was to bike around the city. The suites are large with a separate bedroom and kitchen. The rooms are clean. The continental breakfast is basic. I will stay here again if my travels bring me back to Toronto",
            "Nice clean well equit rooms.  In ideal location for exploring Toronto near to a subway station. Staff friendly and helpful.\\nThe only issue was with breakfast as the room was tiny so had to take food back to the apartment to eat. Also only opened till 9am for breakfast felt this should have been longe",
            "I booked this hotel because others in the Yorkville Areo were extremely expensive. While the outside of this hotel doesn\\u2019t look exciting, I was very pleasantly surprised at the inside of the room. It looks like a chic simple New York City modern apartment.\\n\\nOnly con is the breakfast situation - at peak time (730ish - 830), forget about getting in there peacefully.  Better to go out on the streets for a pastry.   \\n\\nLocation is amazing.  Staff friendly",
            "Location is fantastic, 5 minutes from bloor  and yonge and subway. The appartements are fully renovated with full kitchen. The staff is uber friendly and helpfull. The hotel is very clean and well maintained. Too bad that they are getting rid of the pool to build a gym. Good value",
            "One of the best hotels I've stayed at. The Aircondition worked, so many kitchen appliances, the room was spacious, the bed was big and locations was okay with nearby A&W and other restaurants. We didn't bother with the breakfast anymore hehe",
            "Always clean. Employees always ready to accomodate clients.\\nRooms clean. With the kitchenette, really practical. We recommand.\\nWe book sometimes last minute and they have rooms. With or without kitchenette",
            "This was an excellent choice for my wife to rest after minor surgery. Newly renovations full kitchen clean great service. Great deal.  l will be back. Convenient location to access DVP and shops in Yorkville.",
            "It's not the nicest hotel in Toronto but it checks off all the boxes in terms of everything you'd need from a hotel. Rooms are big with a kitchen, although I didn't use it. There was also a free breakfast, which didn't have a ton of options, but helps with a quick start to the day. The staff are great and I'd probably come back",
            "Great location in Toronto. We stayed in a two bedroom suite with kitchen. The kitchen diner was great with loads of space and air conditioning however the rest of the apartment was tired @nd needed updating. No access to the balcony and a tiny windowless bathroom. No air conditioning anywhere except in the kitchen diner. Continental breakfast was limited in variety. Lots of space and facilities for a group of five however I would not stay here again unless all areas were update",
            "My family and I, including 2 cats,  had to find an affordable place to stay while we were putting our condo on the market to sell. The location had to have a full kitchen and enough space for us all and more importantly would allow flexibility on the duration and of course accept pets.  Town Inn Suites was just the spot in the city. Super friendly, kind and professional staff, amazing location, clean and very diligent when it came to bring us items we needed",
            "I was looking for a place that had a kitchen, and so this hotel provided a great full kitchen. But the suite was extremely bland, with laminate floors, plain walls, and Ikea-style furnishings. No personality at all. The room was large but I would have gladly given up half the space for an ounce of elegance and aesthetic appeal. The old-fashioned heating unit never got the room temperature above 19 degrees and so I had to get a space heater in order to bring the room to a comfortable temperature. Despite the website saying that the hotel had been renovated, the bathroom was the style of a Motel 6. The bathtub was strongly stained, giving it a very shabby appearance. There was no hook to hang bath towels. On the plus side, the parkade was very convenient, running $30\\u002Fnight. The staff was extremely friendly, with a very pleasant check-in. One drawback that is not due to the hotel itself is that it is directly across the street from a large construction site. Construction began at 6 am, hence not allowing for a full night\\u2019s sleep",
            "Really enjoyed my stay here. The suites are quite spacious and I really enjoyed having a full kitchen with COVID and all\\u2026 The staff were friendly and super helpful when I needed some recommendations. Looking forward to my next visit here",
            "I arrived early and in the rain. I was able to store luggage, check in early and helped find the museum by the very friendly front desk staff.\\nMy room with a king sized bed was clean and comfortable. I loved having my own kitchenette.\\nThe view was lovely and I will definitely stay again",
            "This suite hotel must have been nice when it was an apartment. It hasn't been kept up. the balcony doors are locked. I asked if mine could be opened, and was told that they have been locked for years, and could not be opened. The kitchen is fine to keep things in the fridge and heat things up in the microwave, but I wouldn't be excited to cook in it. It does come with an included  breakfast of coffee\\u002Ftea muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit",
            "I booked the Junior Suite with kitchenette, and a washer & dryer. These were extremely useful! It had a full-sized refrigerator and stove, and a dishwasher.  The suite was very, very clean and comfortable. I was on a high floor, with a great eastern view (note that there is construction on the west side.) Front desk staff are very professional and attentive. They recommended the purchase of a monthly parking pass to save me money. I also recommend using transit downtown. The Bloor\\u002FYonge subway interchange is less than a five minute walk away, and the subway is accessible (elevators and escalators - at least in the city core). The neighbourhood is people-friendly, and well served by caf\\u00E9s, restaurants, shopping, and small grocery markets nearby. Internet service was very good. I don\\u2019t have cable tv at home, and enjoyed watching that. NOTE: As with many suite hotels, housekeeping will visit only once per week; I didn\\u2019t need anything, but the front desk would have obtained extra towels, etc. I would have stayed longer if I could have, and the Town Inn will be my base the next time I am in Toronto. Book early so you get a high floor and a better view!  NOTE ALSO: if you park at the hotel, there are stairs from the parking garage to the elevators. I managed fine, but persons with more severe mobility issues will need to be dropped off at the front entrance or use the \\u201CGreen P Parking\\u201D on Charles Street.\\nThis hotel is an exceptional value for the city centre. Thank you, Town Inn!",
            "The room are fully equipped with Kitchen amenities, they are spacious and comfortable. This hotel is centrally located and easy access to subway and food outlets. Also it is safe location for families who intend to visit Toronto.  Their front office Manager Mr. Vishal was very helpful as he was always available to address our concerns",
            "This is well located hotel with full kitchen and dining table rooms with street views still .\\nSubway station within 10 minutes walk and convenience stores around .\\nEveryday cleaning staff ensured towels and toiletries were replaced daily  and wifi worked pretty well .\\nAman at front office and the manager Vishal need to be complimented for ironing out  our first time stay .Will be back when next time travelling there .\\nOnly some rooms need to be refurbished   and hope would by the time we come back next"

            "This hotel is centrally located inside a building that houses many different businesses.  There are only four rooms, but are they nice.  We would enjoy staying here again.  The staff particularly Roger was super.  This place is an oasis in the city.  Only downside is parking is in the lot across the street and is about $25 per day.  It is a bit hard to find as it is next to George Restaurant and there is only a small sign",
            "It's official--The Ivy at Verity is now my new favourite hotel in all of Toronto. From the moment I was greeted at the front door to the morning I left I felt incredibly welcomed and spoiled. The rooms are beautifully decorated and luxurious, I appreciated the self serve open bar set-up outside my door and can't even describe how amazing my meal at the George restaurant was. Incredible experience. I would (and will) highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Toronto from now on. Amazing accommodations",
            "I stayed at the Ivy in November and it was wonderful! The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated and so serene. I especially love the bathroom, and the special touch of the bath salts \\\"buffet\\\". After a night out at the nearby distillery district, we enjoyed decadent desserts from George in the comfort of our room. The service was great. This was my 3rd time at Ivy and I expect I will return again",
            "We stayed here for an evening and had dinner at George restaurant.  What a fabulous experience.  If you are travelling to Toronto, it is walking distance to the financial district, Yonge Street, the Eaton Center shopping mall and great restaurants.  The room was sooo cozy, heated flooring, spacious bathrooms with various scented bath salts, contemporary design.  The breakfast in the morning was right outside the door and we enjoyed eatting in bed.  Dinner at George was AMAZING.  The food, the service were top notch.  I highly recommend it.  There are only a few rooms, each one is decorated differently.  The spa though is women only, so sorry guys. If you are looking for a boutique hotel that is cozy, in a great location and can splurge, Verity is for you",
            "The Ivy was the last word in luxury - from a $30,000 mattress (should've come with George Clooney!) to marble tiled bathroom and glorious Bulgari amenities. Sound-proofed room, a sumptuous continental breakfast daily to our door and so very much more - from check-in to departure - made this a stay I've not stopped talking about",
            "Room could not have be nicer or more comfortable.\\nI wanted to give all top reviews becauae of this ....but a few things lacking.\\nService was average, there are other things in the building womans club,gym,spa so hotel service was a bit off. Like last on list.\\nThe breakfast was placed so nice, but was not really up to par. Juice and fruit good,but breads were a bit tough with no where to heat. Forgot our turn down service two of the four nights (there are only four rooms) \\",
            "What a gem of a hotel.  Beautiful decor, impeccably maintained, and can't say enough about the most comfortable bed we've ever experienced.  The bathroom has heated floors, and the scent of homemade bathsalts (lavender, jasmine and eucalyptus) permeated through to the bedroom.  Would definitely stay there again",
            "Had a girl trip July 7th thru July11th and had picked The Ivy at Verity.  So glad we did!  It was wonderful.  Couldn't hardly get out of bed in the morning because the bed was like sleeping on a cloud!  The breakfast was amazing.  Fresh croissants and banana bread, fruit and yogurt. The pool area was beautiful and relaxing.  The highlight was George, our concierge, who was too wonderful for words!  He was so helpful with helping plan our day and making suggestions for us.  He found out we loved iced tea, so always had it ready for us at any time of the day.  He booked our day trip to Niagra Falls, which was wonderful.  We didn't want to leave!  I would never want to stay anyplace else in Toronto.  Loved it, loved it!  Miss you now, George!!  You made our trip the best",
            "I've been staying in Marriotts, Hiltons and Holiday Inns for over 4 years with work, but it's only by coming to The Ivy that I'm reminded how good a hotel experience you can have if you go to the boutique places.\\nThe first thing is even though this is effectively 'an old boys club for women', my wife booked it for our first trip to Toronto and we both found it to be utterly beautiful, relaxing and a joy to stay in. We could happily move into room 3 and never leave, the bed and bathroom are brilliant, the honesty bar and espresso machine outside the room make you feel at home to come and go as you please, the staff were super friendly and helpful, and even though the spa is women only they allowed us in after hours. As for the George restaurant, we've never had a better tasting menu anywhere in the world. A rare foodie experience I'll not forget in a hurry.\\nOne of those places that genuinely nourishes your body and mind. Can't say enough good things about it",
            "We live in Toronto, but I surprised my husband with  here for one night on our wedding anniversary in April 2014.  He had no idea there were even rooms at the Verity and was excited (perhaps unnecessarily) that we were visiting a \\\"ladies club\\\" for our anniversary, ha ha. Our experience was so positive from start to finish. It's such a little gem. Our room rivalled any hotel room we've been to around the world--gorgeous huge bathroom, comfy beds, beautiful amenties. The honour bar was lovely too, so quaint. Staff were excellent..rooms were beautifully maintained, well cleaned, front desk staff was attentive etc. My husband had in in room massage and I had a manicure downstiars--the BEST it lasted for over a week!)--plus one of the ladies gave me a make up lesson at the fun\\u002Finteractive make up bar. Spa is really lovely.  Then we had a great dinner at George (food was out of this world although the waiter was a bit haughty). Overall I would highly recommend the Ivy and the package we had. A great escape in the city",
            "We just left Toronto and loved our stay at the Ivy at Verity. The hotel is at a women's club and there are only four rooms, so taxi drivers tour buses, etc may not be familiar with it. Just made us more thankful we found this hidden gem. We actually stayed in two different rooms for our two night stay (2 and 4). Both were very specious, with large balconies, tasteful decor, and lots of natural light. The beds were super comfortable and it was very cozy and upscale at the same time. The bathrooms were huge. The staff was very responsive and helpful, particularly George. They provided a simple breakfast and were very eager to help with any questions we had. A great place for a couples getaway. We also enjoyed appetizers in the club's lounge and were very impressed with the quality of the food",
            "The Ivy is a wonderful boutique hotel in downtown Toronto.  Everything in the room is top notch from the overall spaciousness of the room, the decor, the walk-in shower room, the deep soaking tub, upscale ammenities etc.  The staff were attentive and accommodating and helped make our stay a great one.  We would recommend this hotel highly to anyone",
            "To start off, the reception greeted me with smiles and hospitality.  The room was extremely clean and set up with bath salts and nice music.  The bed was like drifting on a soft cloud.  The decor and art were stunning and well thought out.  I felt at home and much relaxed in this hotel and didn't want to leave.  Especially after an amazing massage done right in the convenience of my room.  The staff was extremely accommodating and allowed me a late check out, so I could soak in the tub with some lavender bath salts (tub big enough for two).  mmmm...\\n\\nI would return to this hotel at any opportunity I may have",
            "My wife and I celebrated our 6th wedding anniversary in July and booked a room at the Ivy and dinner at George.  The hotel and restaurant were amazing. I have stayed at other upscale hotels in Toronto like the Trump and I think the Ivy is excellent value for the price and the service is terrific. We stayed in room #4 which was very spacious and faced a beautiful courtyard. I definitely would stay here again",
            "We just spent one blissful night at The Ivy at Verity. Could have stayed longer but the hotel was fully booked for the rest of the week. However, even the one night was enough for us to enjoy the wonderful surprises that this hotel offers. This place is a piece of heaven, when you enter the hotel through the Club \\\"Verity\\\" you are transported into another dimension, where your every wish is fulfilled. Our room was tasteful as it was beautiful, colors that soothe, bed linens that feel like \\\"cloud 9\\\", nothing missing or lacking. Best of all, we get to use the facilities of Verity's Sweetgrass Spa, and wine & dine at \\\"George\\\" Verity's 5-star restaurant, all under the same roof. After one night I am refreshed and rejuvenated, as if I spent a week at a resort. A place like this is hard to find, lucky for me I found it. Can't wait to return",
            "This hotel is amazing!  Concierge are very helpful and informative. Room 4 was very large, beautifully decorated with a balcony over looking the courtyard.  Lovely bathroom with bathtub, separate shower and heated floor.  Three types of scented bath salts are available for your bathing pleasure!  An honour bar is available with red and white wine and a selection of spirits.  Continental breakfast, including in house freshly baked croissants is left outside your door at 8am.  \\n\\nDinner is highly recommended at the award winning George Restaurant!\\n\\nI give this hotel 10 out of 10!  Can't wait to go back",
            "We stayed here after our wedding before going home to Etobicoke, and I am so happy that we did! We arrived late (about 1am?) and the concierge was there to greet us and take a breakfast order. The room was well-appointed - beautiful furniture, gorgeous lighting, a patio overlooking the courtyard.  The bed was easily the most comfortable I've ever slept on in my life. And the bathroom! HUGE tub, heavenly salts, separate toilet and shower stalls... just to die for. Breakfast was juice, coffee\\u002Ftea, pastries, yogurt & fruit -- and was waiting on a tray for us in the lobby area which also had a nice bar to choose from (though we weren't in the mood to take advantage of it seeing as it was 9am). I would recommend this place to everyone",
            "This hotel is part of a small, elegant upscale spa and restaurant complex and women's club. The restaurant is superior as are the spa facilities and the rooms.  Decoration is in impeccable taste in every part of the complex.  The beds are British--Hypnos is the brand.  They are ultra-luxury in price; more importantly, they make for an exceptional sleep. We had a perfect escape to an elegant oasis in the middle of Toronto in the winter.  Highly recommended",
            "Stayed in room #4 for one night. Concierge was so accommodating- helped with parking and showing us all the ammenities. \\nThe room was spacious and beautiful. Large patio. Complimentary bath salt bar over the spa tub, separate stand up shower and toilet rooms. \\nThe hotel also had a bar for guests in a small sitting area outside the room. It worked based on the honesty system- each drink you had you recorded and were charged 6$\\u002Falcoholic beverage at the end of your stay. They had wine, beer, and all sorts of hard liquor + mix. \\nThere was a complimentary continental breakfast waiting on a table outside your room starting at 715- and when you were ready you called the concierge to bring a pot of fresh coffee. \\nOverall lovely, romantic spot. We also purchased the 4 course tasting menu at George which was amazing. Will return!",
            "We always like to stay in what we call small luxury hotels or special places. The Ivy is both. In the hart of a former chocolate factory you find a hotel space that is very special. Great design, fine materials, very quiet airco, fine linen, great shower, lots of space for your clothes and bags. And breakfast is served in your room! At 08.00 it is outside your door, get it in and enjoy all you ordered the evening before. Very nice and helpful staff",
            "We stayed at the Ivy for one night -- our honeymoon -- and it was fantastic. It is truly an oasis in the heart of downtown Toronto and you will be pampered! The beds are so plush, you will not want to get out of bed. We especially enjoyed the very spacious and stylish bathrooms, especially the very large and lovely soaking tub and showers. Can't wait to go back",
            "Definitely not your usual hotel. Looking for a home away your home.....This is the place where to go when you are in Toronto. Even if not located in some fancy neighborhoods, this place is a gem. At first a \\\"Women's club\\\" , the Ivy offers some rooms now... Mine was .. Yes ... awesome. A large room with a large bed, a pretty big bathroom with for the first time ever of my life a bath salt \\\"bar\\\" ... Breakfast it serve at your door at the requested time. Might be a little bit light (missing some toasts and butter), ordered croissants and chocolate brioche and ends-up with a muffin with grapes   ... But this was good.\\nTeam is great ... I will highly recommend this place ... Especially if you are a woman ... Next time i will try the SPA",
            "We stayed at the Ivy for the weekend of our wedding. I had a few services at the Sweetgrass Spa and We had an amazing dinner at George the night before and then prep rooms and photos on the grounds on the day of. The rooms are stunning and the staff was spectacular and helped make the weekend everything one could hope for! We'll definitely be coming back on anniversaries to come",
            "If you like plush  guesthouses then this is for you. Big rooms, beautiful big bathroom and not far from the nicer parts of town. Extensive basics \\u002Fservices are explained to you upon arrival and so you do feel like you're in a plush guesthouse rather than a efficient luxury hotel. The mini bar and breakfast area (even for in room breakfasts) are in a small shared space. The reception is one of those low down desks hence the guesthouse\\u002F plush b&b feel. Men cannot use any of the spa facilities, not even the gym :( Great for a traveling business woman who spends a lot of time in plush hotels and wants a more the social experience you would get in a b&b\\u002Fguesthouse.",
            "The Ivy at Verity is actually four lovely rooms within a private club for women, although they are available to anyone.  The rooms are large, beautifully presented, immaculate, and comfortable.  The bathroom was large and impressive.  One minor flaw (if you are a reader) is that the lighting is very low.  While not unpleasant it does make it a bit difficult to read once the drapes have been pulled.  During the day the large windows let in plenty of light.  The staff is about as accommodating as it is possible to be.  Breakfast is presented in the public room just outside the four separate guest rooms on trays that are then taken to one's own room (where there is a table and chairs perfect for eating).  Generally it is a continental breakfast, but it is possible to order some additions if one wishes.  There is a pod-style coffee maker available at all times, and while sweeteners are provided there was no milk or cream unless it was requested.  There is a small, private cafe\\u002Frestaurant within the complex that has a good, but limited menu, and another restaurant as well as a busy pub within the two adjacent buildings.  While there is no valet or in-house parking, there is a public lot immediately across the street.  The parking is metered (and expensive) but very convenient.  Just east of Yonge Street it is a bit out-of-the-way, but still only a few blocks to the Eaton Center.  It was easy to get a taxi to travel to the other parts of the city, or a short walk takes you to the Metro.  Cheap it was not, but very pleasant",
            "Spent a wonderful weekend in Toronto at The Ivy at Verity.  A boutique hotel with just 4 rooms. Our was beautifully decorated, spacious with an amazing bathroom.   They have thought of everything -- honor bar, round the clock concierge and unique touches like freshly brewed tea to enjoy while you soak in a huge tub soaking in specially chosen bath salts.   It was a truly magical experience.   Can't imagine every staying anywhere else in Toronto.   Book ahead so you won't miss out",
            "We absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was so welcoming and helpful. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was perfect. \\nThis hotel is owned by the women's club and was originally used exclusively by the club for when they had guests in town. Now anyone can book a room if you are lucky enough to nab one. There are only four rooms in the entire hotel and they are separated away from the rest of the club so it is very quiet. The rooms are very large with a king bed and beautiful full wall windows with a door onto a private balcony. Each room is color coded and unique. the bathroom comes with heated floors, a separate room for the toilet, an amazing shower, and the largest bath tub I have ever seen. I am 6'2\\\" and I could stretch out in the tub with room to spare. The added bonus is the in house made bath salt that they provide in three different scents.\\nYou also get breakfast delivered to your door. It is not a large meal but it gets you through to lunch. \\nThe last thing I have to say is that you MUST have dinner at George while you are there. This restaurant specializes in tasting menus for all dietary plans. The biggest benefit is that after your three hour multi -course meal you just have to walk up the hidden staircase to your room (never leaving the building). \\nI will definitely stay here again if ever back in Toronto",
            "A Gem in a perfect location. Where do I begin. I was greeted by a super nice and friendly staff. I was early for an appointment but interested in my wedding possibly there. I met with planner immediately who was a sweetheart. Just for any thinking about a wedding there, the prices can't be beat!  When I returned I was taken up to my room. The hotel is so lush, with velvet, satin,art work, a library and lounge. One of my favourite features is the honour bar which has inexpensive drinks, free pop, and a espresso coffee machine and tea. The best part was it was right out my bedroom door. The continental breakfast was just the right amount and delicious. The room was just WOW!  It was huge and the wonderful scent from the bath crystals was light yet a delight to the senses. The fixtures were unusual and very artsy. The bathroom was huge! Everything was soft and plush from towels, bedding and bath robes. I only had the pleasure of one night so not enough time to explore all the hotel and neighborhood had to offer. The menu was on a tablet, unlike some hotels where they are a bit used and messy. If you needed something, a friendly staff member was there quickly. I really can't say enough about this wonderful hotel and staff!  Thank you for an amazing night",
            "I wouldn't have even known this was their unless we were staying there as part of a wedding party, but it was truly a special little oasis in the city.  The room was massive by inner city standards.  There was a king size bed, little sitting are for reading and another one with a little table for eating\\u002Fdrinks.   There was also a large patio with a table overlooking a quiet courtyard.  Never once did it sound like we were in a city.  The bathroom was also huge and had a great assortment of quality soaps including 3 different scents of bath salts.   Room included a continental breakfast.  There also was an open area outside the room with complimentary soft drinks and cocktails for fee.  Would highly recommend this quiet, gem in the city",
            "The Ivy is a hidden gem in the centre of Toronto.  Spacious beautifully decorated rooms, luxurious linens and the bathrooms are stocked with the best toiletries - a deep bath and separate shower stall.  You  feel pampered and regenerated.  Great dinner package options at George restaurant and spa options at the spa. Small and personal - treat yourself",
            "We chose the Ivy's Urban Retreat package for one night as a way to celebrate our anniversary in Toronto. In the city, there are no shortage of luxury hotel options, but it can be difficult to find a place to stay that is really in the \\\"boutique\\\" category while offering privacy, luxury, fun, and peace while away from home. In just about every category for evaluation, the Ivy excels. This 4-room hotel downtown stands out and above other options in Toronto, and we're thrilled to have discovered it.\\n\\nYou can request a particular room when booking, and we chose room #2. With a calming colour scheme, plenty of space, a gorgeous marble bathroom (deep tub and huge shower room!), and a large flat screen with a blu-ray player, it's well-outfitted, comfortable, and very quiet. You have access to a refreshments area with honour bar and complimentary soft drinks, as well as access to the members only lounge area, which we didn't make use of. Their packages have incredible value, and we had the chance to enjoy an included five-course meal at the onsite George restaurant and an hour long massage at the onsite Sweetgrass spa. \\n\\nTo clarify some confusion amongst the reviews and elsewhere, Verity is the parent company here and responsible for the spa and restaurant, as well as the hotel. The spa (and this includes all available fitness facilities) is women only, but this absolutely does not mean that men are somehow unwelcome. In fact, should you wish, men can request in-room spa services. As a male guest, I absolutely loved my stay here, and my partner was able to make use of the beautiful spa facilities. \\n\\nToronto seems to be a city where it can be difficult to feel as if value matches cost for accommodations. The Ivy at Verity bucks this unfortunate trend and offers an experience we hope to someday return for",
            "The Ivy is a small unique hotel -  four rooms in total - all different and beautifully appointed.  The beds are the most comfortable ever, with the finest of linens.  Decor is simply gorgeous,  beautiful ly upholstered seating, exposed brick walls and lovely wallpapers, bamboo hardwood floors and bamboo tiles in the luxurious bathrooms. Each room has a balcony overlooking an inner city courtyard.  The Ivy is part of Verity Womens Club and upstairs from George Restaurant.  The club's spa and fitness facilities are open to guests .  You feel like a pampered personal friend  rather than a hotel guest..  A small guest lounge with a marble table with selection of fine spirits and wine is part of the lovely surroundings.  Definitely for discerning independent travellers who like to discover unique and special properties",
            "My husband and I stay in Toronto every few months so like to try different hotels each time. Recent stays have included Intercontinental Yorkville, Pantages, and Ritz-Carlton. For our latest stay, we booked a room at The Ivy at Verity. I can honestly say I've never had a more lovely hotel stay! The staff seemed very proud to work there and were both warm and professional.\\nThe room we stayed in (Room 1) was large and beautifully appointed ... The care they've put into decorating each room is apparent in every fabric and furniture choice. The bed was luxuriously comfortable and the bathroom spoiled us with heated floors, marble vanity and a selection of aromatherapy bath salts. \\nThe common area immediately outside the rooms is a charming space with a large granite table used for drinks in the afternoon and breakfast in the morning. Alcohol was $6 a drink (very reasonable) and done on the honour system...all the drinks were out on the table and you filled out a card with what you drank to bring to the concierge later for payment. Espresso and soda was free as was the wifi and a continental breakfast. That breakfast was also delicious! Large flaky, buttery croissants, yoghurt and granola, hard boiled eggs, and juice were waiting on trays labelled with each room number and you simply rang the concierge to have fresh coffee delivered when you woke up.  \\nI didn't want to leave! I can't wait to try this hotel in the summer and enjoy the lovely terrace.\\nWell done, Ivy... You've created a little oasis in the heart of the city",
            "The Ivy isn\\u00B4t so much a classical hotel. It\\u00B4s a business club with serveral nice meeting lounges, a lady fitness studio, a spa and perhaps the best restaurant \\\"George\\\" I have ever eaten at. We were told - also there was no one, when we we stayed - that the Ivy is a hot spot for weddings in Toronto. And I can understand this.\\n\\nThe rooms - they only have four, so feel yourself luck if you get one - are big and lovely decorated, with over king size beds which might be the most comfortable I ever had sleeped in, a big bath - seperated shower and closet - with Bulgari toiletries and several different bathing salts available for disposal in the big bathing tube.\\n\\nThe breakfast - croissant, cake, fresh fruit and juice, coffee or tea, everything excellent - was offered on tray outside the room on an old french pastries table and had to be carried in your room. We ate it on our balcony with view to the patio. Great start of the day. Coffee (Nespresso) and softdrinks were complimentary the whole day. \\n\\nThe hotel itself is very central, probably 10 min walk to Eaton Center with a subway station just around the corner and big public parking space on the other side of the street.\\n \\nSo go there, even if you don\\u00B4t want to mary",
            "Not only our favorite place in Toronto, the Ivy at Verity is one of the nicest and most perfects hotels we have ever stayed at.  My mom and I, who take a trip every year, enjoyed the spacious and intricately decorated Room # 3.  Everything was spotless, comfortable, and beautiful.  Every detail of this \\\"hotel\\\" (more like an oasis) was designed and thought through.  I oftentimes found myself wanting to return to the Ivy and other areas of Verity (Sweetgrass Spa, Member's lounge, Library, Computer area) to lounge in the chairs, hang out on the room's large private patio, have a drink at the private honor bar, or take a dip in the pool or bath (prepared with salts and tea preparations).  The concierge was available 24hrs and extremely kind and helpful in accommodating any of our needs or desires, altering our daily delivered breakfasts, making reservations and offering suggestions catered to our likes, and personally introducing us to the host at George Restaurant before our reservation.  We cannot say enough good things about the Ivy\\u002FVerity\\u002FSweetgrass Spa, where you can find every amenity at high quality, spectacular service, and a beautiful ambience.  It is private but alive, and suited for a getaway, for business, and for romance.  With an entrance through Verity, as well as a private entrance (with secure coded door) for the rooms, a guest can customize his\\u002Fher stay.  The location was central to many places such as a few blocks from the subway, or a walk to St. Lawrence Market\\u002FDundas.  We cannot wait to return and could have enjoyed many more days at the Ivy at Verity!  Thank you for a wonderful experience",
            "I took my wife here for spa and a weekend get away. The facilities are wonderful. The atmosphere is very cozy.  Remember this is a more or less a women\\u2019s health club. Everything to do and eat is nearby. We had an excellent stay.  Rooms are gorgeous .  The morning breakfast is so healthy and perfect. I love this place.",
            "We live in Toronto and were celebrating- my birthday, my husbands birthday and my best friend's and her husband's birthday all fall within a month of each other, so we decided this year to celebrate in style- a night at the Ivy. We kicked things off first at the Sweetgrass spa (for women only) then enjoyed a 10 course tasting menu on George's beautiful courtyard patio.\\n \\nGoing with another couple allowed me to gawk at their room too (room #1). I love how this hotel has only four rooms and all are tasteful and elegant, and so different. Our room (#3) was a glamorous blend of modern mixed with classic timeless materials, a nod to their chocolate factory past. Gorgeous blue wallpaper is charming against the relic brick of a bygone era. The rooms themselves are massive, much roomier than any other downtown hotel I've seen. With different seating areas to recline and relax, including a sunny deck that faces George's patio, my husband and I loved every minute of our stay. The bathroom has a super deep soaker tub and inviting aromatic bath salts- they have clearly anticipated your every thought! \\nOne feature I loved was the Samsung tablet that you use to control the television, but also acts as a portable TV, which they have linked to Netflix...cue the Orange is the New Black marathon! \\n\\nMy bestie's room was an intimate portrait of a Parisian hotel, soft pink striped wallpaper was welcoming and warm. Her room was every bit as luxurious as mine, every detail carefully constructed. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back, absolutely adore the staff, spa and restaurant here. It's a rare gem in a city full of over-done, over hyped hotels (IMHO). Nice gestures like the honour bar and delicious complimentary breakfast are just the finishing touches to a spoiled brat weekend. Thanks Ivy",
            "I absolutely love the Ivy Hotel and have stayed there several times.  It is a perfect retreat for a romantic get away with your partner and there are several packages available which include dinner at the hotel's George Restaurant.   I have also used the Ivy when having a girls' day with my sister, niece and mom at the adjacent Sweetgrass Spa and an evening out so the room was nice to come back to.   In addition, I have used the Ivy for business purposes if I book a corporate dinner at George or have meetings downtown the next day, the Ivy is conveniently situated in the downtown core.   The 4 room boutique hotel is luxurious and cozy with a unique ambience.  The staff and service is attentive. I am already looking forward to my next stay",
            "Things I loved about the Ivy:\\nThe pillows\\nGiant bath and nice bath salts\\nThe fancy ginger ale (Fever Tree)\\nThe hairdryer (no awful travel ones here)\\nThe balcony\\nFree Nespresso\\nThe lovely staff\\nThe Bulgari ammenities (I want to smell like this forever)\\nPretty wallpaper\\nFresh flowers everywher",
            "This centrally located downtown Toronto hotel is extremely spacious, beautifully appointed and impeccably conceived. I'd like to move in. (The continental breakfast delivered to your door, the heated flooring in the very large bathroom, the generous balcony overlooking the intimate brick courtyard, the gorgeous drapes and furniture...) And yes, of course, all the technology required for a 21st century traveler",
            "Got a chance to stay at Ivy in colourful Room 3 (each of the 4 rooms is different in size or decor) on a Saturday night.  Pure bliss!  Huge bathroom with separate room for the toilet and separate large shower stall and huge soaker tub with choice of scented bath salts.  High-end Hastens bed, swivel wall-mounted flat screen large TV, desk, 2 upholstered chairs, overstuffed armchair, ottoman, actual balcony facing peaceful courtyard (over George restaurant), and complimentary continental breakfast (coffee ready to order) and honour bar (several full-size bottles but no gin; two kinds of wine and assorted beers kept on ice) available just outside the room for in-room enjoyment.  \\n\\nBeing a Saturday\\u002FSunday, the business centre\\u002Flibrary area of the private women's club upstairs was empty and the concierge said I could use it.  Although the gorgeous basement-level pool, hot tub, and spa area is women-only, I still recommend this place to couples if the man can skip that part.  We got the urban one-night getaway package, so a 4 course tasting menu at George was included.  The service at George was a little rough -- we weren't offered any upgrades or wine pairings and the amuse bouche and first two courses came out too quickly --  we hadn't even received our aperitif cocktails yet!\\n\\nIvy is significantly cheaper than staying at Hazelton but now that I've stayed overnight at both, I would choose Ivy again and again.  The only difference is the slightly smaller closet space at Ivy compared to the two-sided closet\\u002Fstorage area in Hazelton rooms, and the lack of a TV in the bathroom at Ivy.  Otherwise the room setup and comfort quality is the same.  Ivy provides Bulgari white tea scented toiletries along with the choice of 3 scented bath salts.  Hazelton provides a fridge in-room stocked only with wine products and teas whereas Ivy gives many choices just outside the room and a free breakfast (Ivy continental included 2 kinds of croissants, jam, apple strudel slices, an interesting coconut oatmeal porridge that tasted great at room temperature, fresh berry fruit salad, choice of orange or grapefruit juice, and hot tea or coffee on demand.)  Yes, Hazelton does room service and has a restaurant open for brunch on site, whereas George at Ivy does not provide that flexibility.  The indoor pool at Hazelton was a huge disappointment (no windows, awful lighting and no relaxation area around the pool) whereas the women-only pool at Ivy is lovely and even has an underwater treadmill!  Queen Street East between Church and Jarvis is no Yorkville.  But for $200+ less on average per night, Ivy offers better value at a similar standard",
            "I found the Ivy on hotels.com. Thought it sounded unique and it is! Four gorgeously and differently appointed rooms. Huge bathroom with rain shower and deep soaking tub, including in-house-made, complimentary bath salts - a nice touch after a long day of walking. There is an honor bar with white wine, liquors, and soft drinks. Also tea bags and instant coffee. Continental breakfast is included and it is quite ample - yogurt\\u002Fgranola, boiled egg, croissant or muffin, juices, and coffee\\u002Fcream. Really nice.\\n\\nThe only difficulty that I encountered was a previously unannounced electricity outage one night from 10pm to 4am the following morning. WEIRD. A letter left in my room. No explanation. Battery lantern and flashlight provided. \\n\\nThe building is in a sort of run-down block of Queen St just a bit east of the better parts of Queen St West. But I did not feel unsafe. \\n\\nThere is a great women's clothing store a few doors down. Don't miss it! And an excellent antiques store in the the next block east. Plenty of good restaurants a block or two away as well as the upscale George attached.\\n\\nLovely subterranean swimming pool and hot tub. And a spa",
            "The rooms at the Ivy are so beautiful, you really don't want to leave them.  Save time to enjoy the spa like bath, with an assortment of scented salts and heated floors - enjoy a drink or breakfast on the balcony overlooking the secluded patio of the George restaurant - and make sure you get your full eight hours sleep in the heavenly beds - amazing comfort and luxury.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, each one with a different interior design, and unlike anything you would get at a large chain hotel.  Within walking distance of downtown Toronto, the Ivy is conveniently located albeit off the beaten path.  We liked being able to enjoy a bottle of champagne in the seating area outside the rooms as a group - almost like being in your own home - before heading downstairs to the wonderful George restaurant. Personal and knowledgable concierge staff - access to Internet and computers - on site spa - and ambience from the exclusive Verity Women's Club.  I have stayed at the Ivy many times, and already am looking forward to my next visit",
            "The Ivy at Verity is a tiny hotel. The set up seems odd at first... it is an exclusive women's club with gym, spa, library, lounges etc, and tucked away on a upper floor, the 4 lovely and spacious guest rooms.  The rooms overlook a court yard and face the windows of an ad agency, where you can see folks working away. At first it felt a bit like we were in a bedroom at work. We kept our drapes closed and all was well. As a woman, all of the amenities were amazing. I think if I had been travelling with a male companion it would have been disappointing.  I was in room three and it was BEAUTIFUL.  Just my style. Very comfortable king bed, incredible bathroom with an irresistible bathtub. All of the soaps and salts and lotions were really lovely and great quality. The room had lots of plush seating, and huge balcony. The honour bar, just outside of the rooms was a really nice touch - although when I was there it was not properly stocked and was never replenished, even after two calls to the concierge. Location is central enough to walk downtown, has a transit stop right out front, and there is paid parking directly across the street. I thought the breakfast was quite good. This will always be my first choice hotel when I stay in Toronto, I really loved it",
            "Amazing getaway in the heart of Toronto.  Great location, only four rooms in the entire hotel, gorgeous boardrooms, library, balconies.  The hotel rooms are enormous, luxurious, romantic and spotless.  The spa downstairs is just for women (which was kind of wonderful) but the male half of a couple might feel a little left out.  Then he should remind himself that he gets paid more than his wife does to do the same job\\u2026 and go relax in the giant bathtub instead",
            "Strange setting, 4 room hotel inside a women's only networking club in central Toronto.\\nSet in a beautifully renovated industrial complex, the room was a treat to the senses, salts for the bath, special wood floors in the bathroom. Everything about the room was perfect. We also had a beautiful little terrace overlooking a courtyard where we had breakfast.\\nThe affiliated George restaurant was also magnificent, and all the staff was attentive and knowledgable.\\nI loved the place.\\nI'll definitely go back",
            "The Ivy at Verity ( a private women's club in downtown Toronto) attached to 5 star dining at George Restaurant with it's own private courtyard patio.\\nPosh but cozy, exclusive but welcoming. So beautiful and stylish but with plenty of substance. The people are warm and helpful and the beds are Hastens so the best sleep ever acheived. There is a Verity spa (complete with hot tub, steam room, and sauna ) on property called Sweetgrass that is exclusive for women but men staying in the hotel can have treatments in their hotel room. They even have fitness facilities (again, exclusive to women)  and you can add on a yoga class if you want for a nominal fee.\\nFabulous stay, incredible bed, God is here, in the deails",
            "This boutique hotel is exactly that. Small, but beautifully put together. Staff were all fantastic. Rooms perfect. Best bathrooms we've found in Canada, and when the weather allows a lovely veranda to sit on. Attached is a ladies health club and spa, and if I lived in Toronto I would join. Can you start one in England  - preferably near where I live \\uD83D\\uDE04 Husband and I had a champagne breakfast to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was lovely",
            "You owe it to yourself ( and to your spouse) to go on quick getaways and this Spa is ideal for that purpose. With Only 4 rooms it does require a bit of planning but once you have been whisked to iour private paradise, the biggest problem will be to get your better half to leave the room ! Starting with a show piece Hastens bed,  Italian linens  your ill undoubtebly have the best sleep of your life! A Wall of windows and french doors open up to  a gorgeous  indoor courtyard. ( I guess a summer visit is required), .\\nWe have now been spoiled for any other hotel room ever again!\\nWe will be back hereoften, often,  often and we look forward to trying George, the restaurant on the main floor.",
            "This is a hotel within a women-only club, so only females have access to the pool, spa and gym.  The rooms are great, and service is excellent, so I didn't mind staying in the room or walking in the neighborhood while my wife enjoyed the facilitie"

            "We recently visited this establishment. I travelled with 10 of my close friends. We are all between the ages of 40 and 50 and we\\u2019re all very disappointed with the accommodations. We purposely booked the weekend at this hotel for our bachelorette party because of the amenities that they offered first off our experience was to be started at the rooftop restaurant, which, of course was no fault to the restaurant got cancelled because of the rain, however They had no accommodations for us alternatively, in the hotel therefore we had no dinner reservations. We had to go to roses social, which was OK but the menu is just for pub food basically And of course it was too late to get any reservation at a nice restaurant in Toronto so even though they had interior seating for Valerie, they did not accommodate us because they were overbooked\\nThe hotel was extremely packed way too many people and therefore even to get some lunch, it was impossible. The caf\\u00E9 was closed at 3:00 PM and we ordered room service, which was our only choice since everything else was packed and it took over an hour and a half to get any type of food., Service Food was good once we actually received it\\nFollowing our dinner was supposed to be entertainment on level 27 as well as the lobby bar, which is a public bar that they normally have open to which were closed due to the 27th floor for personal party and the lobby bar is completely closed when they knew they had a full Capacity hotel that was further from the downtown region. I called to discuss charges on my card as well as my disappointment and of course no return call. No one seem to know or care about anything there Other than the one bartender at the pool bar Who completely resonated with us. \\nI would never return to this establishment. It was a complete disappointment",
            "We stayed 5 nights in December visiting from\\nVancouver and we had such a great experience from the time we checked in. The staff were all very friendly and helpful especially Priyan he went over and beyond to ensure we had the right room and even showed us a few upgrade options. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are especially clean and well laid out. Housekeeping did a very good job with daily water replenishment and the Nespresso machine was a great bonus. The powered window coverings worked very well and having L\\u2019Occitane bath products just confirms that this hotel stay is going to be good. The heat thermostat worked well and the washroom fan was so quiet you could not tell it was on! We used the theatre one evening and with our kids we had popcorn and again the service was amazing. The rooftop pool even in December was nice and warm.\\n\\nThank you for making our stay a real home from home experience and we had such an excellent time in Toronto and Hotel X exceeded our expectations",
            "Stayed here for two nights in a suite for a wedding (October 14-16). The views are unparalleled and the room was well equipped and classically decorated \\u002F furnished. Not super modern or chic, but tastefully done.\\n\\nThe staff were extremely accommodating and offered us complimentary parking, late check-out, chocolate-covered strawberries and hastily catered to multiple requests without any issue whatsoever. Top grades all around.\\n\\nWe didn\\u2019t have an opportunity to take advantage of the many amenities the property has to offer, and didn\\u2019t eat at the restaurants either. That being said, we did order room service for breakfast, and although a few more options would have been nice, what we did order off the menu was done to perfection",
            "Booked the hotel for its location close to where my son is living in Toronto and we were delighted with the location, room and service. Convenient for the tranlines running along the front and in the Exhibition Area we stayed for 3 nights and then after a trip to Niagara Falls stayed another night before returning to UK. On both occasions our room was immaculate (a twin Queen bed room). It was spacious with a great shower\\u002Fbath and room for a couple to spread out their wash things - so often no shelves or space. All of the facilities you would hope for were in the room (safe, iron, hair dryer etc) The views from the room were fantastic, overlooking the Lake and the airport (but with no noise). The Roses Restaurant was convenient for breakfast and dinner, and we were very well looked after by the staff including when we brought in my grandson (5 months old) who was warmly welcomed. Cafe X is great for a quick breakfast coffee and Croison while Valeries will meet the needs of the young at heart on the 28th floor adjacent to the rooftop pool. Overall, a very enjoyable experience that we will certainly book again when next in Toronto.",
            "Upon check in after having booked room months in advance, I was taken by a very kind and polite young man from Ireland, Chris, to a high floor with King Size Bed as requested. Upon reaching the room I found that my 6'7\\\" 265 pound frame was supposed to check in to a wheel chair accessible room. This is not at all what I had requested. My Business booked and paid for three rooms for a total of 8 nights worth of business, over $3000 worth of revenue to your property. Manager Nick, was not able to accommodate a resolution aside from moving me to the 19th floor. There were not any considerations provided for this nor any throughout the remainder of our stay. We visited the 28th floor bar on several occasions spending over a thousand dollars. The very fit chap that interacted with us a number of times was very brusque, overly concerned about our group and whether or not we could attend the patio and then overly brusque regarding our immediate need to pay for our expensive beverages prior to being on the patio once it was pointed out that others were out there and what indeed was the issue with our also being out there. Not the type of experience we expected for the price we paid and the excitement we all anticipated being at the X Hotel and having the opportunity to enjoy a view and experience of the 28th floor over looking Lake Ontario. The convenience to our trade show at Enercare center made the X seem the right choice. While I appreciate how busy you folks were I believe there were some missed opportunities in compassion and remedy that would have created the experience we had anticipated and hoped for.",
            "My second stay at the X Hotel and once again I truly enjoyed this hotel along with the attentive and courteous staff.  The roof top pool is a definite asset for me on warm sunny days. One that I took advance of and truly enjoyed.  The hotel is not far from the downtown core which is for me an asset as it is a little more quiet than the core downtown ones.  It is also a short taxi or Uber ride away (about $12 CDN) if one wants to go and enjoy activities such as a Bleu Jays, Raptors, Maple Leafs game or visit the CN tower or aquarium.  The view from my room also provided me with what I believe has been the best panoramic view of Downtown Toronto that I have seen to date.  Again, I truly enjoyed my stay and plan on staying there again in the future",
            "My stay here was so amazing! It was a great staycation. The COVID protocol is on point. All the staff wear their masks correctly, self cleaning elevator buttons, sanitizer everywhere, pool bookings are 2 hours so you always get time at the pool, the lounge chairs are spaced out as well as seating in the restaurants.\\n\\nThe staff were all so nice. We got a sweets tray upon welcome, early check in, late check out, extra pool bookings, free parking, breakfast for two, room upgrade. I recommend booking the bed and breakfast package - it's worth it!\\n\\nNo complaints at all. Great job Hotel X and thank you!",
            "We stayed in Hotel X in June 2024 as part of a 3 week holiday. From the moment we checked in the staff were so helpful, we received complimentary cold bottles of water and the check-in process was so smooth! \\n\\nOur room was fab, great size and the hotels location is perfect. On the other side of the main road in the marina and there's a perfect little walkway into midtown. There are also rental bikes across the road which we used. \\n\\nThe staff were really helpful and gave us lots of tips and helpful advice. You also get free use of the house car within a 5km boundary. Make sure and book this service in advance with reception",
            "We arrived at the hotel and it is beautiful the view is very nice! The problems begin with the fact that they are advertised as a luxury hotel while the wait staff is beyond stuck up! When you are paying 600$ a night for a room you would except to get some level of care from the staff! We tipped at least 20 percent for everything! There is no coffee in the rooms if you want coffee you have to pay 10.50 for a pot and of course tip room service. There is no ice machines if you want ice you have to call room service and wait for them to bring it to you in a tiny bucket and also tip of course. A wrap with deli lunch meat turkey and fries was 40$ from room service! The indoor outdoor pool was not warm enough and the inside part was super small there was also no hot tub. Overall it was a very disappointing experience",

I called countless times with no answer ahead of time, and emailed multiple times over a few weeks prior to our visit. Finally the day before we arrive they wrote to say because we booked on Expedia, we weren't allowed to reserve ahead of time, only those who book directly at the hotel.\\nConsequently, when we arrived we could only go to the pool after 5 pm.\\nTheir rooftop lounge took 25 mins for a drink and both food orders were wrong. \\nWe went to have a drink in the lobby before dinner and we're told that drinks would be 20 mins. \\nI actually stayed here before and the service was Fantastic, not sure what happened to this place- which is unfortunate as I live in the area and would have frequented the place for corporate events",
            "There are truly no words for this hotel . From the moment you arrive to that lobby and scent the views of Toronto are spectacular and the pool only adds to that! The rooms are so well executed with all you need and the full glass windows are OMG! The beds and linen are divine , you truly don\\u2019t want to leave. We ate two meals ( dinner and brunch ) at Roses and both were exceptional ! Service couldn\\u2019t be better . We felt as if we were so special for our entire visit ! If you feel like a magical weekend away, RUN don\\u2019t walk to Hotel X",
            "Hotel has an upscale feel to it. The lobby is very nice and there are several elevators which means you\\u2019re never really waiting around to use one. The staff were excellent. Front desk staff were very organized and professional, restaurant staff were cheerful and amiable. Room was well appointed and clean. The hotel is well situated if you are going to the CNE, events at the Budweiser Stage, or even walking to the Roger\\u2019s Centre (~25 mins). Rooftop view is amazing",
            "Reposting since my first post got deleted. Guess they\\u2019re trying to hid their unethical practices that could possibly be a violation to public health!\\n\\nTo sum up my previous post, I over heard 2 hotel staff members talking to one another in great detail about how the pool water never gets changed. One gentleman mentioned that every night, they dump a ton of chlorine to \\u201Cclean\\u201D the pool. He even said that feces and urine have been found in the pool several times and all they do is scoop it out and dump more chlorine in, which in my opinion does not seem all too effective. You\\u2019re pretty much swimming in a pool with bits of human waste! To my knowledge, the pool water is just as old as the hotel! I do not recommend anyone staying at this shady so call 5 star hotel that can\\u2019t maintain their pool properly",
            "We have travelled al around the world and we have visited many hotels, but this hotel exceeds all expectations! We are spoiled now for the rest of our lives! On my 50th birthday celebration the hotel surprised me  with a cheesecake at breakfast and champagne and chocolate strawberries when we came back in the hotel. Also a free dessert with candle in Maxx kitchen. Then on christmasday we were served a tray with christmas cookies. We loved the swimming pool, with warm water and swimming outside on the rooftop, overlooking Toronto. We loved our stay so much that we decided to cancel our other hotel that we had booked for the end of our vacation and booked again in the same room. When we came back we had a warm welcome in the lobby, thanx to Lawrence. In the room was a card and a fruitbasket. To top it all we got complimentary tickets to the aurora winterfestival. We booked the club room, and had lovely breakfast and wine and dine each day. The staff in the clubroom was very nice, especially Jack, loved talking with you. Thanx hotel X for a wonderfull stay!",
            "This hotel is not only sleek and modern but a perfect place to stay when attending a concert at Bud Stage.  A quick walk over saves so much stress in having to find parking and waiting in traffic.  Had a delicious meal at ROSES Cocina and room service breakfast was amazing as well.  Staff was professional and friendly including the valet staff who did their best to try and keep us dry during a rain storm.  Only real improvement note I would make was when at the pool we didn't see anyone coming around to take drink orders.  We had to go in and order and pick up drinks ourselves.  Not sure if poolside drink service is usually available but may be a missed opportunity for those wanting to enjoy a drink or two while at the pool.  We had two teenagers as well with us who really enjoyed everything about the stay and have already asked to go again!  Thank you for a great night",
            "We had the greatest experience at Hotel X for one night Sept 1st. We stayed in room 1103 (corner suite) was beautiful. The room delivers amazing views of Lake Ontario, Porter Airport, Yacht club, Ontario place and the CNE.  We were lucky to enjoy the jets practicing for the air show & had a great night sleep.  With the window shut it was not noisy at all with the exhibition happening.\\nThe roof top pool views were just as beautiful while enjoying a few drinks.  We had lunch at Roses on the 2nd floor. I have shellfish & egg allergies so brioche buns are not good for me, the server was quick to assure me there would be no issues at all. I enjoyed a tasty burger on grilled sourdough rye, the staff where extremely accommodating and very friendly.   I will surely stay again",
            "We had the most incredible girls weekend at Hotel X!  From the moment we checked in, we felt like royalty.  We stayed in the a corner suite with the most amazing views from all directions.  The living room style set up was perfect for lounging, relaxing and having a great catch up with friends.\\n\\nOur room had an incredible bathroom with a large soaker tub.  The water pressure in the stand up shower was incredible (always a bonus).  Just off of the washroom was a beautiful little vanity complete with cosmetic mirror and lights.\\n\\nThe concierge Stephen was AMAZING and so helpful in helping us select our restaurant for the evening.  As we were celebrating birthdays he also arranged for a beautiful surprise bottle of Rose to be sent up to our room.\\n\\nAfter a night on the town, we returned to our room and had the most incredible sleep!  Housekeeping had set up our pull out bed and the turndown service was lovely.  I have to say that the beds and bedding at Hotel X are top notch.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning we visited 10XTO, the beautiful luxury athletic club attached to the Hotel.  My girlfriend and I went to a Pilates reformer class with Joanna.  She was an amazing instructor and delivered an awesome class.\\n\\nFollowing our workout, we went to the Sky Bar for Lunch and took in the last moments of the breathtaking view.  We ordered one of each the Asian inspired appetizers (all delicious).\\n\\nIf you are looking for a 5 star experience for your next girls get away, Hotel X is the place to be.  We will absolutely be back!",
            "One of the most comfortable and exquisite hotels I have ever stayed in. The  Hospitality service upon check-in was excellent.  Nick made sure everything went smoothly and explained all that the hotel had to offer.  We were able to enjoy the roof-top pool, an amazing state of the art fitness facility, and a very comfortable room with a sunset view.  \\nWe ate dinner at Roses Cocina where the food was good, but the servers seemed to have needed a little more help.  It could have been just a busy night, but hopefully the next time we visit, this restaurant will have worked that out.\\nRoom service for breakfast came right on time and the food was delicious!\\nWe have since booked two more stays, with very special thanks to Edwin in reservations and Stephen, the Concierge",
            "This review is a little late in coming, but as they say, better late than never.... Hotel X... where do I start. Grandeur in size, exuberant in style and excellence in customer service.   My husband and I were there for our anniversary in December of 2019.   We loved the facility, there is so much to do.   It was everything we wanted and more for our anniversary.  A special thanks  to Director of Sales, Saira.  Her passion shines through, each time she talks about what the hotel has to offer.  If it wasn't for her we would not have enjoyed the hotel as much as we did.  Saira, is passionate about this facility and presents this to clients with great pride.  This library hotel is equipped with books everywhere, borrow a book from anywhere  in the hotel, take it to your room or the pool side and  enjoy it.  The hotel has a theatre, an art gallery, an all season outdoor pool, state of the art tennis court and gym...  The resturants and the VIP lounge offers great good selections. \\nIf you are visiting as a family, there is tons to do for the kids.  \\nWe loved our stay so much that we will be returning with our family soon. \\nOnce again thank you Saira for making our stay so memorable. Looking forward to coming back soon.",
            "My fiancee and I booked Hotel X as soon as lockdown was being lifted and it was the best decision we could have made. As someone who travels to countless of resorts for business - Hotel X truly reminded me of a destination resort. It was such an amazing escape from the day to day. The food, service and amenities are incomparable to other hotels in the city. Yuna & Matt went out of their way to make sure our stay was nothing less than perfect. We booked the pool with ease and had a great time at the rooftop pool. We had dinner at The Grill (you have to try to the flatbread!). It was such a great way to feel some normalcy during the pandemic and Hotel X made sure we felt safe and everything was always cleaned and sanitized. Our room had an incredible view and the comfiest bed. We can't wait to return next month -this is definitely now our go to staycation spot",
            "We had the best time :) The hotel and amenities are amazing. Everyone who works at the hotel is friendly and professional. Two random things: the shower has tremendous water pressure!!! and the ventilation system in the room is completely silent, for those who hate that type of noise. We would definitely stay again",
            "I was tasked with finding a hotel for our group in Toronto. Having never really spent time in the city (besides the airport), I chose based on location, price point, and reviews. We chose Hotel X, and were extremely glad we did. Modern, clean, professional\\u002Fhelpful staff, very upscale\\u2026plus Starbucks basically right in the hotel. All the things that I look for in a great hotel! We ended up booking adjoining rooms that had two queen beds in one, and a king bed, (large bathroom - two sinks) and living room in the other. Wow! Perfect for our needs! The large windows and views from our room of the water\\u002Fcity skyline were fantastic. We had only very minor issues, and not worth removing a star for, but I will mention in terms of feedback for the hotel. No ice available on the hotel floor, so you have to call down for ice. It\\u2019s not a huge deal, but we didn\\u2019t like having to bother staffers and wait for ice. Also, the rooms had a \\u201Cmain\\u201D light switch, that if you didn\\u2019t have on, meant the bathroom lights wouldn\\u2019t go on. This caused a bit of stress until we figured it out. Again, minor things, but this is an honest review. We didn\\u2019t take advantage of the cool things available in the hotel on this trip (screening room, Pilates, tennis court etc) but hope to next time. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at the restaurant Valerie on the hotels\\u2019 top floors - great sushi and atmosphere! Overall, we were very happy with the hotel and would definitely stay again",
            "Everything about this hotel was incredible. We went for a concert at the Budweiser Stage, which is across the street, so we saved all the time, stress, costs and hassle of getting to our event. What we saved on travelling around was worth spending extra for this hotel. Also only 18 minutes from the Pearson airport and across the street from the Billy Bishop. The rooms were clean with a big bathroom, large desk for eating (and a small table and chairs) - instead of having to eat on the beds. The staff were the most accommodating we\\u2019ve ever dealt with, and we travel a lot. Everything was accommodated quickly and kindly, and they treated the kids like gold. The rooftop pool is beautiful, the amenities plentiful - but the best part for my family was the Movie Screening Room. We booked in easily and watched Netflix on the big screen in the best chairs - and the staff even had popcorn waiting for us! I can\\u2019t say enough. An incredible experience with an outstanding hotel staff. Loved every minute \\uD83D\\uDC97 Thank you so much",
            "Hubby treated me to a night here for my birthday after the Toronto FC game, lovely hotel, super friendly check in staff. Got a surprise in the room for my birthday. Dinner in the restaurant was excellent with a great choice of food, the bass was delicious! We went in the rooftop pool in the evening, was amazing and warm, really enjoyed it despite it being minus 5 \\uD83D\\uDE01 Would definitely go back for a quick mini break in the city, had great vies of the CN tower and islands. Breakfast was great, we ordered room service and it arrived hot and fresh. Room was great, clean, spacious with everything we needed",
            "I really enjoy every stay I have at Hotel X, it is definitely my go-to place for staycations in Toronto because the property literally has everything you could ever ask for!  The rooftop pool is by far my favourite as it's never over-crowded (due to having reserved times) & the pool side drink service is always a lovely extra (shout out to Quincey who is so friendly and great!)  This stay we really enjoyed spending time in our room; which was impeccably clean and had a lovely view.  A special mention to Armhie from housekeeping who made us feel so incredibly special during our stay, she really went above and beyond and exceeded our expectations!  The front desk staff was so lovely and welcoming (Parnav was great!) and we really enjoyed Roses Social for brunch- special mentions to Starr and Harshit for their excellent customer service!  If you haven't tried the huevos rancheros dish at Roses you need to, it's the best! We will be back, thank you Hotel X",
            "What a great hotel! Terrific amenities and an incredibly friendly, responsive staff. We were in Room 1116 and had a beautiful view back on to downtown Toronto. The room was clean, they provided water daily, the coffee machine in the room was a Nespresso, etc. We needed extra pillows and they sent them up promptly. \\n\\nWe ate at all three dining options (Cafe X, Roses and Valerie) and had a good meal or snack at each. The views from Valerie are gorgeous!\\n\\nThe only downside, which is small in my opinion, is the beautiful pool area is small and, therefore, they limit the number of persons who can use it at any given time. During summer, you make a reservation for a two-hour block of time there. But, the view is stunning and again, the staff are great. \\n\\nWe had no trouble getting Ubers\\u002FLyfts. There is a shared bike rack right across the street. and the street cars stop nearby. In other words, we had no trouble getting anywhere. While not in the heart of the downtown area, you are so close that it is an easy walk, ride, or bike ride to get there.\\n\\nWe were here with family, ages 13-64, and we all enjoyed this stay. Highly recommend! And if we return to Toronto, this is where we will stay",
            "Do not stay here if you expect any service as a hotel guest. So unwelcoming and absolutely not worth the steep price. I\\u2019m from Toronto and paid for a one bedroom suite which cost just over $1000 for a bachelorette. Might as well have stayed at home.  I called room service to order 2 martinis and the lady on the other line said \\u201Cwe don\\u2019t do that\\u201D. When asked what that means she said they don\\u2019t provide alcohol, which is fine but she didn\\u2019t tell me what my options were since there was no in-room bar fridge. When pressed she stated that they only have \\u201Ccanned alcohol\\u201D and if I want a martini I should call the front desk and they can get one from one of the restaurants. Long story short, after about a dozen unanswered calls to front desk and guest services I was told they can\\u2019t help me and my best bet was to try to go to the restaurant myself and get the drinks. To be clear, they weren\\u2019t actually sure this would work. I also highly doubt the restaurant would allow me to walk around the hotel with 2 martinis\\u2026 \\n\\nI also booked the hotel solely for the pool which we basically couldn\\u2019t use. My checkout was at 12 but apparently I could only book the pool from 9-11 EVEN THOUGH checkout was at 12. They don\\u2019t stipulate this when you book the hotel unless it\\u2019s in MICRO print somewhere I didn\\u2019t see. We got there around 9:30 am and there were no lounge chairs. We had to sit on hard, uncomfortable patio chairs and were forced to leave at 11 am. \\n\\nDo not stay here and use you hard-earned money to go to a hotel that services their guests. \\",
            "Hotel is very nice and modern!  It is close to the Budweiser Concert venue so perfect if you are going to an event there.  There is not a lot else within a 10 minute walking distance and while you can walk several kilometers into downtown, easier to take an Uber which wasn't the most convenient.  Our room also overlooked a festival that was apparently happening that weekend and there was a DJ until midnight both nights.  It was very loud.  Elevators are also very fast!  The pool was crowded and much smaller than it looks online.  There are reservations but I don't think they were enforcing people to leave after their two hours time slot.  We had no room to sit when we were there as it was completely full (came up about 20 min into our 2 hour block).  Weather was a little cool so we decided not to stay.  Better management of the pool, letting guests know about the loud festival, and location to downtown would make this a 5 rating.  If we go back for a concert would definitely stay here a night but other than that would pick somewhere closer to downtown or the harbour area",
            "A family of 3, we stayed here both in 2018 and 2019 and so were very much looking forward to doing so again now the pandemic has allowed international travel. Once again it has been an outstanding experience. The staff are all courteous and helpful, the room is always spotlessly clean and well presented and the location across the way from Lake Ontario and the Budweiser Stage is wonderful. The facilities are incredible from a roof top pool to tennis courts, table tennis, basketball and even it's own cinema. On our next visit to Toronto from the UK, there is nowhere else we'll be staying. A special mention to MD Fariyal Hasham for his assistance before, during and after our stay",
            "Our check and check out were seamless.  The staff is unbelievable and so pleasant. It took a couple tries to get through to room service. I heard that from a few people.  The lights are bit complicated but once you figure them out no problem.  We were escorted to our room with our bags but the bellman did not go over the room ammenities and how the lights worked.  The rooms were well laid out but some of the furniture was showing its age. The beds were comfortable.  The hotel is beautiful has great views and tons to offer from gym facilities to tennis courts and a spa.  The location is not really accessible for walking or sightseeing you definitely need a car or ride share.  I am rating this hotel based on the staff and amenities. I think the rooms are completely over priced for what you get. You could stay and many other high end hotels for the same money that offer more in terms of locations and luxury.",
            "We stayed for two nights over the Easter long weekend and had a fabulous time. Very friendly staff. The concierge Steve stood out in particular - he is a true professional who paid special attention to ensure our kids had a great time! \\n\\nIt\\u2019s a beautiful modern hotel. We especially enjoyed the heated rooftop pool, spacious movie room with popcorn and drinks, access to the gym\\u002Ftennis\\u002Fracquetball, ping pong and basketball, and the kids play centre (small fee) that had sports, electronics, and arts. The concierge planned an Easter egg hunt for the kids which was a big hit! \\n\\nBreakfast was delicious! Next time we\\u2019ll take advantage of the Guerlain spa. I bought some perfumes which are exclusive and hard to find. The only downside was that the lounge was closed and the skybar is under renovations. It would have been nice to experience those amenities. But we had a fabulous time nonetheless and will be back",
            "Attended a work related conference at Hotel X.  Room was spacious, well appointed with amenities, very clean and had two very comfortable queen beds. My adult also travelled with me to the hotel, and when asked they were more than accommodating with a later check out for him and they also have a excellent departure lounge which made his wait for me to finish at 5:00 pm much more pleasent.  The hotel is very accessible by car and you have the choice of either valet or self parking which is not always available at a hotel of this level in Toronto.  Overall I highly recommend Hotel X and would definitely choose to stay here on my next trip to Toronto",
            "We arrived an hour and a half before check in as you need a reservation for the pool and we were hoping for some outside pool time before a concert.  We were told we could go at 7pm or 7am the next day.  Value for dollar I\\u2019ve had better rooms and better and consistent access to outdoor space at radisson blu down the road.  I\\u2019m disappointed for the price paid, I am essentially having to stay in my room.  Will not be staying here again, while the location is convenient to Budweiser Stage, not being able to use the only amenity I booked the hotel for (outdoor pool) has put a sour taste in my mouth.  If outdoor pool access is what you want, then save your money and book elsewhere",
            "We chose to stay here based on a friend's recommendation, and the service, amenities, food, views, and value were outstanding! We were in a junior suite, which was spacious, came with everything you could possibly need (robe, slippers, umbrella, etc), was absolutely silent on a Saturday\\u002FSunday night, and included access to the Library Lounge. We paid for breakfast at Maxx's on our first morning, and utilized the complimentary breakfast in the lounge on our second day. The staff were terrific, room service was great, all of the bars had great city views, the art gallery on the lower level was gorgeous, and the rooftop pool even has an accessibility chair to lower people into the water. They have truly thought of everything. It was too cold to enjoy the wraparound balcony but we look forward to coming back in better weather",
            "Honestly I had high hopes for Hotel X. From the outside looking in, 5 stars seems fitting. As a first time guest, i\\u2019ll tell you why I wouldn\\u2019t bother to stay here again. The actual rooms in the hotel favor a Marriott. No personality or character.  Food was a headache because there\\u2019s one restaurant with a mediocre selection and a cafe that closes whenever it wants. There was so many events happening during my stay it just felt like one big party from my room and i didn\\u2019t enjoy that. The staff was nice though. The gym isn\\u2019t the hotels gym but you can still use it and it\\u2019s designed to satisfy tennis players. You have to rent racquets if you wanna play on the court which is an additional charge. All the amenities from the theatre, to golf is going to cost you and is not included with what you paid. I\\u2019ve stayed in many hotels in toronto , this might not even crack my top 10.",
            "Hotel was lovely, rooms were clean, was a beautiful space, but very disappointed in guest experience.\\n\\nFelt as though we were unable to use most of the in-house complimentary amenities from the concierge car service to pool. Almost everything was booked up by the time we checked-in for our one night stay and the hotel was chosen specifically for what it offered. We were able to use the screening room which was great, but the room was clearly not cleaned before our reserved time as there was other guests trash throughout the space\\u002F all over the floor.\\n\\nGlad they\\u2019re investing in a second pool because for what was able to be reserved (an outdoor dining chair for 1 hour as other guests had thrown their towels on pool loungers when they were not needed) is not a relaxing or luxury hotel experience.\\n\\nPlease do better for your guests who are not there for\\u002F apart of weddings",
            "We had originally booked a room here for our wedding weekend in 2020. After postponing and eventually cancelling the big wedding, we weren't able to get a refund on the room so we used the excuse for a mini honeymoon. The service was excellent, all staff very friendly and responsive. The one bedroom suite was beautiful, with views of both the water and the city skyline. Booking reservations at the pool was efficient, as was reserving a table at the Falcon Sky bar.  We had drinks there on Friday night, great atmosphere, great DJ, only complaint was no drink menu to see a list of cocktails or have any idea of pricing. \\nFor a suite, I thought the bar area could have been a bit better equipped; the mini fridge is extremely small, not many glasses or extra utensils\\u002Fwine tools for entertaining. \\nLighting in the room was excellent, always appreciate dimmer switches! \\nWe tried to book the car service that drops guests off within a 5km radius of the hotel, however  it's not running due to Covid...this seemed a little strange as taxis\\u002FUbers are all operating with easy protocols in place. \\nThe rooftop pool is really nice, great views and limited capacity which means you can't stay for more than two hours but it doesn't get crowded which we appreciated. \\nOnly minor complaint would be that extended checkout is only 30 minutes, which doesn't make much of a difference. \\nOverall we had a great stay, very comfortable, clean and relaxing environment.  \\",
            "This is such a beautiful hotel and the perfect location to stay at it you are attending an event at Budweiser Garden.  The convenience can't be beat.  Imagine being back at your room ten minutes after the event ends?  Having stayed in downtown Toronto many times, this is my all time favourite Toronto Hotel.   I love staying near the water and the lakefront trails can't be beat.  Easily within a half hour walking distance to many neat restaurants and activities along the shore.  The hotel itself is very luxurious and the staff could not be nicer or more accommodating.  The rooftop pool is fantastic as is the hotel fitness centre!  Have been back many times and will return again",
            "Stayed here with our young kids for a staycation. Room (superior queen) was the perfect size and the view of the water and airport made the kids super happy. The in room amenities for the kids such as milk and desserts, balloons, stuffies and colouring pages were above and beyond to make their stay extra special. The kids play centre was great, well equipped with toys and video games, and the staff was very caring and attentive to the kids. The entire property was beautifully kept and well equipped with the pool, virtual golf, gym, etc. we didn\\u2019t use the gym much but it was probably one of the more impressive facilities I\\u2019ve seen anywhere. The pool was small (the indoor part; outdoor is much bigger) but the water was warm and we still enjoyed it. Service at the restaurant onsite was excellent, but I will note that it\\u2019s your only food option so there\\u2019s not a lot of variety. However, you can always order delivery so not a big deal. The concierges were always kind and helpful, and I will note that the manager Pranav went out of his way to help us book the room according to our needs, and ensure we had a good stay. The retro arcade room was really well done as well, we enjoyed using that. The rooms are very clean and everything is very up to date, I even noted the elevator buttons were self sanitizing! It\\u2019s 5 stars in terms of most aspects, not quite like the Ritz Carlton or ShangriLa, but this property was way more fun than those places and much better value. We would definitely stay again, and that\\u2019s really what matters",
            "Hotel X is relatively new property which offers probably the best combination of facilities and luxury in Toronto. Their sports complex is indoors and spread across 3 floors. It has tennis , golf , basketball , squash  . The main attraction is the roof top Pool terrace which has most amazing 360 views of the City overlooking the River , the Cityscape of downtown as well as distant sky scrapers . The Service at the rooftop restaurant could improve , usually understaffed. I would like to mention Mr Ady who managed to salvage a grave situation with his compassion and matured understanding of the hotel industry. I would recommend this hotel solely based on the fact that its people like him who are managing the affairs.\\nFood at Roses Cuccina - is the best I had in toronto in terms of taste , presentation , value for money as well as diverse flavors. Team a the restaurent are very warm and hospitable",
            "Hotel X is a dreamy, well designed hotel with excellent amenities. I fell in love with the design and decor of the public spaces of the hotel. My room was large, well appointed and had many great features: robes & slippers, Nespresso machine, automatic black out blind, good lighting, ample plugs and USB ports, an ultra comfortable bed and a nice sunset view. \\n\\nThe 24\\u002F7 fitness centre can\\u2019t be beat. I love that I was able to sign up for a hot yoga class too (additional charge).\\n\\nI liked the lake view. I didn\\u2019t try the restaurants but liked the Nespresso cafe and appreciated the convenience of the attached Starbucks. \\n\\nI stayed at this hotel for work while attending a conference at the beanfield centre so the location was unbeatable. I would definitely stay in this hotel again, especially if I don\\u2019t have a need to be right downtown. It\\u2019s worth nothing it\\u2019s a close walk to the island airport (and they have a free shuttle) for added convenience",
            "Paid over $500 for a one night stay and while the rooms were comfortable, had nice views and some of the staff we encountered we're friendly that's about where the good stops. The main reason a lot of people (including ourselves) book this hotel is because of the rooftop pool that floods all of their advertisements however what they fail to mention is that you only get one 2 hour time slot per stay to use the pool and you can't even pick your own hours you have to go with the times they offer, we were offered a 9a.m- 11a.m timeslot and when we were offered this it was already 10:15 a.m leaving us only 45 minutes to enjoy the pool, there is also no way to pre book your pool time before check in to prepare for this rule and no you are not allowed to stay and use it after check out either if you didn't get a chance during your stay.  We have stayed at many hotels in the city both luxury and budget friendly and have never had to book a pool slot (outside of covid) and not been allowed to stay and enjoy hotel amenities after check out. It's very clear that all this hotel cares about is taking as much money from their guests as possible without actually wanting to provide the service that should come with the steep price tag. If you're looking for a hotel in Toronto with a luxury feel who also have pools with amazing views and actually care about their guests I'd recommend the Sheraton Center or Fairmount",
            "Managed to sneak away with the hubby for a weekend at the end of last summer and had such an amazing time.  The views, staff and facilities were fantastic!  Was a little skeptical given the situation but felt immediately at ease from the moment we got there.  Staff was very attentive, and I really liked the added touch of being able to communicate everything through text message.  I needed extra towels and a facecloth and just texted.  So convenient!  Discovered later that they had tennis courts?  Wow, wish I knew beforehand so I could have brought the right shoes!\\n\\nNow I know and will definitely be back once this COVID stuff is done",
            "This is a phenomenal hotel and my preferred hotel whenever I visit Toronto. The second you walk in, you are greeted by a very clean signature scent and a breathtaking live wall. The service at the front desk is unmatched. The rooms are large, clean, modern and super comfortable. There are multiple restaurants available in house, which is very helpful in Toronto winters where you might not want to venture outside. The additional amenities (pool, golf, racquetball, Pilates studio and more) allow for team building activities and self care options when staying. Overall an amazing property.",
            "Absolutely fantastic hotel that, although pricey, provides an overall experience that justifies the extra expense.  This hotel has the most spectactlar athletic facilities we have ever seen in a hotel and the rooftop pool is wonderful (thoughfully designed with a partition that allows both indoor and outdoor use during winter).  Breakfast (not included in the room rate) at Roses Cafe was very good and reasonably priced for the quality.  The nearest streetcar station (509 & 511) is a 5 minute walk and the location is great for events at the Coca-Cola Coliseum and Convention Centre.  Staff were responsive and helpful.  We will definitely stay here again when back in Toronto",
            "Stayed two nights with a friend in a suite to attend a\\nbachelorette weekend. We specifically picked this\\nhotel to have a relaxing pool day Sunday at the end\\nof the weekend. \\n\\nCome to find out at check in amenities can not be used last check out (noon). Have been to several luxury resorts around the world and this is not consistent with those experiences. Have always been able to use the amenities after check out. Further, you may only book for a two hour window. Fine. They allow us to book the llam-1:00pm window. They inform us only guests on the reservation may use the pool, so we added the bride (who lives in Toronto) to the reservation for the Saturday night so she could join us by the pool Sunday. The hotel charged us $50 for this. We arrive promptly at 1lam for our two hour scheduled visit Sunday and there is not a single lounger for us to use. The bride needs an even tan for her wedding next weekend and had to lay towels on the ground to tan her back. See pictures for the kind of luxury pool experience you can expect at hotel X. How disappointing. Would\\nhave chosen a different hotel had we known all of\\nthe stipulations and complications of using the\\nrooftop pool. Even if you follow all the rules you'll still\\nend up tanning on the ground. There is a plethora of\\nspace up there the hotel should invest in 50 more\\nloungers and get ride of all the chairs",
            "Thanks to the great staff and accommodations at Hotel X my family enjoyed an amazing two-day winter break stay in Toronto. My teenage boys enjoyed the part-indoor, part-outdoor infinity pool on the 28th floor, even though it was January. The Aurora Winter Festival along the lake was amazing and a short walk from the hotel. The hotel was kind enough to provide comp tickets. We also received free tix to the Second City Improv performance at one of the two theaters in the hotel, which the entire family enjoyed. One of the my boys loves books and thoroughly enjoyed the library at the property. My boys also enjoyed the attached sports facility where we played basketball and ping pong and fitness center for free. Because we were celebrating my wife's birthday, the staff was also kind enough to surprise her with a special treat in our hotel room. We totally recommend adding the Library Club Lounge to your experience. The breakfast and happy hour and attentive staff are totally worth the extra expense. My wife also enjoyed her time at the onsite spa, where again the staff and treatment could not have been better. Hotel X was truly the highlight of our Toronto experience",
            "Stayed at this hotel in summer 2019.  Excellent service and amenities.  Location is also great for access to the Enercare Centre. Only recommendation is that guests be able to access the squash club during their stay",
            "I basically chose this hotel at such an off-centre location because it had a full gym with fitness centre, yoga classes, steam room and even tennis courts! However, surprise, surprise, steam room is only accessible to gym members. And, not surprisingly, yoga classes cost 25$ each and 47$ for the tennis courts. In the end, I simply used the fitness centre without being able to relax after my activities in the steam room. \\nThere are also steam rooms at the adjacent Guerlain spa but at the hefty price of 280$ for a 90-minute massage that is not even done by a regular massage therapist, so they won\\u2019t be giving receipts. Won\\u2019t be coming back. It is just not worthwhile",
            "I live in Toronto and selected this hotel to host a group weekend to celebrate an upcoming wedding. \\nI met 7 out-of-town guests on Friday. From the moment we pulled up until we checked out, the staff was authentically courteous. \\nThe hotel exceeded my expectations from the website and online photos. \\nWe used a number of the amenities during our 2 night stay. \\nHot yoga, gym equipment, pool and steam rooms were enjoyed the first day. The pool is partially indoors with access (swim under the glass divider) to the outdoor pool. It is fully heated and we swam outside during the snowstorm!  The indoor pool is very limited for space. Most of the pool space is outdoor.  \\nWe had the package that included 4:30 wine and cheese as well as the continental breakfast. Both services were superb. \\nWith our own curiosity tour, we saw the multiple squash courts, the 10XTO fitness facilities and dined in Maxx's restaurant. All amenities impressed everyone in our group. \\nWe had free self parking and it was very easy and hassle free access to the hotel elevator. \\nEvery employee, no matter what part of the hotel you were in, had a smile and were eager to help however needed. \\nYou can certainly come here and have no reason to leave if you're looking for a getaway to chill and treat yourself. \\nI live 15 min away and plan to book family Staycations in the near future."

            "The front desk check in, cleanliness, location, sleep quality and quality of the room were excellent as expected from Best Western brand. Where it differed was in value. Price per night was at high end compared to other hotels and offered far less amenities. \\n\\nNote that every Best Western is independently owned and operated. This particular location does not offer any continental breakfast and charges $3 for a very small cup of coffee in the lobby. There is limited parking and no outdoor parking if you have a larger vehicle. We chose this location for the Stay, Park & Fly package but they could not accommodate our vehicle.\\n\\nTatiana the front desk person was able to quickly locate an alternative parking for us to try at the regular Airport Park & Fly lot and arranged for us to get a shuttle back to the hotel via the airport once we parked there.\\n\\nIt did not appear that the gym or pool were available either but even if they were by the time we got the parking sorted out it was quite late and we had to be awake at 5 a.m. the next morning.\\n\\nIf you don't have a larger vehicle and don't need any amenities this is a great place to stay. Only because the price we paid for the night was high and the amenities low I am rating VALUE as low on this chart. Otherwise the room was extremely clean and comfortable and staff very helpful and friendly",
            "This was in a strange location without a car, really nothing around. The room was very nice in a very new hotel, very comfy. The pool area was ok with a nice small gym as well. One disappointment was no breakfast like we traditionally are used o at most best westerns",
            "This Best Western is a very well designed and appointed property. Our room was well appointed and the bathroom had a walk-in shower.\\nThe restaurant offered a great menu and the food was excellent.\\nExtended parking is also available. We will definately stay here agai",
            "Room was very clean and price was reasonable. On site long term parking was also reasonable. Shuttle service to the airport was on-time. On-site restaurant served good food at a good price and service was excellent. We would book this hotel again for a future stay when flying out of Pearson.",
            "We like to stay close to YYZ for our flights and as we had an early morning flight this was perfect. We stay the night before our flight and this was the first time we stayed at this property. We booked on Expedia and paid $ 207.99 taxes in with our CAA membership. The property was clean and modern and was close to3 or 4 places to eat within walking distance and within the hotel itself. It had a pool and fitness centre and for those who like plane watching you can\\u2019t get any better. What stood out about this hotel was the customer service. From entering the property to checkout the staff was excellent. We will book this hotel again and would recommend it highly",
            "Take the airport shuttle from the airport if that's how you are coming in to avoid the ridiculous minimum cost of taxis (it's only a ten minute drive and they charge more than forty bucks). The room is solid and clean, and desk staff SUPERB at dealing with your short stay. One of the best airport hotels I've been to in Canada period",
            "Staying during mandatory hotel quarantine. Loved having a microwave and fridge available to me. All other amenities were good, bed, bathroom ect. Food quality was mediocre but plentiful.  Would have been nice to be given a choice between meals (the meat and vegetarian option for example)",
            "It was really nice to stay in a place that resembled the pictures they advertise on the Internet. I can\\u2019t say enough good things about my experience at this location. Highly recommend it! The staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home, the facilities are clean and inviting, and it was perfect location for myself and my husband to get to the airport and for my business meeting at the Congress centre",
            "We recently took a trip out of Toronto and needed an park n fly hotel.  Our travel agent suggested the BW Premier Carlingview.  We had never used this hotel before but she said we should give it a try.\\n\\nThe hotel was very nice, quiet, had lots of amenities and a very good bar\\u002Frestaurant.  What we appreciated the most though was the covered parking.  Any one leaving on a winter vacation knows the value of coming home and not having to clean off your car while not dressed properly.  \\n\\nThe other major reason we loved this airport was the shuttle.  It is a 24 hour shuttle and it goes directly to the airport and does not stop to pick up others from additional hotels.  That is important when you have to be up at crazy hours and are in a hurry.  The price was very reasonable too so you really have no reason not to try BW Carlingview",
            "Staff was especially welcoming and friendly. Our room was clean and dog friendly.\\n\\nBut we caught this hotel at a bad time. There were two elevators for guests but one was not working when we arrived. Then the second one failed as well. The security people in the lobby helped guests to find the service elevator to go up but any guest on the fifth floor who had baggage and a child was left wondering how to go down. Signs would have helped them. \\n\\nThe HVAC in our room did not work and neither did our coffee maker. Coffee in the lobby cost $3\\u002Fcup.\\n\\nDespite being next to the airport rooms seemed well soundproofed",
            "Stayed at the Best Western Premier for one night before an early morning flight at yyz. Booked \\nA room with 2 queen beds and the price was good for 3 people. Clean, fast and friendly service and close to YYZ. Tips when booking this hotel included close to Parknfly, close to Airzona bar and grill with good food at good prices and if you like plane spotting this hotel is for you. Overall the property is quiet, clean and the staff were excellent. Will be back",
            "I love this hotel. Perfect rooms, prefect parking. Everything is amazing when you stay in this hotel close to Pearson airport. They offer 15 days parking package for traveling. Rooms are well decorated, modern and clean. Breakfast and amenities better than any other hotel in the area.",
            "A lot of partying going on. Just needed a place to sleep near the airport in between flights. Sleep was minimal, doors slamming all night, loud guests. Vomit outside the exit doors, could have been much cleaner. Definitely won\\u2019t stay there again if I plan on actually sleeping",
            "We stayed for one night for a layover. Shuttle pick up at the airport was quick and drop off at the airport was scheduled. Staff was friendly and treated us well. Food at the restaurant was average but I would stay here again and recommend it for short stays",
            "After travelling many years, this hotel hit the mark in all areas: helpfulness, check-in, cleanliness, restaurant, location (for my needs) and exceptional staff.  The two gentlemen at reception were outstanding. They were patient, informative and had a sense of humour. I would highly recommend this hotel",
            "Good choice for air travel. The hotel is convenient for a stay before or after a flight and the shuttle service works well. It's handy to have a restaurant on site. The rooms were clean and the staff great. We have stayed at Best Western, Carlingview many times and will again",
            "The staff are lovely at the hotel and extremely helpful.  The room was clean and basic. It is right on a flight path, but the noise is not noticeable at night. \\nParking is covered so problematic if you drive a larger vehicle such as a pick-up truck. No other options nearby to park. \\nThe restaurant is good and their staff helpful but has limited choices. This makes it difficult for those who have food restrictions. \\nThe Internet is slow, and TV is a little baffling regarding figuring out channels but that could be me not figuring it out properly. \\nIt is a pleasant hotel with courteous staff. Very responsive to communications as well.",
            "Stayed here recently and my review is mixed.\\nThe room is clean and bright and overhead air traffic is not a problem. Front desk staff are friendly and helpful.\\nDisappointed in the parking availability. Definitely not something you can bet on. Internet and tv were down for the majority of the time is a major disruption when you\\u2019re travelling for business and need to connect. The restaurant is handy but overall you\\u2019d be better off elsewhere.\\nDon\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll choose this property again",
            "The staff on duty in the best personnel any organization can wish for. Very passionate about work and very professional at receiving guests and helping them settle-in. The building is well maintained and reasonably close to the airport. Hotel also has a great airport shuttle services which helps you save some money on taxi. I will certainly stay at this hotel the next time I am flying through Pearsons int'l",
            "I stayed here for business travel during COVID-19, during an extended overnight flight layover and it did the job. The hotel was clean, check-in was quick and it's less than a 5 minute \\u00DCber ride from Terminal 3. My room faced the airport which meant I could hear the low rumble of aircraft taking off during the night but it wasn't that bad that it bothered me.\\n\\nThere are two things I base a hotel recommendation on; a comfortable bed and a nice shower with excellent water pressure, and this hotel had both of those. The TV was also wall mounted and larger than most hotel room TV's, which I appreciated. The coffee maker used the pod system, so if you are staying here for an extended period, you could use your own pods or a refillable one. The coffee was quite good, but I can't remember the brand they use.\\n\\nDue to COVID, all their other services and ammenities like the free breakfast and the gym, were closed, so I'm unable to comment on any of those. I would stay here again without hesitation",
            "This is a great place to stay when you need to be near Pearson. I booked mainly for the free airport shuttle (takes 5 minutes to get to the terminal) and the economical room rate. I was happy with the room - nicely updated with a really comfy bed and great walk-in shower. Restaurant was closed for supper but there are options just down the street. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the restaurant was fast, tasty and not overpriced. This hotel does what it's supposed to do, and does it well.",
            "This lovely hotel is close to the airport and has everything you need to make your stay and enjoyable one. The rooms a clean and spacious. The Staff are kind and helpful. The Flight Path restaurant serves delicious meals from incredible servers. The pool and fitness areas a clean and have great hours. There's covered (paid) parking (great for Canadian winters) and a shuttle to the airport (free) should you need it. Great stay - we highly recommend it...plus, the price was just right!.",
            "Why is someone vacuuming right outside my door at 9:30pm? lol This hotel isn't bad. I didn't eat there, but there's a restaurant (looks kind of boring) called The Flight Path. That makes sense because this hotel is right under the flight path to the Toronto airport. So every 5 minutes a very loud plane goes by and sounds like it may land on me. I read other reviews before booking here that said it was so quiet and they couldn't hear a thing, but not my room haha. It could be worse though, could be trains instead of planes I guess. All in all, I'm happy. I feel comfortable. Staff is nice, room is clean. Pool and area is lackluster. There's a free shuttle that takes you directly to the airport, so we'll see how that goes in the morning :",
            "Decently priced and close to the airport which is what we needed.  Thankfully they had a shuttle running early morning which was really convenient.  We had a domestic flight at 6:45am so we had to be at the airport by 5ish.  They had shuttles running even at 4am.  We got on the 5am shuttle which got us there in plenty of time for us to drop off our bags and catch our flight. Sleep wasn\\u2019t the greatest but that is likely due to anticipation of getting up on time.  The room temp could have been a better.  We had the ac running all night and found the room a bit stuffy\\u002Fhumid still.  Staff was lovely and friendly.",
            "It\\u2019s an ok hotel. There are better close by. I was here on business, the staff were friendly for the most part. As my employer was paying for the hotel costs, I did not have much of an option. They tried to get me to give them my personal credit card for the security deposit. I explained that they had a card on file and they could use that for the deposit. After some discussion they figured it out and I went on my way. There were a few families living at the hotel and although they were noisy in the early evening but by 9 pm quieted down. Due to Covid protocols there was no room service, but I could call to the front desk if I needed anything.\\nEveryone was friendly including the 2 security guards working the front lobby.\\nThe room was clean, except for the coffee maker, which I decided not to use as it looked like it had seen better days. The refrigerator worked well and kept my stuff cold. \\nWhen I checked in they told me the restaurant would be open for breakfast, but I did not use the restaurant for any meals.\\nOverall it\\u2019s not bad, I have stayed in worse hotels. Next time I might try a hotel that is closer to restaurants",
            "Nice hotel. Stayed here for 1 night after arriving at midnight form a flight. Just 7 min away from the airport. There is a shuttle service running every 30 min during the morning and every 1 hour during the evening. I believe that they should maintain a 30 min frequency all day long, as I had an evening flight and had to wait almost an hour for the next van to leave. Rooms are big and wifi service is quite fast. My room was clean as well as all the hotel common areas",
            "Stayed here on two occasions, both for an overnight layover. For needing a place to eat, shower and sleep it is a nice option. \\n\\nRooms, specifically the showers, could get a better cleaning but overall it was good. \\n\\nShuttle service was fast and very convenient.",
            "Incredible, friendly service. Great food & bar. From the front desk to the bartender, we felt so welcome. The bed was very, very comfortable The entire decor and interior was upscale.This hotel was the finest Best Western we have ever stayed in",
            "Our new spot to park, stay and fly in the Toronto airport area.  Friendly check-in. \\nRooms clean, reasonable size, quiet for the area.  Location close to airport and easy to get to.  There is a restaurant on site, also on site covered parking (i.e. ramps) with access to hotel.  Shuttle service totally fine.  \\n\\nThis was our first stay (of two nights - going and returning) but will not be our last",
            "It was a very pleasant stay. Check in staff very friendly and helpful! Rooms were very clean and updated \\nVery convenient having the fridge , microwave and mini coffee machine.\\nI have one suggestion that is it would be great if you offered bottled water to guest on arrival",
            "Stayed here for 2 nights unexpectedly because my flight home was delayed. Very happy I randomly chose this place - I wanted something budget friendly and didn\\u2019t need extra frills or anything. All the staff I spoke to were friendly and helpful, restaurant\\u2019s food was good, beds were comfy, room was clean. No complaints! I\\u2019d stay here again. The airport shuttle every 30 mins was very convenient too.",
            "I stayed in room 319, and while the decor was a tiny bit dated, the bed was very comfortable, the black-out curtains were amazing, and the staff and restaurant really made this stay very enjoyable.  I appreciated the fact that the lady at the desk helped me with my luggage, given that i use a mobility aid, and had been struggling a little bit.  Oh, and the room i was in was an accessible one, with the roll-in shower, and accessibility bars, etc.  I was right around the corner from the vending machine, so that was a great perk as well.  The room appeared to be relatively soundproof, and I barely heard the planes, so my sleep was quite restful",
            "They advertise room service but make you come down to get it. Even though I use a cane. Shuttle driver took me to the wrong terminal, caused me a lot of physical pain and I was in danger of missing my flight. It takes a person with mobility issues longer to get around an airport.",
            "I was surprised and disappointed at the poor service from the staff and the poor cleanliness of the room, having stayed at hotels near airports quite a few times before around the world. Please note that there are 3 different airport hotels, and they do have a business card at the front desk which clarifies the locations for the shuttles! I really would have liked not to have problems, considering I had an early start the morning after my first night - I didn't get breakfast vouchers until I asked for them, although I paid the breakfast rate, and didn't learn about them and what's included until I overheard from other diners in the restaurant. Please bear in mind that there will be loud banging of doors and talking outside your room at all hours of the night",
            "This hotel is not the most chic but it is very clean and mere minutes from the airport. I live two hours from the airport and loathe the idea of delving into airport traffic. Travelling is hectic enough! This hotel offers a one night stay rate with $10\\u002Fday parking for your trip and a free shuttle that keeps you out of the airport melee. It is really a great solution and the staff are helpful, solicitous and courteous",
            "We stayed here so I could drop my wife off at the airport. Literally a five minute drive. Room was great. Restaurant was cozy and had great service, great food and good value. Parking is limited and you have to pay extra for it.",
            "Staff are always friendly and helpful.  Nice it is only a 10 minute ride on the shuttle to the airport.  The restaurant staff are friendly and kudos to the chef,  food always tastes wonderful!  We also love the covered parking for our vehicle",
            "Clean, modern and welcoming hotel; great stay, park and fly packages.  Free shuttle to and from airport.  Covered parking lot!  No snow to shovel off when arriving home from winter break. Fabulous amenities. Staff is excellent and very welcoming.",
            "The staff is pleasant and helpful at this location.  Shuttle driver is helpful with bags and safe drive.  The cost is a bit high, but location is convenient near the airport and parking available reasonabl",
            "Best Western is very close to airport. Staff were very courteous. Hotel was very clean. Room was clean, roomy & bed comfortable. We ate at hotel eatery hostess was very nice and food was good. Airport shuttle is available",
            "The check in was efficient. Had to fill out a small form re the parked car. I was only in the room a scant 12 hours. Its colours are eclectic. My room overlooked the entrance area, catching the evening sun. The room temperature was set at a very pleasant 70F\\u002F21C. Had a large bed. It was, however, a poor sleep. Duvets and I just do not get along. Never tried the television. There was a closet which held a small safe, iron and ironing board. I did not use the microwave. The coffee maker was simple to use but the coffee itself rather weak. A little fridge could be found beneath the microwave. There were two comfortable chairs, one traditional, the other on wheels. Almost had to go downstairs re the wifi but it eventually connected and was fine thereafter. An ice bucket is another nice touch. The property is just five minutes from the airport. You pay a bit more for location [just over $212 Cdn included a parking fee]. It seemed rather busy but the floor was quiet. The bathroom was clean. I liked having actual toiletries. The shower was good. There were plenty of towels and a hair dryer. All in all, it is a nice property but I was not well rested before the flight",
            "After flying in from Mexico early as a result of Covid-19 it was good to be back in Canada. The front desk was staffed appropiately and precautions were in place. Although the dining room was closed take-out establishment names were available, as well as a cooler with sandwiches,beverages and yogart for sale. I requested a room close to the elevator as I was walking with a cane and have  a bad knee. The shuttle driver  on both trips to airport was friendly and extremely helpful",
            "Excellent stopover going and coming from a trip.  Covered garage is a plus.  Front desk are so friendly, laid back and helpful.  Restaurant is simple, has great food and staff are also very friendly.  Rooms have been updated, are very clean and bed and pillows ate so comfortable.  Rooms have fridge, microwave and coffee maker.  We have been here before and will return again.

I would suggest they tell you that up front so you understand that when your card is charged.\\nShuttle is prompt and courteous.\\n\\",
            "We booked here again, along with a friend because of the free parking and shuttle to the airport.  In addition, the rooms are clean, and they have a nice little restaurant on site.\\n\\nGood service, pleasant staff, and easy to get to.\\n\\nOh... and one of the most comfortable beds we\\u2019ve ever slept in",
            "Needed location near airport for early flight with free shuttle to same. Best Western is a reasonably priced brand I know I can trust.  I was very impressed with modern d\\u00E9cor of  room and bathroom  AND individual shampoo\\u002Fconditioner- so hard to find these days.  They really got it right with a shower cap and make-up remover towelette.  Bed was extremely comfortable.   The room and bathroom were  sparkling clean.  Keurig coffee machine was a nice touch.  Definitely recommend this hotel. Due to covid didn't use pool\\u002Ftub.",
            "This was a nice, clean hotel. Close to the airport, with shuttle service. Our room was spacious and included a King sized bed, walk-in shower, mini fridge, and microwave. We were a bit worried about our quality of sleep, being so close to the airport but we slept very well and didn\\u2019t notice the noise of the planes taking off\\u002Flanding. Our only issue was that both elevators weren\\u2019t working when we came in after dinner. There are no indoor staircases, which was odd. A staff member brought us up to our floor, using the staff elevator, so it wasn\\u2019t a big deal. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for anyone needing a place to stay, close to the airport. I should also add that the front desk staff were very friendly and welcoming",
            "We have stayed here 3 times in 2020. We stay here every year as you can get your room, 1 to 2 weeks covered parking while you are away. They have a shuttle that takes you to and from the airport. They also have a restaurant on site which is only average but you can park your car, check in to your room and then go down with out having to go outside and eat. Makes every thing so much simply",
            "I like this location because it is close ( 1 block)  to an Enterprise car rental that is outside the airport. That way I can save hundreds on picking up a rental car. I fly in to Toronto , take the hotel shuttle over and then walk up to the Enterpise. If you arrive late there are 2 restaurants 2-3 blocks from the hotel, that are open til after 12am",
            "Hotel is close to Airport, morning staff were friendly.\\nRestaurant at this hotel had a good selection.\\nMeeting room was comfortable and nicely laid out.\\nCoffee in the lobby cost $2.00, and nice selection of snacks available at the front desk",
            "Very clean room, excellent service in restaurant.  Covered Parking. Great for against the elements. One of the closest to the airport for a park, fly, stay scenario. You can stay either at the beginning or end of your trip. Shuttle to the airport is included"

Bed and Sofa bed was comfortable for our girls. The pool and the hot tub were very enjoyable. Breakfast in the morning was good and convenient. Staff was great and helpful.\\nWould return to this hotel every time in Toronto, attending consumer shows at the International center or when departing on trip from Toronto  Pearson Airport.\\nGreat value",
            "We stayed here while picking up a family member in the airport.  We used the 888 number to reserve and not the direct line to the hotel.  We reserved a king suite with a rollaway bed.  Upon arrival noticed it was not in the room.  The front desk informed us they don't even have rollaway beds and couldn't understand why we were told that.  We were offered extra linens which we took as one of us had to sleep on the floor.  The girls were up to their eyeballs with problems it seemed as it was caribana weekend and the hotel was full.  We stayed downtown before and while it is a nicer property, for the price and breakfast for 4 we were happy.  I think being a Marriott the communication around the sleeping should have not have happened and perhaps free parking could have been offered for the false info.  It. Was also not a king bed as advertised but again, the value was great!! If traveling with more than 2 it is a good hotel.",
            "We stayed here for the night after coming home from a trip.  The hotel staff were very friendly and went out of there way to make sure you were happy.  The rooms were a good size and everything was very clean.  We used the high speed internet and had no issues at all with it, it was nice and speedy and very easy to connect up.  The breakfast in the morning also good, they had a very good variety available.  \\n\\nWe would stay at this hotel again without any problems",
            "Very clean.  Nicely decorated.  Nice staff.  We got the last room supposedly.  Stopped in during a road trip.  Was advised by the AAA manual that this was a decent place to stay.  The price was originally 175.00 but reduced to 145.00 Canadian.  Serving party sandwiches for dinner that night-did not try but breakfast was a winner.  Lots of choices both hot and cold including sausage, eggs, toast, pastries, juice, coffee, etc.  Decent treadmill in the small exercise room.  My daughter loved the pool.  We enjoyed the basketball court outside.\\",
            "I believe in giving credit when credit is due and this hotel deserves alot. Went to Toronto to celebrate our 33rd anniversary and for theater downtown. Unlike years ago, hotel prices in the city are outrageous and deals can't be found. Previous reviews for this hotel have been great and this was enough for us. All services by hotel staff were done with a smile everytime. Check-in was a pleasure and the separate 1 bedroom room was superb. Every dish, glass and utensil was clean and waiting for use. The swimming pool was neither hot nor cold. Just cool enough to be refreshing. The whirlpool was plently warm enough. Several restaurants including Montana's Bar and Grill, Tony Roma's, Tucker's MarketPlace and Boston Pizza are across from the hotel and there is no need to drive. We ate at Ton'y Roma's and with the tip spent $80. There are no cheap places to eat. The drive to downtown is about 18 miles if going via the 401 then down Yonge Street. A better choice might be the TTC from the Yorkdale Mall. Cost is $2.25 per person each way if you buy at least 10 tokens at the mall entrance to the train. Parking at the mall is free and safe. Entire area is patrolled by security. We were out until 11:30 pm at there was still plenty of activity in the area. Always felt safe and the parking garage is brightly lit. Be sure and research the drive to and from the hotel as the traffic in Toronto is unbeliveable.\\nThis hotel and it's staff exceeded our expectations and we will stay here again",

My wife and kids needed to quickly meet me at airport.  The staff and shuttle driver were incredibly helpful coordinating shuttle with my wife who was packing in room. Staff helped load all luggage (multiple suitcases & car seats) onto cart, brought down and quickly\\u002Fsafely got them to meet me at airport with ongoing communication. The hotel was fine but the staff, particularly Krista at front desk, is why we so highly recommend as everyone was most helpful and accommodating. Such wonderful service should be celebrated. Also refunded unused 2nd night points",

We had read about the hot buffet breakfast but weren't expecting too much, so we were pleasantly surprised to find such a selection.  The light supper provided from Monday to Thursday evenings was also delicious - we felt like we were at an all-inclusive.  Suite was lovely, staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, couldn't ask for anything more",
            "Second time at this hotel for a hockey tournament and we'll be back next month too. Spacious rooms, some with full kitchens. Our two bedroom suite was ideal. The included breakfast leaves a  little to be desired but it got us fed before we left for the rink. Pool and outdoor basketball court help keep the kids amused. Many restaurants within a kilometre and access to the 401 is a minute away",
            "Recently, my husband & I stayed at the Residence Inn Toronto Airport.  As part of their Stop-over package,  we could leave our car at the hotel, until we returned from our vacation.  During the week we were away, our car was stolen from the hotel's parking lot.\\n\\nIt was quite a shock to realize that our car was missing.  The apathy of the hotel was very disappointing.  They made it very clear that this was NOT their problem.\\n\\nMy husband had been concientious to park the car under a light, and yet still it was stolen. \\n\\n As there is no outside surveilance, the hotel again accepted NO LIABILITY.   We were told that, perhaps on a future visit, they might be  able to offer us a lower rate.\\n\\nAll in all, a very frustrating experience.  We will never again make the mistake to utilize Residence Inn as a stop-over hotel.  A very expensive lesson learned",
            "Was disappointed upon arrival at this Marriott hotel.  As one who uses his Marriott rewards and typically only stays at Marriott properties, I was rather disappointed. \\n\\nUpon arrival looks very old and tired.  Hallways and entrance are small. Room is small. One bedroom King bed. \\n\\nFront staff often were busy doing something out of sight from the front desk.  My request on my mobile app was not done.  Too late at night so I did without. \\n\\nSleep was okay.  Room was clean. Something I\\u2019d expect from a category 1 or 2 hotel from Marriott and not a category 4. \\n\\nNext time it\\u2019ll be the Airport Marriott or the Courtyard Airport.",
            "We stayed only one night at the Residence Inn before our flight out to Vancouver the next morning. Our check in took a little longer than expected but the complimentary cookies at the front desk made up for it. The suite had a kitchenette, dining area, living area, desk and seperate bedroom. The hotel is fairly new so everything was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable with a lovely duvet and plush pillows. The complimentary breakfast and internet were a definate plus! Would definalty stay there again.\\",
            "Last Christmas vacation me and my family stayed in their on of kitchenette suites and we found very enjoyable and great services. Morning breakfast was too goo with too many varieties. We stayed in this hotel because it is very convenient to all our relatives and friends places.\\nThanks and we back again",
            "Stayed here for 4 days. Great price! Ample parking space (they charge for it). Decent buffet and good staff. Room was comfortable. It is a half hour drive to downtown Toronto. There are good restaurant and grocery options around this property, and also a mall.",
            "We love this hotel, very spacious, nice pictures and bathroom deco.  The view of the landing aircrafts is also a nice plus for couples who have young kids.  Highly recommend it. (not bad for someone who is very picky, along with picky family members who usually find reasons to disagree with my hotel choices :)\\n\\nIf you need to order Chinese food, Gourmet Express can deliver to the room, great food at very reasonable prices.\\",
            "To be honest when I first came to this hotel I had absolutely no expectations and was a little disappointed in the exterior look of the hotel. However today is my last day and I can't tell you how amazing this stay has been and how incredible the staff here are during my time here. I've never been at a hotel where every single staff member from every area of the business is so wonderful and nice and happy. They always smile and say hello whenever we cross paths and that means so much when you're staying alone. Jason at the front counter I'd unbelievably friendly, helpful, and kind. I absolutely hope he gets recognized for his amazing customer service. The rooms are spacious, I loved the kitchen with microwave, fridge, freezer, and utensils! Makes it easy to bring and heat up any leftovers. The rooms are clean and well kept. I couldn't have asked for more during my stay here and I'll recommend this hotel to all my friends.",
            "I stayed in this hotel for two days . Firstly there is nothing around the hotel . Only few restaurants and nothing more to spend tiime. The closest shopping area is 10 minutes with taxi but you have to pay 25 dollars .\\nThe hotel room was nice especially for families with its kitchen equipment Bed is comfortable but when it comes to bathroom amenities and cleaniliness its lower then marriott standars. Especially there was a towel thorn from sides and I warned the front desk they said ohhh how can it happen but the other day it was still there . And after breakfast I warned front desk personally but until my stay finished the thorned towel was still there . \\nShortly It is a standard family hotel with no great luxury and with an avarage breakfast.And in the middle of nowhere . At the beginning it seems cheaper according to downtown hotels but i\\u015Ff you want to buy somthing or entertain you should pay a lot of taxi fares",
            "The rooms were nice and open but the furniture is outdated. I thought the price was good. We got a 2 bedroom suite for 152 bucks for one night however on the receipt there was 3 separate charges for HST and another charge for 5 bucks which was ridiculous, in addition they charge 10 bucks for parking! so the room ended up costing 190 bucks! Thats a little outrageous. The eating area for the included breakfast is very tiny so be prepared to take your food to your room oh and its only available between 6:30am and 9:30am which is STUPID for a saturday. Its close to the airport so expect alot of travelers at the hotel it wasn't quite by any means. A suggestion to the hotel take that 10 parking fee you rip your customers off for and put it into a fund to level out your parking lot its horrible literally! One more thing id like to mention is that this is a residence inn therefor people are usually staying for an extended period of time so its a good idea to have sufficient utensils. Only provided one tiny steak knife! I did not find the staff accommodating, friendly or helpful in anyway. The lady that checked me in should maybe look for a job elsewhere because she was not warm in welcoming in anyway. I have stayed at many Marriott's and this is by far the biggest disappointment for a Marriott",
            "Have stayed here frequently most recently twice in December 2013. The rooms are clean and spacious. The staff are great. Always friendly and very helpful.\\nMy only two complaints:1. They now charge $10  for parking which used to be included. Many others in the airport area like the Hampton\\u002FHomewood Suites on Eglington do not charge. 2.The breakfast is generally quite good but ends at 9 (or 930 on  weekends) and  we often miss it if we sleep in",
            "J'ai s\\u00E9journ\\u00E9 il y a quelques temps dans cet h\\u00F4tel. Proximit\\u00E9 avec l'a\\u00E9roport, petit d\\u00E9jeuner correct, chambre spacieuse et bien \\u00E9quip\\u00E9e, par contre environnement peu attractif mais c'est normal. B\\u00E9mol, gros probl\\u00E8mes d'isolation phonique et personnel peu r\\u00E9actif. Loin du centre ville mais l'h\\u00F4tel peut vous orienter vers un service de taxi tr\\u00E8s comp\\u00E9titif pour les prix.\\nIn fine, bien sans plus mais bon rapport qualit\\u00E9 prix",
            "I stayed there during a family weekend. Everything was great. Park and walk to anything you want. We went to restaurants  sporting events and shopping. The hotel is nice and comfortable. We will go back",
            "L'h\\u00F4tel est situ\\u00E9 pr\\u00E8s de l'a\\u00E9roport mais au niveau insonorisation, rien \\u00E0 dire.

Il y a une piscine int\\u00E9rieure et un terrain de basket ext\\u00E9rieur. Il existe un shuttle gratuit vers l'a\\u00E9roport. Je recommande sans h\\u00E9siter. Bon rapport qualit\\u00E9\\u002Fprix",
            "This hotel really met my needs.  I was passing through Toronto meeting up with family before heading to Europe on vacation. We got a 2 bedroom, which had a pull out bed in the living room.  It was just what we needed. \\n\\nThe pool and hot tub are nice, and there was even a tennis court with a basketball net that was great for my nephews and niece. There are also complimentary computers for internet access near the lobby. \\n\\nIf you are looking to visit Toronto, this hotel is a bit far from areas of interest. It is close to the airport, offers a complimentary shuttle and parking is free. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. In fact, we liked it so much we booked there again for our return two weeks later",
            "Okay, so there were good and bad things about this hotel.  \\nThe GOOD.  \\n-staff was fantastic, from the cleaning ladies and maintenance guys up, everyone really went out of their way to make sure everything was okay.\\n-other guests, we met more than a few people at the hotel and everyone was very friendly, sometimes at the 'higher end' hotels people can be really snotty.\\n-the cleanliness.  I don't think I saw a speck of dirt.  And believe me, I look!  Corners of ceilings in the lobby to the claw feet on the tables in the hall, no dust.  Pretty impressive.\\nThe BAD.\\n-the room is smaller than you think it will be, it was adequate, but not what I expected.\\n-the sofabed...oh....my.  Seriously, if you love the people you travel with, you won't expect them to sleep on this hammock.  We padded it with the (hideous) coverlet and 3 blankets.  Didn't really help.  Also, the sheets they provide for it are see through.\\n-the blankets.  Before we realized that we'd need a blanket to pad the bed, we thought we'd need it to sleep.  Still not sure if they were made of velcro or sandpaper.  Had to go down and ask for the same blanket (duvet) that they put on the beds.  Luckily, I've already made my comment about great staff.\\n-pillows and bed.  How did they raise the floor like that?  Very hard.  Hard pillows?  Yes, both the feather and the foam.\\n\\nThe hotel has a VERY dated feel to it.  It reminds me of the 70's, when you'd travel with the whole family.  There's even a barbecue outside!  The pool is bromine, which is kind of a salt\\u002Fchlorine combo, it's okay, but pretty drying on the skin.  I expected the pool area to be full of kids, but it wasn't bad at all.  The gym is quite nicely equipped, pretty much all you need.  A wired free connection in the room for the laptop was really nice.  Driving distance to shopping\\u002Fgrocery.  The tuck shop (snacks and drinks) had a really nice selection that wasn't wildly overpriced like minibars can be.\\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't stay there again unless I got a fantastic deal like I did this time.  The space wasn't worth it as I prefer more sophisticated hotels.  I wasn't left with a bad impression, not at all, but the hotel itself wasn't memorable at all",
            "The suite was spacious and the bed was extra comfortable.  We could watch the planes landing from our windows but we did not hear the planes at all.  The full kitchen was complete and included utensils, dishes, pots & pans.  The only thing missing was an oven.\\n\\nPopcorn was also provided.  Supper is complimentary from Monday thru Thurday and it consisted of soup + pizza on the Thurday we were there.  They also have fresh baked cookies in the lobby.\\n\\nat $101 cdn per night this was excellent value for the area.  many restaurants one block away and half an hour drive from downtown Toronto, it was perfect for us.\\",
            "From the minute we arrived and my daughter was offered as many cookies as her small tummy could manage by the check-in clerk, the staff could not have been more helpful nor polite. We were arriving after a long flight from the UK, and were slightly pensive about how good\\u002Fbad the Residence Inn was going to turn out, given we only booked as our normal hotel we use in the Pearson airport area was full. Anyhow, the rooms are very new, clean and fitted out to a very high standard. The pool and fitness areas were also very neat and tidy, and there\\u2019s even an outdoor basketball court for those that still have some energy left after a long journey. High speed internet access and breakfast are also offered complimentary by the hotel, and on both counts the service provided was first class. We\\u2019ll definitely use the hotel again on future trips.\\",
            "Stayed here briefly before flying back West. This has great rooms, is just off the main hotel strip by Pearson Airport (YYZ) and the breakfast was not too shabby either. Very much recommended and I downloaded the Marriott app for my iPhone which made checking in and out a breeze",
            "I just got back from Toronto for business and my company booked us at this hotel for \\n4 days. Great hotel! Everyday there was a free breakfast. The rooms had full size appliances in the kitchenette, had a living room with TV, separate bedroom with TV, a separate area off the bedroom with a large sink area, and a separate bathroom with toilet and shower. It looked to be just remodeled. It was one of the nicest rooms I have stayed at and also comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are travelling to Toronto. Pool, hot tub and exercise room also. The staff were very friendly and helpful",
            "Used to stay at Stage West hotel but after having stayed once at the Marriott Residence Inn for business, it has become my preferred hotel in Mississauga. Here are some of the reasons:\\nVALUE:\\n\\u2022\\tFirst and foremost, great value for what you get. Last time I stayed there was with my wife and two sons and one girlfriend (my son\\u2019s, not me!) We stayed in one of the two bedroom suites, breakfast and a light super and free parking were included for a cost of $199.00 plus taxes! Below are listed some other benefits of staying there.\\nROOM:\\n\\u2022\\tHave stayed in both one and two bedroom, both very comfortable, fully equipped kitchen, separate bedrooms with TV\\n\\u2022\\tThe two bedroom has a fireplace and en-suite bathroom in each room. Great for two couples or family.  \\nAMENITIES:\\n\\u2022\\tBreakfast and light dinner provided, \\n\\u2022\\tSmall gym, pool and whirlpool. \\n\\u2022\\tSmall tuck shop with basics\\nLOCATION: \\n\\u2022\\t10 -15 minutes from Pearson Airport,  hotel has free shuttle\\n\\u2022\\tEasy access to highways, 401, 427, etc\\u2026..\\n\\u2022\\tWithin walking distance are numerous restaurants for all budgets, across the street there is a Boston Pizza, Jack Astor\\u2019s, Canyon Creek, Tuckers, if you walk a block or two there are several other chain restaurants\\nSERVICE:\\n\\u2022\\tCannot say enough about the exceptional service provided; especially by one of the front desk staff.  My son was flying in and was to meet us the Hotel. He failed to show up at the time we expected him, one of the front desk staff saw that we were still in the dining room long after everyone had left and came and ask if she could help. To make a long story short, she went out of her way to confirm my son had arrived in Toronto and then made arrangements to retrieve his lost luggage and get him to the hotel.  Wow!\\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\u2022\\tThis is not a full service hotel, there is no bar (there were beverages in the dining room that could be bought from the front desk). There is no restaurant other than breakfast room, but if you are looking for a very affordable, very comfortable accommodations particularly for a longer stay or with a larger group, you can\\u2019t go wrong staying there",
            "If you're going to Toronto and plan to visit places like Canada's Wonderland, the Toronto Zoo, Ontario Science Centre, and even downtown Toronto, I STRONGLY recommend the Residence Inn by Pearson Airport. In summary, the positives were great customer service, nice amenities, the room was luxurious, and the free hot breakfast buffet was as good or better than anything you would find at a restaurant! The only complaints I have are that there is no wireless internet (although there is a wired connection in room or lobby computers) and it would have been nice if the bathroom weren't only accessible through the bedroom (but that is a fairly minor gripe and didn't impact our stay at all). You will not find better service, quality, or value in Toronto!\\n\\nWe, two adults and a 9 yr old, stayed for three nights in July 2011, and will absolutely stay here again if we return to vacation in Toronto again. Our rate was $92 a night plus $8 for parking each night. However, when you factor in the free breakfast for three, the nightly cost goes from $100 to $75. The only other place you will find a price like that are the cheap motels where you don't get anywhere close to the quality offered at Residence Inn.\\n\\nThe location is great as you are just off of the 401 which you will use to get to most major attractions. It's tucked away and not on a busy street. It's by the airport so you will see airplanes, but I couldn't hear them and our room was at the end of the building facing the airport. The area is littered with restaurants! Moxies, Lonestar, Tony Romas, Montannas, Boston Pizza, and the Keg, just to name a few! There is a lacking in fast food and other retail, but having a great deal of choice when it came to dinner was a welcomed feature. \\n\\nThe hotel is well maintained and very clean. The basketball court was a nice plus; the swimming pool was medium sized but never felt crowded (and we went swimming at least once a day); the spa was nice because our kid could actually go in it (both the pool and spa were salt water, too); the parking lot was never crowded; there's an outdoor patio with BBQ for the guests to use; and I never found the halls to be noisy. There was always the latest newspapers available in the lobby, the staff posted a detailed weather forecast in the lobby, and two computers with a printer so that you could stay connected to the internet. The staff were beyond excellent - we showed up before noon and asked if there was any possibility to check-in early and were accommodated without any hesitation and the front desk even called us five minutes later to make sure the room was to our liking! The one time late in the day when we found no towels by the pool the staff quickly supplied some. In general it felt like the staff were genuinely fantastic at customer service. \\n\\nThe room was very spacious. My only complaint is that I wish the bathroom wasn't only accessible through the bedroom but that's minor. Internet is only available through a wired connection but there's computers in the lobby. The temperature in the room was so good that even with the air turned off and the outside temperature surpassing 30 degrees Celsius each day, we were still comfortable. The kitchen comes completely stocked with everything you need to cook and eat - including salt and pepper shakers! There was even a welcome basket with microwavable popcorn! The appliances worked and were by no means outdated. The under-mounted stainless steel sink was VERY deep. The bathroom was nice although if you like deep bath tubs you won't find one here. The sofa bed was comfortable - perhaps more comfortable as a pull out bed than as a couch. The TVs were nice and the one in the bedroom was close to the end of the bed which made it easier to read. There was plenty of storage space (two dressers and a large closet) and lots of seating - including a very nice desk chair and the two dining chairs, as well as an arm chair in the living room. The bedding was also comfortable although I must have been allergic to the pillow or comforter filling. There were at least three different pillow types available. Another nice bonus was an ice-maker in the freezer. Overall, it was an amazing room!\\n\\nThe final thing I wanted to mention was the breakfast... the free hot breakfast buffet easily covered the cost of parking and was as good as anything you will find at a restaurant! The selection was superb and changed slightly each day. While we were there the selection included waffles, french toast, sausage patties, sausage links, scrambled eggs, potato pancakes, beans in tomato sauce, four types of cereal, a variety of yogurt, muffins, donuts, bagels, english muffins, toast, cinnamon buns, fruit salad, fruit, oatmeal, and much more! There's also a good selection of beverages - orange juice, apple juice, cranberry juice, and grapefruit juice, tea, coffee, and milk. There was also every appropriate condiment you would expect - such as, but not all inclusive, powdered sugar, granola, chocolate chips, syrup, cream cheese, six types of jam\\u002Fspread, even cheeze wiz. Needless to say, the breakfast was not just filling, but allowed you to pick up some snack options for later as you had the option of using disposable containers and cutlery. To add to the great spread, it was well maintained and someone was always there to refill the available food or pick up any plates you were done with. It was never too busy that we couldn't find a seat, but then again if it were that busy you could always take it back to your room and eat at your own table. If you show up a little late the selection may not be as good as around 7 am, but the one day we did show up late we still ate like kings! \\n\\nI was beyond impressed by this hotel and it's nice to know that there's still good value to be found in Toronto",
            "This hotel is super nice. The building and the facilities are brand new. The room we stayed had a micro wave oven, dishwasher and utensils and complete dinner set for four. We never use them but they are there just in case you are the type who choose to cook your own food. The hotel will even do the goceries for you if you needed them. The staff are superb. I will not hesitate to recommend this hotel.\\",
            "We recently stayed at the Residence Inn for a girls hockey tournament.  Normally three nights in a basic hotel room with 2 Adults, 2 Kids, 2 Sets of Hockey Equipment etc.  is crammed and not very pleasant.  The rooms at the Residence were like mini apartments!  There was a full kitchen, a living room with pull out sofa bed, and a separate bedroom (with a door that shuts which is great for privacy) and the bathroom off of the bedroom.  On Thursday evening they had a free supper which on that night was soup and salads, but the menu shows chili, shepherds pie etc.  It was really good.  The continental breakfast is a hot breakfast which is also very good.  Housekeeping came in every morning and filled the dishwasher, ran it and then emptied it the next day --- awesome!   Upon getting home from our trip I realized I had left my reading glasses on the desk.  I called housekeeping and they did find them and Fedex'd them to me within two days --- Thank Goodness!  Overall a great stay and definately will look for Residence Inn whereever we travel in the future",
            "Due to our plane being quite delayed, we missed our connecting flight and this is where we were housed until the next day when we could fly out.  There was a free shuttle but the driver was exceptionally rude when a girl in about her late teens\\u002Fearly twenties was struggling to get her bag up the stairs and he chose to answer his cell phone while watching her.  The drive from the airport was quite quick and check in was welcoming and friendly around 10:45 pm.  We booked a return to the airport on the 6:40 am shuttle.  We were given a $20 dinner voucher by the airline but there is no restaurant open.  Instead, we could choose from their \\\"Market\\\" which consisted of frozen, microwavable dinners, Kraft Dinner (microwavable), instant noodles, chips, pop, ice-cream.  After a long day of travel, this is not \\\"dinner\\\".  The hotel and hallways look very worn and tired with carpet ripped and stains.  When we opened the door to the room, the smell that wafted out was remnants of many different guest's cooked meals that have lingered for a long time.  It was definitely enough to make me gag, literally.  The place is very dated and the shower leaked.  The bed was comfortable and the hotel quiet throughout the night.  The next morning, we skipped the breakfast and attempted to catch the shuttle.  We found that they shuttle had left early and we missed it.  We were scolded by the front desk that the shuttle has a tight schedule to keep but we showed her the time and it was definitely before 6:40 am.  She called them and they returned to pick us up.  Never would I ever stay here or any where near this hotel chain again",
            "Arrived late after 10 pm. Very close to airport, didn't take long by taxi. We booked a two bedroom apartment. It had two washrooms, which was helpful. D\\u00E9cor was a bit dated but the  overall environment was homely. Quite good free breakfast",
            "I did some research on this hotel on this site, and heard it was new- 2 years old. \\nThe rooms - marble tile bathrooms, new pillow top beds, new carpeting, nice view.\\nBreakfast - complimentary - scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, all continental items, waffles, pancakes - all complimentary\\nService - everyone from the front desk, to the breakfast help to housekeeping is friendly and do a terrific job. \\nAl in all, I can't think of a better hotel experience. They also have a nice fitness center, and pool.\\nYou are right by the airport (2 miles), can see planes landing, but amazingly , cannot hear them at all inside the hotel.\\",
            "Just 5 minutes from Toronto Airport (complimentary airport transfer if required),  this hotel did not disappoint.  We were 4 adults and had booked a 2 bedroomed suite. It was spacious, immaculately clean with new furnishings and state of the art tv's in both bedrooms and sitting room.  The sitting room has a log effect remote control fire for cosy winter evenings and a  well equiped  kitchen which looked as though it had never been used.  With 2 ensuite bedrooms this apartment on the 9th floor (top floor) could easily sleep 6.  The breakfast was buffet style with plenty of choice and  complimentary coffee and  tea (make it yourself)  was available allday from the sitting area. The two men in our party made the most of the free internet service and I enjoyed the indoor swimming pool. All-in-all, this has to be one of the best airport stopovers we have ever had. \\nJune 17th 2006.  Jan & Brendan Lomax & Ann & Gordon Milne,  London .UK.\\",
            "Great staff. Great breakfast. Pet-friendly. Well equipped kitchen. Internet and power at the kitchen table.  Comfy couch and huge walk-in shower. Price on small snack items at convenience store levels.  I could move in and live happily. Special thanks to Frey and Elny for their warm and careful attention to my extreme Celiac sensitivities",
            "Had a junior suite with 2 bedrooms and kitchenette. Very well stocked (fridge, ice, toaster, coffee maker etc.), clean and had everything we needed. Pool and hot tub were fine as was the unexpected social hour snack\\u002Fmeal. The complimentary breakfast was very well done, lots of hot and cold choices. But beyond all of that, the staff are the winners of this hotel. Well done and thank you",
            "We reserved a 2-bedroom apartment for a long weekend for four adults and one child.  It was perfect with two bedrooms, each with a bathroom and a sleeper sofa in the separate living room.  The full kitchen with a table was well used and we prepared some meals.  The full-breakfast was one of the best complimentary we've had at a hotel.  The staff was always helpful and courteous.\\n\\nThe indoor pool and hot tub, were large and well maintained and the workout room while small was pretty good.\\n\\nThe hotel is near the airport so you have to drive a bit to the city but the airport shuttle was handy when arriving and leaving.  Overall, a great value for a clean and well maintained hotel",
            "My family and I booked a 2 bedroom suite at this airport hotel and I was a little leery due to some of the negative reviews, but when we walked into our suite everyone went ...hmm nice... The fully equiped kitchen had granite countertops and ceramic tile floors as did the 2 bathroms in our suite. The beds were very comfortable and with 3 tvs in the suite we all watched what we wanted in complete comfort. At $230 per night for this luxury suite along with a hot breakfast made this a great value. The service was very sincere and friendly and we really could not have asked for more",
            "I have been to a couple inns near the airport for some reason or another and this has been by far the best service I have received.  The staff was very friendly and helpful no matter the time. There is a full breakfast served included at the hotel and they change the types of food offered every day I was there.  There is no restaurant or bar in the hotel but there are plenty within walking distance and they even have a full grocery delivery service to the hotel so you can use the fridge, microwave, stove and dishwasher in your room if you'd prefer.\\n\\nThe planes from the airport can still be heard but they're much quieter here as it's not on the main path like other hotels nearby.  We were on the third floor and after 21:00 there were no problems with noise level.  During the day you could hear the planes go by but it wasn't very loud to begin with.  We were on the South side of the hotel which faces the air traffic more than the North side and we had no problems.\\n\\nThe hotel room itself was very clean and spacious.  This hotel does allow pets but there is a charge to sanitize the room afterwards and each of the rooms with an animal are clearly marked.\\n\\nOverall I would say this is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Toronto and it will be the one I book again any time I need a hotel near the airport.  Thank you for the great experience",
            "If you are traveling to Toronto and have to stay at the airport then this is the place for you. The service is great, the staff are friendly and welcoming and the rooms are clean. Let's face it, no one wants to go to TO and stay overnight at the airport. So why to go somewhere that you feel welcome and at home",
            "Booked a last minute family trip for the weekend. Great hotel, wonderful full All-American breakfast included. Clean, modern, courteous staff. Wished they had free parking. Otherwise absolutely nothing to complain about. Kids were confortable in the two room suite which has full refridgerator, range, dishwasher, micowave and coffee pot. Noticed the night before check out that they also offer free grocery shopping. Grocery is billed to your room. Wish I noticed before, traveling with 3 young kids we would have certainly taken advantage of this. Also coin operated washing machines. The kids also enjoyed that the pool stayed open until 11pm. Perfect for relaxation at the end of our daily adventures",
            "In any given year I usually have several occasions to stay out by the Toronto Airport even though I live in the region....usually while attending conferences at the nearby Congress Center. In the past, my hotel of choice has always been the The Courtyard Marriott, and although it's not my favourite Courtyard, I am a strong supporter of the Marriott brand and that hotel has served my needs - however.......on this occasion the Courtyard was sold out and I ended up booking the Residence Inn - what a lucky break!!\\nThis hotel was a stand out from the moment I walked through the doors - the lobby exuded warmth & charm, the front desk staff were welcoming and cordial and the check-in process was easy. I had a one bedroom suite which included a sitting area, separate bedroom, comfortable work area, fully equipped kitchen with eating area, two flat screen TV'S , separate dressing area and nice bathroom. The room was spotlessly clean,  the bed super comfortable and the shower  divine with excellent water pressure. There is a small gathering room, complete with fireplace & T.V. in the lobby where they serve an included full breakfast every morning and evening snacks from Monday to Wednesday. There is also a small market stand where you can buy chips, snacks and frozen entrees for your room. The hotel will also do a grocery run, upon request, and charge to your room. If cooking in your room is not your style then there are a myriad of excellent restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. There is a nice sized indoor pool, basic workout room and outdoor basketball court. The only update that I think this hotel would benefit from would be the introduction of a small bar in the evenings - the one advantage that, in my mind, the Courtyard has over the Residence Inn. My recent stay was only for  three nights but I would have been perfectly happy to have stayed three weeks - I was that comfortable! This is my new \\\"go to\\\" hotel - paradise at Pearson",
            "We always try to stay at Residence Inn when we are away from home for various reasons, which includes homely feeling, good breakfast in the morning and if needed ability to cook food. Toronto Airport Residence Inn is no different, its very nice place, very clean rooms, fully equipped gym, laundry facilities on 3 floors, good breakfast in the morning. Honestly I didnt find anything lagging anywhere. Only issue is, the place is bit far from downtown, but if you can put up with that, its fine. Since we had a car, we were ok. There is also free shuttle to the airport. There are restaurants in walking distance from the hotel so you dont need to drive. In all very pleasant stay, I also like seeing airplanes landing which was very nice. If you have issues with the very little noise of aircraft, then try to get a room on the other side of the building, but the noise for me is completely alright, its much subtle than other hotels I have stayed at. We will comeback, just dont know when. Keep up the good work",

            "Rooms are nice with full kitchen.  I had a one bedroom suite.  \\n\\nExercise room a was standard  and a indoor pool\\n\\nOutside seat great as we'll. \\n\\nHotel does have shuttle that runs on demand.  \\n\\nTried the airport shuttle.\\nIt was free and service was excellent.  \\n\\",

Airport closes at 1am\\nSmall dining table and sofa and chair.\\nShower and toilet are separated from sink area so no waiting for the travel partner.\\nHealthy breakfast choices available including; fruit, oatmeal and cereals. Waffle maker.\\nI have stayed here several times.  Good restaurants within minutes by foot.  Restaurants also deliver.\\nHalf court basketball on the property.  Ask front desk for a ball",
            "We had a 2 Room suite that was quite large. Had a king size bed, stove, desk ,dishwasher, pots, dishes and all the utensils you would need if you where here for a long term stay. Also had a full size fridge and 2 flat screen TVs. Breakfast and airport shuttle where included in the rate. You can call for the shuttle on arrival and for the return to the airport just make a reservation at the front desk. They have an arrangement for you to park your car when you go away on holidays. We arrived by plane so we did not use this service. the only  thing I did not like was the hotel does not have a restaurant or a bar. We had to walk to the hotel next door to have lunch. There are restaurants nearby but when we arrived Sunday night most had closed early. It was very quiet inside the hotel even with flight going overhead we heard nothing. Good soundproofing",
            "We got a suite for a very reasonable rate. The staff is fantastic, from the drivers, housekeeping and breakfast team to the front desk. \\nThe hotel offers a delicious free breakfast, including oat meal with a variety of toppings, yogurt, French toast, scrambled eggs, etc. \\nThere is also a 24-hour courtesy shuttle service to the airport; call the hotel to request it. \\nThe place has a pool, coin laundry, and in the evenings they offer free events with finger food. \\nWhat else can you ask for? :-)",
            "Close to airport with a convienent free shuttle service.  There is a managers reception with ok food and a charge for beer wine.  A few close restaurants near by within walking distance of 1\\u002F2 mile.\\n\\nHotel staff was very friendly and attentative"

            "I recently stayed at the Town Inn Suites and was pleasantly surprised. It is centrally located to downtown and the subway. It is very walkable. There are rental bikes nearby if you was to bike around the city. The suites are large with a separate bedroom and kitchen. The rooms are clean. The continental breakfast is basic. I will stay here again if my travels bring me back to Toronto",
            "We stay at the town suites inn. This place is an older apartment building that has been upgraded. Rooms were clean.. the room was very hot even with the heat turned off. You cant go out on the balcony they are locked. They dont have anywhere in the bathroom to hang your shower towels..staff are polite",
            "Nice hotel. Good location. Comfortable bed. And clean and tidy. Staff polite and helpful (the tour firm they recommended for Niagara falls were great and reasonably priced. I even did the boat ride, which was spectacular. ) Some negatives: they clean the room every other day (maybe that is the norm); there were a few broken things in my room (one of the lights and the towel rail); the gym is private and needs to booked and paid for). The breakfast is minimalistic,  but suited me as I don't each much first thing in the morning.  I was on the 27th floor or what they call the PH floor. Overall,  I would consider it again",
            "In need of major renovations, everything was old, damaged and showing significant wear and tear.  While I would say it was clean, the lack of overall quality was apparent and the lack of caring from the owners to maintain their property.  It came with decent ratings on Expedia but I\\u2019m really not sure ho",
            "Had to review! Stayed twice in 1 week, seeing 2 rooms, 1 with kitchen and 1 without. Both were perfectly clean, spacious, well decorated and comfortable.  The staff was very helpful; you got the impression, they all wanted to make sure your stay was the best it could be. Parking ($30 per night) was a little pricey, but easy to use and very convenient, appreciated. The atmosphere on colourful Church street and the convention shops surrounding the hotel greatly added to our seamless, stress free stay. You\\u2019ll definitely feel safe.  Across the street and south 100m is a great coffee shop in the morning and a pub in the evening, providing a perfect start and end to your day.  Do not hesitate to stay at this hotel, period",
            "I booked this hotel because others in the Yorkville Areo were extremely expensive. While the outside of this hotel doesn\\u2019t look exciting, I was very pleasantly surprised at the inside of the room. It looks like a chic simple New York City modern apartment.\\n\\nOnly con is the breakfast situation - at peak time (730ish - 830), forget about getting in there peacefully.  Better to go out on the streets for a pastry.   \\n\\nLocation is amazing.  Staff friendly",
            "Mediocre at best. I was impressed with the lobby, very clean and modern. I booked the \\\"Luxury King Suite\\\"  which was quoted to have \\\"granite countertops\\\" along with a photo of a lovely suite with an island and dining table. When I unlocked my room, this was not at all what I was given. We had a kitchen with stainless appliances that looked very new - but plain countertops and no island or kitchen table. We had a couch & chair with a marble coffee table along with a TV. They have very clearly tried hard to update the rooms with modern furnishings but have forgotten to update the actual space. The flooring was old & paint stained. The 90s mirrored closet doors don't close properly. The bathroom was very old and the square tiled flooring was stained and nothing was updated but the lighted mirror. The room was clean and all the kitchen appliances etc were present. The bed was very comfy as well. Unfortunately, this room just wasn't what I was expecting to walk into, given the description and photos on the emails\\u002Fwebsite. Overall it was fine for the price I paid for Toronto, I was just disappointed to walk into a very institutional-like room. No paint, art, or wallpaper. Just stark white with no decor. I should add the check-in staff were wonderful! I did not complain or bring my concerns to the front desk because that's just not who I am. I just don't want anyone else to be let down by what is promised vs what they receive",
            "Fantastic place as your close to where you want to be.  After travel in 3 time zones from Hawaii, Houston and Toronto in one week this apartment hotel is a great place.

            "My wife and I spent 5 nights here. The location was close to the gay village neighbourhood and high-end Yorkville Ave. We were able to walk to most things we wanted to explore. \\n\\nThe hotel room was a cute, cozy, and clean apartment. We had a full kitchen, living space, bedroom, and bathroom with a rainfall shower. It was everything we needed to have a relaxing space to enjoy after a long day of exploring. \\n\\nWe only used housekeeping once since we were only there a few days. If we requested clean towels or toilet paper from the front desk it was brought up in less than 5 minutes. \\n\\nA classic continental breakfast of muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit was provided each morning. \\n\\nWe stayed in a \\u201Cluxury king suite, one bedroom\\u201D booked through Hotels. ca and the room was wonderful. I\\u2019d stay here again",
            "We recently stayed at the Town Inn Suites.  Room were newly renovated, clean, tastefully decorated, spacious, comfortable, and well equipped.  Nothing was lacking.  Staff was cheery, friendly, and super helpful.  It was a truly wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend this place.  Also great was its perfect location to restaurants and shops",
            "Location is fantastic, 5 minutes from bloor  and yonge and subway. The appartements are fully renovated with full kitchen. The staff is uber friendly and helpfull. The hotel is very clean and well maintained. Too bad that they are getting rid of the pool to build a gym. Good value",
            "Look great in photos. We had a luxury king suite with an air-conditioner that didn't work, a fridge that didn't work and a constant beeping sound that could not be identified. I thought there was a washing machine and dryer in the suite, there was not. When inquiring about this we were moved to a queen suite but still paid the same price as a luxury king suite. The air conditioner worked but the washing machine did not. The bed was horrible! We stayed 1 of our 2 nights and went to another hotel for the second night. I notified the booking company that we wanted to cancel but because we didn't notify the hotel itself (we were told it was all taken care of) we were denied our refund. It was my understanding that because we booked through a third party they cancel the room. Very disappointed",
            "I've been to various downtown hotels over the years and the rooms are often very small. I really enjoyed this condo-like \\\"suite\\\". Mine had a small kitchen as well as a living room area. Note that the hotel has different types of rooms.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the stay. I also found the bed to be very comfortable. The living room was nicely arranged. Really had an excellent time and would have happily stayed longer",
            "I was pleasantly surprised how efficient and friendly the staff is. The room was very clean and comfortable. My favourite part of the entire experience- the room and the sheets smelled fresh unlike that usual stale, hotel smell. The bathroom sink was perfectly functional. Some of you may be chuckling at this, but I seem to experience the clogged\\u002Fslow sink very often at my hotel stays(some of them 4 and 5 stars). It seems that by the time I do my nightly washing the sink gets full that the next person can't even use it. \\nThe checkout went smooth and I was even asked if a ride needed to be arranged for me! Very, very professional and pleasant staff!!",
            "I arrived early and in the rain. I was able to store luggage, check in early and helped find the museum by the very friendly front desk staff.\\nMy room with a king sized bed was clean and comfortable. I loved having my own kitchenette.\\nThe view was lovely and I will definitely stay again",
            "We come with a group of 20+ people. The prices are really fair for the rooms we got. Spacious living room with a lot of facilities such as dish washer. Though it's a pity the balcony could not be accessed. Pool and gyms are closed due to the Covid. The staff were super helpful with the recommendations and even helped us to find agencies to book some trips. The service was fast when we needed something. Great location as well,  the street behind the hotel has a lot of restaurants and bars. Close to Eaton Centre",
            "The room are fully equipped with Kitchen amenities, they are spacious and comfortable. This hotel is centrally located and easy access to subway and food outlets. Also it is safe location for families who intend to visit Toronto.  Their front office Manager Mr. Vishal was very helpful as he was always available to address our concerns",
            "At first we thought this place was a bit out of the way and we should have stayed at the waterfront.  Well actually Church Street was the right choice, located on Church between Wellesley and Bloor\\u002F Yonge on the subway it was actually a really good location.\\n\\nWent for the bigger apartment (which we probably didn\\u2019t need) and appreciated the space.  Though a little tired the place was clean and well run.  Really comfy bed.  Perhaps a better range of TV channels for non Canadian visitors.  I wouldn\\u2019t have minded if they were in English or French, just a bit more choice.\\n\\nBreakfast is why I have marked the star rating down.  Breakfast is served in a small room that would seat probably a dozen people.  The food doesn\\u2019t vary and if staying for more than two days you are likely to tire of it.  Let\\u2019s just say it\\u2019s an interpretation of a continental breakfast.  But that\\u2019s not why you are in Toronto. Right?  There are plenty of places nearby to get breakfast, but that\\u2019s a pain to feel that you need to, having the cost already in your price.  It\\u2019s probably a better idea to grab breakfast, head to the lift and have it in your room, especially at busy times",
            "Nice clean well equit rooms.  In ideal location for exploring Toronto near to a subway station. Staff friendly and helpful.\\nThe only issue was with breakfast as the room was tiny so had to take food back to the apartment to eat. Also only opened till 9am for breakfast felt this should have been longe",

Our room was beautiful, King size bed with Fully equipped Kitchen , living room. Our room was very clean ,everything we needed was there, such an amazing place , parking is on premises , and breakfast offered is across the street. The pool was not opened at this time, understanding, but look forward to our next visit. amazin",
            "Stayed here for 5 days. The staff are extremely  helpful and efficient and have a professional  style. We were upgraded to a lovely apartment before we left Australia  perhaps  because  we mentioned  that we were on our honeymoon!! Jun couldn't  do enough for us with emails back and forth, prior to us beginning  our trip across  Canada. The Deluxe King Suite was lovely..even has a kettle!!! Kitchen is very modern with good appliances  and full size oven and stove top. Large microwave oven, and very large stainless steel  fridge. The only minus was the free breakfast.  Very basis choices indeed..\\nThere is a decent grocery store at the corner of the next block, which is a few minutes  walk ( a convenience  store is directly across from the hotel) (didn't go to that one). A hairdressing  salon is just around the corner and Croissant  Tree restaurant  is diagonally  opposite.  This eatery is great for any time of the day meals or snacks. Very cheap quality food in a nice setting.. There is a coin laundry in the hotel and an indoor pool. Dog friendly  too. Definitely  would recommend this  hotel",
            "I stayed in a suite here for 2 weeks while looking for somewhere permanent to rent. My suite was perfectly fine, not high end luxury but not budget either. It had quite a large kitchen and living space, a bathroom (with a shower but not a bath), and a separate bedroom. I wasn't here on holiday so it was nice to have some form of kitchen to cook with. The kitchen had most things you would need.\\n\\nThe bedroom was a little on the small side, partly because there was a huge king sized bed and not much room for anything else. The bathroom was nice, but I had some problems with the hot water in that I had to leave the shower running for 30 minutes sometimes before it got to a reasonable temperature to shower in. Since moving into a condo in Toronto I have the same problem, so I wonder if it's a common thing here.\\n\\nThe wifi was a little slow but functional. I had to sign in again every 24 hours which got irritating given I was there 2 weeks.\\n\\nI stayed here during the COVID-19 pandemic and I was self isolating here after arriving in Canada. The staff were mostly accommodating of this. The only issue I had was requests getting misinterpreted when calling down to reception for something, usually ending up in them bringing the wrong thing or too much of something which was wasteful. Because of the circumstances during my stay, the location made little difference. But if I were getting about, I think I might have found the location a little too far away from the centre",
            "We took a family suite at $400\\u002Fnight in Nov - parking an extra $30. The suite is well appointed, clean & comfortable. The hotel is very central in D\\u002FT Toronto everything is close. the staff is nice.\\nWhat it lacks is amenities - there is barely enough crockery & cutlery for 4 people, 2 cooking pans, 2 cooking utensils, no paper towels, no salt\\u002Fpepper, 2 tissue boxes, 2 sets of towels, 1 bar of soap for 5 people, coffee pods never replenished. I twice asked the reception for towels which never came. Toiletries were never replenished during our stay.\\nThe heater didnt work, which they came & fixed very quickly.\\nA good place but certainly not worth the price",
            "This was my first time at town inn and everything was amazing. I was missing a pot in the kitchen, and I called front desk and they were very quick with bringing one straight to my room. Over all amazing experience and everything was clean. I will for sure be booking again",
            "When we arrived we were surprised as the pictures on the website are very deceiving.\\nPeeling wallpaper, drywall, mould in the bathroom along with a few pubic hairs, the vent fan was filled with hanging lint and did not work and  hundreds of dead bugs in the light fixture above the dining table.\\nMaintenance had to come and replace our kitchen table, and open windows by pushing them out because the cranks were all broken.\\nWe had to go to the dollar store to buy utensil even after housekeeping brought more cutlery. The Keurig leaks so had to put it on a tea towel, which we had to ask for since there was no tea towels or dis soap to wash dishes.\\nWe called to have our garbage removed after the second day and we were told to bring it to a garbage chute ourselves.\\nWe will never be back. We\\u2019ve taken pictures of notes to the manager who just didn\\u2019t seem to care about our concerns",
            "We booked a \\u201Cluxury suite.\\u201D  While it was spacious and had large windows, there was nothing luxurious about it. The place screamed \\u201Cdeferred maintenance.\\u201D  Furniture was old, tired, and uncomfortable. Extensive water damage in the bathroom. What was described as granite countertops were plastic. Everything about this suite screams \\u201Ccheap\\u201D from the poor quality flooring to the tiny televisions. To make matters worse, the hotel has no gym, which I consider unacceptable in 2024. There is actually a gym in the building but the hotel has no arrangement for guests to use it. I am really regretting booking at this place",
            "I'm always so impressed with the suites. They are spacious and are well stocked. The king size bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were soft. There were two TVs in the suite and the WiFi worked extremely well. The whole place is very queen and the staff is always friendly.",
            "We booked this hotel at the last minute, which is not normal for us but we had some circumstances that made it necessary.  This is the most we've ever paid for a room. $290 per night Canadian,  There were plenty of great things about the hotel, especially the location that was convenient to Toronto's wonderful public transportation system and good walking as well.  There were supermarkets nearby.  The desk staff were friendly and I appreciated that they wore masks.  It was handy to have a kitchenette in the room and the bed was notably comfortable.  Trips of 5 nights or more came with a free airport pickup, which worked as planned.  The shower was good with plenty of hot water.  I liked that they had recycling in the room.\\n\\nWe often stay at low budget hotels, and this place was less clean than most.  Attached are some photos of just a sample of the stains and food that were smeared on the wall when we checked in.  There was a weird stinginess about the place.  For example, the room came with a dishwasher and we stayed 5 nights, but they only provided us with 2 dishwashing detergent tabs.  There was also a coffeemaker, but for two of us they provides a total of 4 coffee pods.  The room was serviced once during our 5 days, which was okay if they had let us know but it was strange they didn't tell us and we started to get overflowing trash.  There are some cooking implements but no hand dish soap, salt, etc.  We bought a bunch of breakfast food when we arrived because their website said breakfast was discontinued due to Covid, but when we left the first morning we saw that they were serving breakfast.  They have one instant coffee machine that folks were lining up for, with pastries, apples and yogurt.  The balcony looked inviting but was locked for unexplained reasons",
            "Really enjoyed my stay here. The suites are quite spacious and I really enjoyed having a full kitchen with COVID and all\\u2026 The staff were friendly and super helpful when I needed some recommendations. Looking forward to my next visit here",
            "We booked a suite here for a 4 day stay in Toronto. The suite was fairly spacious, but in our suite there was not so much as even a small refrigerator or a coffee maker. There was a balcony that was locked, so no way to access it.  The bathroom would have been good, but there was only one towel rack in the whole place. The rooms seemed cold and needed something to warm them up, such as throw pillows.   Breakfast was short and sparse. It ended at 9 AM. I got there at 8:50 to an empty coffee pot. I asked the attendant to bring more coffee. She smiled and said, That's It for coffee for the day. Unbelievable! What kind of hospitality it that? The breakfast room was tiny, not even close to big enough for a hotel this size. In short, I found this hotel to have lots of potential, but very little of it was realized. They need to up their game",
            "Recently stayed here with some friends.  Stayed in 2 bedroom suite. Upon arriving entered hotel lobby which was decorated beautifully recently renovated. Staff was very informative and detailed. On what hotel offered. Hotel offers complimentary breakfast from 7am again lounge is nicely decorated and updated. Has a pool and sauna for your personal use.   Hotel is in an amazing location close to all attractions and walking location to shops. Hotel staff was very helpful Assisting with our needs. Room was modern and nicely decorated. Only thing about this hotel is there is a $1000 deposit required for stay even though we  only spending one night. However due to the hotel amenities inside the room fridge stove microwave and newly update could understand why. When booking wanting great location and feeling the comforts of home away from home this is a great place to stay",
            "Great location in Toronto. We stayed in a two bedroom suite with kitchen. The kitchen diner was great with loads of space and air conditioning however the rest of the apartment was tired @nd needed updating. No access to the balcony and a tiny windowless bathroom. No air conditioning anywhere except in the kitchen diner. Continental breakfast was limited in variety. Lots of space and facilities for a group of five however I would not stay here again unless all areas were update",
            "It's not the nicest hotel in Toronto but it checks off all the boxes in terms of everything you'd need from a hotel. Rooms are big with a kitchen, although I didn't use it. There was also a free breakfast, which didn't have a ton of options, but helps with a quick start to the day. The staff are great and I'd probably come back",
            "Clean, comfortable and practical accommodation, just as shown in the photograph. Personable check-in staff. We enjoyed a quiet night's sleep. Suite was well-equipped with fridge, stove, toaster, dishes, dishwasher, etc. for eating in. Good space in our suite for sitting together with friends who stayed in an adjacent suite. I would not hesitate to choose Town Inn Suites in future",
            "I booked the Junior Suite with kitchenette, and a washer & dryer. These were extremely useful! It had a full-sized refrigerator and stove, and a dishwasher.  The suite was very, very clean and comfortable. I was on a high floor, with a great eastern view (note that there is construction on the west side.) Front desk staff are very professional and attentive. They recommended the purchase of a monthly parking pass to save me money. I also recommend using transit downtown. The Bloor\\u002FYonge subway interchange is less than a five minute walk away, and the subway is accessible (elevators and escalators - at least in the city core). The neighbourhood is people-friendly, and well served by caf\\u00E9s, restaurants, shopping, and small grocery markets nearby. Internet service was very good. I don\\u2019t have cable tv at home, and enjoyed watching that. NOTE: As with many suite hotels, housekeeping will visit only once per week; I didn\\u2019t need anything, but the front desk would have obtained extra towels, etc. I would have stayed longer if I could have, and the Town Inn will be my base the next time I am in Toronto. Book early so you get a high floor and a better view!  NOTE ALSO: if you park at the hotel, there are stairs from the parking garage to the elevators. I managed fine, but persons with more severe mobility issues will need to be dropped off at the front entrance or use the \\u201CGreen P Parking\\u201D on Charles Street.\\nThis hotel is an exceptional value for the city centre. Thank you, Town Inn!",
            "If I could give it zero stars, I would. Filthy, filthy, filthy. For $180 a night you don't expect to have to bring in your own Swiffer. The Swiffer pad was pitch black after we cleaned the floor. \\\"Disgusting\\\" does not begin to describe the place. Pots and pans had old food stuck inside, wine glasses stank of wine and had not been washed. Hair everywhere! Yuck. Stay elsewhere...anywhere else",
            "The Place is close to Downtown.  This neighborhood is known as \\u201Cgay Village\\u201D.  It\\u2019s not a problem for us, but some may don\\u2019t like.  People from the hotel were very nice.  In fact, our suite was a huge apartment complete, with 2 bed rooms, kitchen And 1 bathroom.   No breakfast.   Ideal for familys and thouse who travel in small groups",
            "I had stayed at this hotel years ago, and I was aware that hotel had gone through renovations but did not know what to expect..  When I booked room originally there wasn't two double beds room available online.  When I checked I asked if one was available, the manager quickly looked into it, and was able to give me a suite, at nominal increase in price.  When I walked in the room I was totally surprised how beautiful it was.  It was very modern, clean, and comfortable, the suite was very large.  It had stove, microwave, dishwasher, where I made good use of the appliances, during my 4 day stay.  The cleaning staff was a very sweet lady, and accommodated me with towels, toiletry, dish washer detergent, etc, I had told her it was ok not to make beds etc, I would take care of it. The location is great spot, close to many amenities, restaurants, shopping, few blocks away from Bloor St.  Wi Fi was free, and used it a lot for work and leisure. I was pleasantly surprised of this hotel and will plan to visit there again",
            "I was looking for a place that had a kitchen, and so this hotel provided a great full kitchen. But the suite was extremely bland, with laminate floors, plain walls, and Ikea-style furnishings. No personality at all. The room was large but I would have gladly given up half the space for an ounce of elegance and aesthetic appeal. The old-fashioned heating unit never got the room temperature above 19 degrees and so I had to get a space heater in order to bring the room to a comfortable temperature. Despite the website saying that the hotel had been renovated, the bathroom was the style of a Motel 6. The bathtub was strongly stained, giving it a very shabby appearance. There was no hook to hang bath towels. On the plus side, the parkade was very convenient, running $30\\u002Fnight. The staff was extremely friendly, with a very pleasant check-in. One drawback that is not due to the hotel itself is that it is directly across the street from a large construction site. Construction began at 6 am, hence not allowing for a full night\\u2019s sleep",
            "This is well located hotel with full kitchen and dining table rooms with street views still .\\nSubway station within 10 minutes walk and convenience stores around .\\nEveryday cleaning staff ensured towels and toiletries were replaced daily  and wifi worked pretty well .\\nAman at front office and the manager Vishal need to be complimented for ironing out  our first time stay .Will be back when next time travelling there .\\nOnly some rooms need to be refurbished   and hope would by the time we come back next",
            "My family and I, including 2 cats,  had to find an affordable place to stay while we were putting our condo on the market to sell. The location had to have a full kitchen and enough space for us all and more importantly would allow flexibility on the duration and of course accept pets.  Town Inn Suites was just the spot in the city. Super friendly, kind and professional staff, amazing location, clean and very diligent when it came to bring us items we needed",
            "We had a really excellent stay. The room was clean. The hotel manager and his staff are so friendly and efficient - they are like a family. Excellent location downtown. Everything you will need is in the apartment and the kitchen is fully equipped. The Wifi is fast and reliable. Would definitely recommend this place",
            "Always clean. Employees always ready to accomodate clients.\\nRooms clean. With the kitchenette, really practical. We recommand.\\nWe book sometimes last minute and they have rooms. With or without kitchenette",
            "One of the best hotels I've stayed at. The Aircondition worked, so many kitchen appliances, the room was spacious, the bed was big and locations was okay with nearby A&W and other restaurants. We didn't bother with the breakfast anymore hehe",
            "Great hotel for a family with plenty of space to keep everyone happy.  Fully equipped kitchen which we used mainly for the fridge, has dishes and cutlery, as well as a corkscrew.\\n\\nHousekeeping daily for new towels, emptied trash, and made beds.\\n\\nBreakfast is limited, but you can bring back to the room",
            "This suite hotel must have been nice when it was an apartment. It hasn't been kept up. the balcony doors are locked. I asked if mine could be opened, and was told that they have been locked for years, and could not be opened. The kitchen is fine to keep things in the fridge and heat things up in the microwave, but I wouldn't be excited to cook in it. It does come with an included  breakfast of coffee\\u002Ftea muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit"

            "I only stayed one night but service was great. Front desk was helpful and was able to check me in early without any issue. Room lay out is great also,  this will definitely be my go to hotel in Toronto. Enjoy",
            "Although the room was dated and unimpressive, it was some what comfortable. The location was very central down town Toronto and close to all transportation options, including walking distances to major entertainment attractions. The staff was very help and attentive and responded quickly to all of our needs. Especially Mr Demetrios who quickly arranged a executive cap to the airport first thing in the very early hours of the morning. Thank you Demetrios. Also our package included a very nice continental breakfast in the restaurant \\u002F lounge right on the main floor of the hotel. This would be a reasonable place for a short business stay in Toronto",

            "I can't say enough about how accommodating and helpful the staff are at this hotel.  They really care about your experience, and do whatever they can to make that happen.  The location is fantastic...right on TTC...walkable to many places.  There were a couple of cleaning misses in the suite, which was disappointing.  Everything else was great and I would stay here again...",
            "Construction was being done in a building across the street - buzz-sawing and hammering all night long.  In desperation, I called the front desk at midnight to ask about noise bylaws.  The first person was sympathetic and said \\\"If we can find a room on the other side of the building, would you be willing to move?\\\"  Keep in mind for later in the story...a hotel representative is offering me another room.  I said yes because I desperately wanted to get sleep before the work meetings I had flown in for.  He said okay, I'll transfer you to reservations.  The reservations guy was HORRIBLE.  He found a room, but told me it would be a $40 upgrade.  I said I'm checking out in the morning, so I get no advantage from an upgraded room.  He said \\\"You're getting an upgrade, so you have to pay for it\\\".  I said \\\"Why, nobody else is going to check in tonight to that room at midnight, you're not losing money by moving me\\\"  He said, \\\"I have 13 people who say they are arriving tonight\\\".  I said, \\\"Yes, but you've already booked rooms for them.\\\"  He said, \\\"well, one of them might want to upgrade\\\"!!!!   I couldn't believe it.  The illogic of it was bad enough...but I think what really got me is you could tell he just didn't care.  Didn't care about my discomfort, didn't care about the customer.  To add insult to injury, on the way out in the morning the front desk clerk said \\\"We're sorry about the noise issue you experienced\\\".   Well, one of you wasn't too sorry at all.\\nAll the other reviews about this hotel's windows not blocking any sound are correct",
            "I really appreciated the decor and the vibe. The restaurant was impressive. Great service! The location is idea for work and also for leisure. It is set just off Yonge which offers easy low stress arrivals and departure",
            "The front of house staff were very helpful and friendly. The room was exactly what we had anticipated and was perfect for a short business trip, although I'm sure it would be nice long-term as well. The suite had a great view and good internet, perfect for a short business trip. Would stay there again because of the location and size of the suite",
            "The hotel was very clean.  The staff was very helpful.  The continental breakfast buffet was very good.  We had dinner at the hotel which was delicious.  The hotel is within walking distance to Meridian Hall which was the reason for our stay as we were going to a concert there.  Would definitely stay there again",
            "The staff were so friendly and helpful the whole stay. The location is also great for attending events.  You can easily walk to the Scotiabank centre. I couldn\\u2019t hear anyone else from our room, which is perfect, as I have stayed at other hotels where you can hear parties and guests",
            "The hotel is quaint and in a great location. Very hidden but close to everything.  The rooms were nice and prices were good. A little tired in some areas, the bathroom needed some updates with paint etc. I would stay here again",

            "I booked this hotel for a work trip and based my choice on the online photos and reviews expecting a lot from this hotel. My friend and I walked in and immediately questioned everything we had been expecting from our stay. The staff barely acknowledged us when we walked in, it was dark with poor lighting and the signage was difficult for our uber driver to find. After we checked in and made our way to our rooms (my friend and I had separate rooms), we were immediately turned off as we walked into room 1. The room looks very much like low-income housing\\u002Fa dorm room (we had Studio rooms). The bedding in my friend's room had stains and the room did not look like it had been actually cleaned. Both rooms had dust and dirt built up on the corners of the rooms and behind the headboard (I didn't really want to take my shoes off). Throw pillows had stains. The bed sits awkwardly with the headboard against a sliding door and the room is all floor to ceiling windows\\u002Fsliding doors, making the bedroom extremely cold and no duvet was provided, only providing what I would describe as a couch throw blanket (the heat was turned off as well). All the bedroom furniture (both rooms) were in pretty rough shape and beaten up, it looked as if it had all been donated or bought second hand. After seeing the rooms, we spoke to the front desk and inquired about their cancellation policy, which luckily because we hadn't booked through a third-party website, we were able to check out the following day. The front desk staff simply shrugged and had no issues with us checking out after one day (instead of the 5 days we were supposed to be there), as if it was a common occurrence. After we left and had dinner, we returned to the hotel to call it a night and went to our rooms. My room had lights that flickered non-stop, and the shower door would not close. My blinds in my bedroom did not reach to the end of the window, and I was unable to even get dressed in my room without being on display for all the other facing windows to my room. My friend's room had a door which did not latch properly and constantly rattled, so it sounded like someone was attempting to enter the room all night. Also worth mentioning, you can hear anything and anyone in the hallways from your bed, which also did not help trying to sleep in this environment.\\n\\nAll in all, I think this hotel would have been decent if I knew what I was walking into. It would be no more than a 2.5\\u002F 3 star at BEST and should cost no more than 149 a night, and not the 329 before taxes. DO NOT trust the photos posted by the hotel. Other than its location, I would not recommend this hotel",
            "The photos of this hotel are beautiful, and the rooms are well decorated for what the hotel is, but it's not  quite as elegant as the photos would lead you to believe.\\nWe were on the 18th floor, which appeared to be under some renovations. The hallway was half painted, there was a plastic bag cover flapping off the vent in the hall.  It looks like an old apartment building that was renovated to be a hotel - popcorn ceilings would indicate circa 1970's.  The rooms were ok, there were several nail pops and marks in the plaster.  The \\\"balcony\\\" overlooked a garbage dumpster and the sides of some office buildings.\\nThere was a large TV in the studio, but the content was all stretched from a full screen input to widescreen, so it all looked pretty odd.\\nThe shower was nice, but the faucet was leaking consistently, had to keep the door closed to avoid being kept awake by the constant drip.\\nOverall it was fine, but given the option on another site for the Hyatt Regency for the same last minute price, it wasn't the best value",
            "Given it was New Year\\u2019s Eve we were expecting it to be very busy and loud but it was the complete opposite. There was a bit of noise from a room on our floor but it didn\\u2019t last long so it really wasn\\u2019t a big deal. Our stay was ok... the location is great although the hotel is tucked away on a tiny side street which isn\\u2019t necessarily a bad thing unless you want a view from your window. Views are basically nonexistent unless I assume you\\u2019re in a very high floor. If not you\\u2019re either looking at a wall or an ally with some garbage bins. I\\u2019ve stayed at the hotel quite a few times over the years and can\\u2019t ever remember having any sort of view. It\\u2019s not an issue for me since I live just outside the city but a tourist may not look at it the same way. Room service wasn\\u2019t cheap but surprisingly very good. The rooms are a good size with have a kitchenette which is nice but they do look a bit tired so they could use a bit of a refresh. Beds are small and not the most comfortable but not the worst either. Overall I think hotel is good for someone looking for a value hotel stay in Toronto but there are also a lot of other options to choose from",
            "Very uncomfortable stay. This hotel is rundown - don't be fooled by the pictures! The bed mattress was uneven, bedsheets were itchy and the pillows felt like sleeping on bricks - very uncomfortable. Walls are very thin too!\\nViews were looking into an office building and then an adjacent room and balcony (we were on level 20). Room service is only upon request before 6pm the day prior. Only plus is the location. Other than this, I don't recommend staying here, unless you want to punish yourself",
            "Thanks Barbie, you made our day \\uD83D\\uDE4F\\uD83C\\uDFFB\\nBusy morning, running late, had to leave the dishes from breakfast in the sink. Came back to the room after a long day out.

            "Here are some points I was disapointed about : \\n\\nDirty towels\\nRoom maintenance service was poor. They didn't fix my sheets and change my towels on 2 out of 6 days. \\nThe view was nothing near a city view.\\n\\nPrice was not matching service\\",
            "I had occasion to stay at the Cosmopolitan again, after a long period of not travelling, for a business trip in recent weeks. I was there for five days, and some of my team also stayed there off and on during that time.\\n\\nAs usual, the reservation process was seamless and the General Manager was very helpful in accommodating a special request upon booking.\\n\\nThe staff is also extremely accommodating. Take a moment to get to know them - they are all kind and interesting folks who will do everything they can to help you. They are extremely professional and will match the energy you bring.\\n\\nThe hotel is centrally located, very clean, well kept, very quiet (apart from the city noises no one can avoid) and having the amenities of a washer\\u002Fdryer, stovetop, dishwasher, etc makes the trip even easier. The balconies made all the difference in the world, and helped us all feel less 'cooped' in. \\n\\nDespite the fact that I had innumerable zoom-type meetings, the wifi never failed me. The convenience of having a drop off table for UberEats. etc. orders in the lobby makes deliveries easy and safe. The beds are comfortable, and the shower water pressure is incredible.\\n\\nThe staff at Wildfire (hotel restaurant) are very easygoing and accommodating and the food is great.\\n\\nI won't hesitate to stay there again - nor will I hesitate to recommend it to anyone",
            "We rented a room in the hotel for a long term stay of  month and was extremely  happy with aspects of the stay.  The room was large, bright and well appointment with modern furnishings.  The staff at the front desk were extremely helpful and always attentive.  The hotel is in a superb location, very safe and close to all that downtown has to offer",
            "It was beyond my expectations! The hotel was located in the heart of downtown Toronto. Next to the King Subway station and just a few steps from Union station. Harbour front, Hockey Hall of Fame, Dundas Sq. and so many other attractions are just steps away from the hotel. I stayed at the hotel for almost thirty nights, and my overall experience was great  The staffs were very welcoming, friendly and professional. The suite I stayed in, was very clean, on 22nd floor, with a not really breathtaking view. it also had a small kitchen, equipped with all necessary appliances, washer and dryer, TV and cable, and high speed internet, which all help you feel like you are at home",
            "I cannot believe some of these poor reviews. I have been here on an extended stay (6 months) while doing a renovation. \\n\\nI found the hotel to be clean, room is spacious especially for a downtown hotel with a restaurant that has both great food and service. The bed was comfortable, as was the couch to relax and watch television. The gym is not huge but it has everything you need including a Peleton.\\n\\nThe staff at the hotel are friendly and quite personable. They are quite busy but would go out of their way if I ever needed their assistance. You cannot beat this location, as you are just off Yonge St. with the subway right around the corner.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting or opting to do an extended stay as I did",
            "This hotel was perfectly adequate, and room had a kitchen, laundry etc; staff were helpful especially Rafi (sp?) with my bags. But the restaurant was closed for Sunday and Monday when I arrived (because nobody eats then)?  The rather indifferent guy at the front desk told me there were lots of restaurants 'over that way' but in fact the few accessible through construction debris were all closed. I walked for almost an hour on dark gloomy streets near Yonge Street  (as a lone woman) asking people and other hotels (which were much more helpful) where to find a restaurant, but finally could find only one Japanese place (yay but it was jammed full) and a sports bar open. And that was just by accident. My point here is that if you are going to close your restaurant for heaven's sake have the decency to do some research so you can accurately advise guests as to alternatives.  Won't stay here again in this sketchy area",
            "Great location, close to Union Station, pubs, restaurants, St. Lawrence market, coffee shops, grocery store.  In a safe area & on a quiet street. \\n\\nWe had the Executive View Suite, fantastic views from both bedroom and living space! Could see the city and CN tower.  Floor to ceiling windows. Loved the balcony! Full kitchen, washer\\u002Fdryer, safe for your valuables. Bed with bamboo sheets was very comfortable. Rahi and Leo were friendly and helpful.  Small but very stylish lobby.  Cool, nicely decorated pub \\u002F restaurant in the hotel.  \\n\\nViews and room amenities made this so much better than the average hotel room.  Really helped make our Toronto experience.  We will definitely be back and highly recommend the Cosmopolitan",
            "The location was within walking distance to many popular venues. The bar in the hotel was very upscale and modern with excellent service. Check in and out was a breeze. The room was like a little apartment. We will definitely be returning",
            "Getu and Liam front desk staff very friendly. Could not ask for kinder treatment from them. The housekeeping team kinda sucks sadly. As they're not doing daily room cleaning due to COVID, I asked for new towels. Someone brought be some new ones however, upon realizing they were wet I went back to the hall stopped and asked him why they were wet. \\\"There's nothing wrong with them he replied,\\\" and walked off. Do they not have dryers? You cannot gives guests half dried towels. I has a suite, yet it was not equipped with pots pans plates etc. When I called asking for a kettle, knife forks etc. they explained that they had removed those items in order to properly sanitize them. Fine to remove them but put them back. I had to call down so many times and continually ask for things. They also do not have kitchen paper towel. I used kleenex and bathroom towels as kitchen towels. I suspect my room was not properly cleaned\\u002Fwiped either- saw strands of hair from previous guest. By the way it can be quite noisy as its in the heart of downtown and they do really loud street cleaning at night- be mindful of this. Opt for higher floor to avoid loud street noise. Finally, I saw what seems to be a dried blood stain on blanket (see photo). Overall, I was not impressed by housekeeping",
            "Honestly this was a pretty bad night out arrived at 11pm on Valentine\\u2019s Day. After being in the room 15 minutes turned on tv and it didn\\u2019t work \\nI called the front desk and manager said nobody was available for maintenance at this time I said okay. Then afterwards no water in the mini fridge so I went down to main lobby to buy some and the manager said they have no bottled water to buy or give and to walk to 7 eleven at midnight which was ridiculous. Went to bed and woke up at 4 am freezing the room heating was not working. Didn\\u2019t sleep afterward told the manager at the front desk after and received a 30 dollar credit would never recommend or return",
            "We stayed for 3 nights and everything was splendid. The staff is very nice and helpful, the location is very central and convenient and the amenities are very comfortable. The rooms are like little houses, very well equipped with kitchen, cutlery, washers and drier and everything you may need. I definitely recommend and would stay again when in Toronto",
            "Hidden Gem!  Booked it last minute.\\nStayed for one night and exceeded beyond expectations. Reasonably priced. Close to Union Station, Financial District, Yonge Street.  The check in process & staff was seamless.  They were honest, friendly, and responsive. I would go back again. The room I got had a balcony,  which would be awesome for the summer. Room was spacious and clean. It came with the kitchen, washer dryer, walk in shower. \\nThank you for making my night stay comfortable",
            "Location cannot be beat. Period. The people working there are all so professional, courteous and friendly, from the front desk to the service people you bump into in the halls. The setup of the rooms are perfect, with everything you need, including a kitchenette to cut costs. Everything seems recently refreshed in terms of upkeep. Stylish without being fussy about it. I booked at the last minute, through HotelTonight. Got a great price. When I was there, they had a promo so I also got an amazing deal on their breakfast buffet, which features a wide range of options, hot and cold. The gym is small but has everything you need, in good repair  (including a Peleton, which I didn't use, but was surprised to see). There is free use of a jacuzzi pool in their spa (which you have to book ahead of time) but no pool. When I was there, they were about to begin their Winterlicious offerings of prix fixe lunch and dinner menus at a reduced price at their in-house restaurant, Viv. The food looked very good. They were very attentive and made sure you had everything you need, even suggesting things that might make your stay, or your foray into the city, better. The absolutely only downside of this stay was that some nearby building was doing some renovation and, unbelievably, was doing some of that renovation in the middle of the night. That has to be against the law. I was up quite high in the building. You can't hear it from the lower levels, apparently, but up high, there are a lot of equivalently tall buildings  creating sound canyons that reflect and amplify every noise. So every truck that is backing up, every I beam that is being dropped into place, every yell from a worker or fire engine siren reverberates through these spaces and makes it very hard to have an undisturbed night's sleep. But, in truth, that's not the hotel's fault. They really did a great job of creating a terrific oasis in a remarkably handy corner of a fantastic, and fantastically interesting, city",
            "When we arrived we were greeted by friendly staff who immediately guided us to some parking. The beds in the room were comfy, really enjoyed having a kitchen right in the room and the view from our balcony was breathtaking. I can\\u2019t remember the name of the gentleman who was working the evening of July 17th, however he was so helpful with directions and getting us set up with a different tv remote as our wasn\\u2019t able to set up the Xbox. Everyone working was so friendly and easy to talk to. The hotels safety features really make your stay feel more comfortable. I\\u2019d recommend this place to anyone who wants to stay in the heart of downtown as you can walk to dining, bars, attractions and just about everything else. We\\u2019ll be looking into staying here again",
            "Staff were very friendly and responsive. We loved the room (although wondered why a place with a kitchenette had not one pot or cooking implement). Bed was pretty good. Daily breakfast offerings were fantastic. Friday housekeeping was great. Weekend cleaning was an issue. Saturday\\u2019s was late (we came back at 3 having been out most of the day) and our room was just being done. Since we were back the cleaner worked quickly - did the bathroom, changed some towels, and made the bed. Floor wasn\\u2019t done, but we didn\\u2019t make an issue of it. Went out Sunday just before lunch; came back at 3, saw the cleaner on the floor and went to the lobby to wait for him to finish. Came back up 25 mins later and found our room not done, despite the \\u2018service please\\u2019 sign left on our door. Concierge did send someone up right away who changed the towels, cleaned bath and made the bed, although floor still not done (salt stains and grit from previous day still there). Coffee table & desk had finger prints so I cleaned them myself. Bedding not changed; we didn\\u2019t mind, although the card by the bed states that bedding was to be changed on third night of stay (it was our third night). \\n\\nThere are some great things about this hotel, although the weekend cleaning (schedule or staff, cannot say which) does need work",
            "A great location, walking distance to Union station, Distillery district, with great amenities including washing machine and dryer which were really useful. Helpful, friendly staff. Views not great from the 15th floor but we could catch a glimpse of the CN Towe",
            "The room\\u002F studio was spacious, comfortable & very clean. All amenities were present & in working order. Staff are amazingly helpful & friendly.  Restaurant food is great - only downside is lack of breakfast  Would happily recommend this hotel",
            "The Executive Cosmopolitan staff were lovely and very kind. The room was clean, and perfect for any type of getaway - whether you\\u2019re staying overnight, or for an extended period - they\\u2019re spacious, and have a kitchenette for those who are looking to avoid eating out for every meal. The hotel also has great amenities and it\\u2019s in a great location. Definitely recommended",
            "Spacious modern well equipped rooms\\u002Fstudios.  The staff were exceptionally gracious and warm, from the restaurant manager to the lovely housekeeping staff who greet you warmly in the hallways. The breakfast is quite delicious: not the standard overcooked scrambled eggs! A buffet of cheeses\\u002FBrie, warm croissants, meats ... very impressed",
            "The staff is helpful and friendly. The hotel is perfectly located and if a kitchenette is needed, it's the perfect pick. I usually stay at the Omni King Edward, but this time needed to stay and eat inside the hotel due to covid 19. I do recommend this hotel",
            "Booked this hotel very last minute for NYE. Rooms have an odd layout but Queen bed was comfortable really large tv with lots of channel. Appreciated the small kitchen but did not use except for refrigerator and microwave which worked fine. Balcony is a nice size but no view at all. The windows surrounding the entire bedroom were also something I could of done without as you don\\u2019t want all the people from all the surrounding building looking inside your entire room so kept the window shades down the entire stay. No place to really store luggage or clothing (only 3 really small size draws at the tiny desk). Best amenity was the use of the indoor jacuzzi at the spa on the 4th floor. Gym is super small but each time I visited I was the only person so it was okay but more than 4-5 people the gym would be uncomfortably small.\\nI\\u2019ve stayed at better locations in the city and wouldn\\u2019t put this on the top of my list next time I\\u2019m in town",
            "The front counter staff very nice, i was not able to use the flexipass, so was given a room upgrade. the balcony was small and just overlooked other buildings, but but gave great light and there is a privacy screen. The bathroom looks great and the bedroom small but comfortable for one person. There's a  keurig in the \\n room as well as a mini fridge freezer microwave large screen tv and a smaller one in the bedroom. My room is near the cleaners cupboard so a bit noisy... Louisa and Nasreem were very welcoming at the front desk. I was unable to use the QR code unfortunately it woukd not open the link.",
            "I got at least 5 texts and emails prior to arrival.  You're not my boyfriend.  Quit contacting me over the same stuff, especially AFTER I downloaded the app \\\"required\\\" for checking in and getting a digital key.\\n\\nI still had to check in at the front desk, but the nice man spent about 15 minutes trying to get the digital key to work, even though he'd already asked me how many (hard) keys I wanted.  \\n\\nAfter I'd been in the room for about an hour, I got another text saying that my digital key was ready.  \\n\\nI placed an order at the bar for a hamburger and fries.  All I asked for extra was mayo and ketchup and it took this guy about 10 mins to ring it up!  After he clicked and clicked and clicked, I finally asked him if he was typing a love letter or something.  \\n\\nIt was a bit annoying, too that I couldn't charge it to my room.  Well, maybe weird is a better word.  I guess the restaurant isn't really part of the hotel, even though it's open next to the lobby.\\n\\nThe room itself was very old-fashioned.  VERY much in need of an update.  This is downtown Toronto!  Not a roadside motor lodge from the 1970s.  \\n\\nI liked the separate kitchenette area, and very much appreciated the Keurig and the cold AC.  However, the AC blew on the shades and they rattled all night.  Again, not a big deal but it isn't what I expect for the amount I paid!  \\n\\nAlso, the shutter needed about 4\\\" more to keep light out.  \\n\\nI definitely won't be staying here again",
            "I was in Executive View Suite for 5 nights and it has everything as what you have in your apartment like kitchen, laundry and balcony. It made me feel like home as a independent person. The most bonus about the room is the view when I look out the window especially after wake up in the morning and night. The sun really brighten the whole room. \\n\\nOn my first day, I was expecting the pot, pans, tablewares, cutlery and utensils but it was all empty because of COVID. I salute them for taking it seriously to protect the staffs and guests. It did made me feel extra comfortable in my stay. I did request to bring those in my room because I wanted to cook and they brought it no problem. They don't bring everything because they weren't sure what I need but they would bring it if I requested specifically. \\n\\nThe staffs were very nice and professional. I felt very welcome. I'm hearing impaired and the front desk was willing to repeat it for me while she has mask on. As a hearing person while other person wearing mask don't mixed well together.\\n\\nI enjoy my stay overall and I will definitely come back",
            "After doing my research on the different hotels in the area I came across this one. As we wanted a quiet night in I read on their website that:\\n\\n\\\"Every room also comes with a modern 55\\u201D Flatscreen LED TV that allows you to cast your own media from any mobile device\\\". \\n\\nWhen I called the front desk I was told that this hotel doesn't have that feature and they would have to call their marketing team to get that description removed from their website. As of this review, it is still up. \\n\\nNot to mention, all the TV's are locked down with tamper proof hardware so no one is able to utilize the TV's in the room except for basic low res cable. \\n\\nI'm disappointed at the blatant false advertising and it's no wonder why people are more inclined to booking Airbnbs that don't try to limit their customers",
            "Excellent hotel. Good location, all attractions walkable. \\nStaff incredibly welcoming, helpful and efficient. \\nRooms well equipped with under counter fridge, job, microwave and kettle etc. \\nThere was some vehicle noise from the street, but that\\u2019s down to the location. All in all a good choice",
            "Front desk check-in was simple and efficient had my room within 10 minutes (checked in at 3pm).  Hotel was clean and trendy not large so very nice boutique vibe.  I had pre booked a Signature suite via hotels.com with a kitchenette and living area and room recieved was exactly as booked. Clean, spacious and comfortable.  Kitchen was stocked with glassware and dishware as well as some pay per use beverages in the fridge (cans of beer, smaller liquor bottles and wine). There is a washer\\u002Fdryer in the room nice for longer stays.  Large LG tv with good channels which is wall mounted but can be angled to the bed or living area or kitchenette. Closet had robes and slipper.  The one slight disadvantage was the balcony was not quite suitable for standing on as it was a sliding door with a railing right across it about 10\\\" in depth from door to railing.  But that was not a problem for me but may be for some.  All in all I would definately recommend and stay here again. Great location with many local amenities a walk away.",
            "+ Located in the city centre; you can walk around easily; it is near the train station to go to the airport or anywhere. \\n\\n+ It has a kitchen with all the essential utensils, soap, bags and a Nespresso machine with capsules. There is also a washing machine and a drier. There were two televisions, one in the bedroom and another one in the kitche-living room. The bathroom was fine. \\n+ We booked a cot for our baby, which was already in the room when we arrived. \\n+There is also a bar-restaurant on the floor. \\n+The people at the front desk were really friendly and helpful",
            "Nice hotel in the downtown. It is clean and modern. Has a functional kitchen with two fridges and a Keurig coffee machine. A few good places to eat nearby. Parking is expensive but that is expected in Toronto. Will stay again",
            "Comfortable. Great location.  Very friendly staff.  Felt real safe.    The bar in the lobby stays open later than on sign if there are any customers   A true apartment style.  Bed room kitchen even has a laundry!!!",
            "I was looking for a hotel that could accommodate my business needs (a place to work, kitchenette to prepare small food dishes and a condo feel) and also a place where I could bring a couple guests to entertain before a night out. This place felt like I was in my own downtown condo. Perfect.",
            "This hotel makes you feel like home. With a full kitchen and laundry in room, you can easily stay for a while. I stayed in the studio suite and it felt like a small one bedroom condo! Very comfortable. The rooms are very dry and you get a lot of static electricity, so be careful when you touch the door handles! No carpet made it feel fresh and clean. My only complaint was that the in-room Keurig did not work",
            "Anything you need or want in a hotel, they have it. Two TVs, a freaking balcony, a kitchenette with a microwave, fridge, stovetop, and silverware. Located downtown (walking distance to the harbour front and an LCBO). Highly recommend"

            "Got a chance to stay at Ivy in colourful Room 3 (each of the 4 rooms is different in size or decor) on a Saturday night.  Pure bliss!  Huge bathroom with separate room for the toilet and separate large shower stall and huge soaker tub with choice of scented bath salts.  High-end Hastens bed, swivel wall-mounted flat screen large TV, desk, 2 upholstered chairs, overstuffed armchair, ottoman, actual balcony facing peaceful courtyard (over George restaurant), and complimentary continental breakfast (coffee ready to order) and honour bar (several full-size bottles but no gin; two kinds of wine and assorted beers kept on ice) available just outside the room for in-room enjoyment.  \\n\\nBeing a Saturday\\u002FSunday, the business centre\\u002Flibrary area of the private women's club upstairs was empty and the concierge said I could use it.  Although the gorgeous basement-level pool, hot tub, and spa area is women-only, I still recommend this place to couples if the man can skip that part.  We got the urban one-night getaway package, so a 4 course tasting menu at George was included.  The service at George was a little rough -- we weren't offered any upgrades or wine pairings and the amuse bouche and first two courses came out too quickly --  we hadn't even received our aperitif cocktails yet!\\n\\nIvy is significantly cheaper than staying at Hazelton but now that I've stayed overnight at both, I would choose Ivy again and again.  The only difference is the slightly smaller closet space at Ivy compared to the two-sided closet\\u002Fstorage area in Hazelton rooms, and the lack of a TV in the bathroom at Ivy.  Otherwise the room setup and comfort quality is the same.  Ivy provides Bulgari white tea scented toiletries along with the choice of 3 scented bath salts.  Hazelton provides a fridge in-room stocked only with wine products and teas whereas Ivy gives many choices just outside the room and a free breakfast (Ivy continental included 2 kinds of croissants, jam, apple strudel slices, an interesting coconut oatmeal porridge that tasted great at room temperature, fresh berry fruit salad, choice of orange or grapefruit juice, and hot tea or coffee on demand.)  Yes, Hazelton does room service and has a restaurant open for brunch on site, whereas George at Ivy does not provide that flexibility.  The indoor pool at Hazelton was a huge disappointment (no windows, awful lighting and no relaxation area around the pool) whereas the women-only pool at Ivy is lovely and even has an underwater treadmill!  Queen Street East between Church and Jarvis is no Yorkville.  But for $200+ less on average per night, Ivy offers better value at a similar standard",
            "I stayed at the Ivy in November and it was wonderful! The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated and so serene. I especially love the bathroom, and the special touch of the bath salts \\\"buffet\\\". After a night out at the nearby distillery district, we enjoyed decadent desserts from George in the comfort of our room. The service was great. This was my 3rd time at Ivy and I expect I will return again",
            "We stayed at the Ivy for one night -- our honeymoon -- and it was fantastic. It is truly an oasis in the heart of downtown Toronto and you will be pampered! The beds are so plush, you will not want to get out of bed. We especially enjoyed the very spacious and stylish bathrooms, especially the very large and lovely soaking tub and showers. Can't wait to go back",
            "Beautiful, comfortable,exceeded expectations,highly recommended,luxurious room, delicious breakfast, excellent location near to shopping ( Eaton centre )  close to performing arts centre, free wifi , wonderful staff, felt right at home immediately, quite and cozy,more at coffe shop next doo",
            "My husband and I had a delightful stay at your hotel!  \\n\\nWe had never stayed in a boutique hotel before, and were really impressed by how quiet it was, and the attention to detail our room presented.\\n\\nWe frequently stopped and smelled the fresh roses in our room, and throughout the hotel.  Beautiful!  My husband celebrated the first bath he\\u2019s taken (as an adult), and actually been able to submerse under the water.  He tried each of the epsom salts, and enjoyed each, (I made the mistake of trying the rosemary the first day, and then didn\\u2019t want to try anything else).  I think he\\u2019s considering a bathroom reno after our stay!  The heated floor was a lovely touch, and the shower was quite roomy.  \\n\\nEach day we woke up, one of our first comments was we loved the bed.  We actually visited the Hasten\\u2019s store, and bought one to take home.  I was amazed the salesman, Nicholas, knew what firmness of bed we were sleeping on by our room number.  Wow.  We thought the sheets and pillows were awesome too, (but we would have appreciated trying the Hasten\\u2019s one to know if we should have bought them too!).  I was surprised to learn we were sleeping on a ten year old bed, because it was so cosy and supportive.  I can\\u2019t wait for ours to arrive!\\n\\nI took advantage of the spa and club.  The ladies were welcoming, professional, and eager to please!  Leada, the beautician, was very skilled and helpful.  My nails still look great!\\n\\nWe dined on the 5 course tasters menu at the George restaurant.  It was easily the best meal I\\u2019ve every eaten.  Each course was a delight, (gorgeous and fragrant), and it was an evening\\u2019s entertainment to hear about the wines and food.  Ian, our waiter, was attentive, personable, and knowledgable. \\n\\nThe concierge was usually the young woman (I apologize for not getting her name).  You both were lovely!  While probably not your most demanding clients, we sure enjoyed the hot coffee and tea brought to our room whenever we called, and the quiet determination to make every detail (such as the spa products I liked delivered to my room) perfect!  The continental breakfast and trailmix were delicious!\\n\\nI\\u2019ve already recommended your lovely hotel to others!  I hope there are still rooms available when we next book, we can\\u2019t wait to come back",
            "Stayed here with my husband and baby while attending a wedding at the connected George Restaurant below the hotel. Both hotel and restaurant were exceptional. Only regret is that I didn't take a bath in the beautiful tub. The bath salts laid out looked truly divine! My husband could not get enough of the big shower.",
            "I absolutely love the Ivy Hotel and have stayed there several times.  It is a perfect retreat for a romantic get away with your partner and there are several packages available which include dinner at the hotel's George Restaurant.   I have also used the Ivy when having a girls' day with my sister, niece and mom at the adjacent Sweetgrass Spa and an evening out so the room was nice to come back to.   In addition, I have used the Ivy for business purposes if I book a corporate dinner at George or have meetings downtown the next day, the Ivy is conveniently situated in the downtown core.   The 4 room boutique hotel is luxurious and cozy with a unique ambience.  The staff and service is attentive. I am already looking forward to my next stay",
            "The room is spacious and comfortable, nicely decorated with many conveniences. Huge spa bathroom and a nice sunny balcony too. \\n\\nI can\\u2019t think of any other word for the service than inept. Basic requests were either ignored or handled poorly. \\n\\nDinner at George downstairs was worth the price of admission. \\n\\",
            "This is a really great hotel.  Only 4 rooms but all are super lovely.  The size room is fantastic.  It's beautifully decorated and the bed is truly amazing (I'll be buying a Hastens bed one day!).  Other benefits of staying there are access to Verity club sitting area, access to George's food (the restaurant) via room service and walking down to Sweetgrass spa in your bathrobe.  Staff are super nice as well.  A few things to be aware of....this area is pretty quiet on Sundays.  It's really, really hard to find a place to find lunch (nothing is available from IVY as well as George is closed).  Don't depend on the complimentary breakfast to get your morning started.  The baked goods are OK to bland and there are too many fruit flies flying around the other things (fruit salad, orange juice) to make them appetizing.  That's fine if it's a weekday - as you can step out and go next door to the cafe.  But on Sunday, you're a bit stuck for options.   That said - I can still look pass these small issues and enjoy my stay there!  Worth considering the next time your in Toronto",
            "My husband and I stay in Toronto every few months so like to try different hotels each time. Recent stays have included Intercontinental Yorkville, Pantages, and Ritz-Carlton. For our latest stay, we booked a room at The Ivy at Verity. I can honestly say I've never had a more lovely hotel stay! The staff seemed very proud to work there and were both warm and professional.\\nThe room we stayed in (Room 1) was large and beautifully appointed ... The care they've put into decorating each room is apparent in every fabric and furniture choice. The bed was luxuriously comfortable and the bathroom spoiled us with heated floors, marble vanity and a selection of aromatherapy bath salts. \\nThe common area immediately outside the rooms is a charming space with a large granite table used for drinks in the afternoon and breakfast in the morning. Alcohol was $6 a drink (very reasonable) and done on the honour system...all the drinks were out on the table and you filled out a card with what you drank to bring to the concierge later for payment. Espresso and soda was free as was the wifi and a continental breakfast. That breakfast was also delicious! Large flaky, buttery croissants, yoghurt and granola, hard boiled eggs, and juice were waiting on trays labelled with each room number and you simply rang the concierge to have fresh coffee delivered when you woke up.  \\nI didn't want to leave! I can't wait to try this hotel in the summer and enjoy the lovely terrace.\\nWell done, Ivy... You've created a little oasis in the heart of the city",
            "This is a hotel within a women-only club, so only females have access to the pool, spa and gym.  The rooms are great, and service is excellent, so I didn't mind staying in the room or walking in the neighborhood while my wife enjoyed the facilitie",
            "Exceptional and almost up there with the fastiduously superb hotel 41 in London, or, a favourite, the Charlotte St hotel in Fitzrovia, London. We stayed 2 nights for an anniversary and the staff could not have done more to help make our stay a wonderful experience. Unfortunately the affiliated Georges restaurant was shut the evenings we stayed (Sun\\u002FMon) but we were recomended a superb local steak house (Berberians) and the Georges Lunch on Monday was excellent. \\n\\nOverall a really fabulous stay and our only suggestions would be to put some cheap pens or pencils in the room to note down stuff without having to rummage through the executive carrier bags!\\n\\nOverall a rare gem, but we did feel that it needs to communicate a clear proposition; as a fabulous boutique hotel, a fine dining experience, a club,a ladies health spa, or,  all 4",
            "The rooms at the Ivy are so beautiful, you really don't want to leave them.  Save time to enjoy the spa like bath, with an assortment of scented salts and heated floors - enjoy a drink or breakfast on the balcony overlooking the secluded patio of the George restaurant - and make sure you get your full eight hours sleep in the heavenly beds - amazing comfort and luxury.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, each one with a different interior design, and unlike anything you would get at a large chain hotel.  Within walking distance of downtown Toronto, the Ivy is conveniently located albeit off the beaten path.  We liked being able to enjoy a bottle of champagne in the seating area outside the rooms as a group - almost like being in your own home - before heading downstairs to the wonderful George restaurant. Personal and knowledgable concierge staff - access to Internet and computers - on site spa - and ambience from the exclusive Verity Women's Club.  I have stayed at the Ivy many times, and already am looking forward to my next visit",
            "Who knew that I could travel a half hour from home and feel like I was in Paris?! We had a lovely stay at the Ivy for a 1-night getaway in the city. \\n\\nI can't compliment the hotel and it's staff enough. First and foremost was the European-inspired decor of this chic little boutique hotel - just stunning. With only 4 rooms, it's intimate and cozy, but doesn't feel 'small'.  \\n\\nWonderful spa, library and lounge area. The hotel rooms are excellent -  no detail spared. The walkout to the terrace was a nice surprise. \\n\\nThe 'honesty bar' in the sitting room down the hall was a personalized touch. \\n\\nWill definitely be back",
            "I've been staying in Marriotts, Hiltons and Holiday Inns for over 4 years with work, but it's only by coming to The Ivy that I'm reminded how good a hotel experience you can have if you go to the boutique places.\\nThe first thing is even though this is effectively 'an old boys club for women', my wife booked it for our first trip to Toronto and we both found it to be utterly beautiful, relaxing and a joy to stay in. We could happily move into room 3 and never leave, the bed and bathroom are brilliant, the honesty bar and espresso machine outside the room make you feel at home to come and go as you please, the staff were super friendly and helpful, and even though the spa is women only they allowed us in after hours. As for the George restaurant, we've never had a better tasting menu anywhere in the world. A rare foodie experience I'll not forget in a hurry.\\nOne of those places that genuinely nourishes your body and mind. Can't say enough good things about it",
            "Our room was large and beautifully appointed with eclectic modern decor. \\nThe bathroom was massive, with a separate shower and tub (with complimentary menu of bath salts) and had a spa-like feel. \\nThe concierge was extremely helpful and courteous.\\nComplimentary breakfast is brought to the room (with pastries baked by the chef from the exquisite restaurant downstairs). \\nThe beautiful balcony overlooking the restaurant courtyard is a perfect spot to take breakfast. \\nThe room was very quiet, albeit a bit bright in the morning - I'd recommend blackout curtains. \\nAside from George (downstairs), Origin is another restaurant nearby that is worth a visit",
            "And by that I mean: designed for a posh WASPy grandmothery type. Staying with Granny certainly has it's perks- fresh roses, housemade bath salts, a balcony overlooking the courtyard, as well as being located on top of the formidable George restaurant. She is trying desperately to be hip with her tv remote computer tablet and Hastens mattress. Unfortunately, money cannot buy good taste- the decor was odd, overly floral, with mismatched donated art and a lurid colour scheme. It was nice to have breakfast delivered, and I appreciated using the \\\"breakfast in bed\\\" tray, but there is little choice other than sweet pastries. My husband had to venture down the street for a second breakfast before we left. But perhaps all these vices would be considered virtues by another older more regal woman..... or gay man",
            "The Ivy at Verity ( a private women's club in downtown Toronto) attached to 5 star dining at George Restaurant with it's own private courtyard patio.\\nPosh but cozy, exclusive but welcoming. So beautiful and stylish but with plenty of substance. The people are warm and helpful and the beds are Hastens so the best sleep ever acheived. There is a Verity spa (complete with hot tub, steam room, and sauna ) on property called Sweetgrass that is exclusive for women but men staying in the hotel can have treatments in their hotel room. They even have fitness facilities (again, exclusive to women)  and you can add on a yoga class if you want for a nominal fee.\\nFabulous stay, incredible bed, God is here, in the deails",
            "Room could not have be nicer or more comfortable.\\nI wanted to give all top reviews becauae of this ....but a few things lacking.\\nService was average, there are other things in the building womans club,gym,spa so hotel service was a bit off. Like last on list.\\nThe breakfast was placed so nice, but was not really up to par. Juice and fruit good,but breads were a bit tough with no where to heat. Forgot our turn down service two of the four nights (there are only four rooms) \\",
            "The Ivy is a hidden gem in the centre of Toronto.  Spacious beautifully decorated rooms, luxurious linens and the bathrooms are stocked with the best toiletries - a deep bath and separate shower stall.  You  feel pampered and regenerated.  Great dinner package options at George restaurant and spa options at the spa. Small and personal - treat yourself",
            "This hotel is BEAUTIFUL. Rooms are perfect could not fault in anyway. Love the d\\u00E9cor, pretty balcony with the sound of running water from the fountain downstairs, bathroom is MASSIVE and they provide a menu of bath salts. Very clean and very comfortable bed. The location is also very central and easy walk of the Greyhound bus stop. We felt massively let down by the breakfasts. With the room rate being so high you would expect more. I don't mind that the breakfast is on a tray for you to collect when you wish. As this allowed no time limit to having to get up and it was nice to have in the room still in robes. However what is provided is very limited. As I have a special diet I was given a bowl of chopped fruit. My husband was given one croissant and a small slice of loaf\\u002Fcake. I would expect a gluten free option to be more than just fruit. Surely Canada has some sort of bread\\u002Ffruit bread\\u002Fbreakfast treat. I would stay again but would be buying my own breakfast",
            "This hotel is part of a small, elegant upscale spa and restaurant complex and women's club. The restaurant is superior as are the spa facilities and the rooms.  Decoration is in impeccable taste in every part of the complex.  The beds are British--Hypnos is the brand.  They are ultra-luxury in price; more importantly, they make for an exceptional sleep. We had a perfect escape to an elegant oasis in the middle of Toronto in the winter.  Highly recommended",
            "This centrally located downtown Toronto hotel is extremely spacious, beautifully appointed and impeccably conceived. I'd like to move in. (The continental breakfast delivered to your door, the heated flooring in the very large bathroom, the generous balcony overlooking the intimate brick courtyard, the gorgeous drapes and furniture...) And yes, of course, all the technology required for a 21st century traveler",
            "We live in Toronto and were celebrating- my birthday, my husbands birthday and my best friend's and her husband's birthday all fall within a month of each other, so we decided this year to celebrate in style- a night at the Ivy. We kicked things off first at the Sweetgrass spa (for women only) then enjoyed a 10 course tasting menu on George's beautiful courtyard patio.\\n \\nGoing with another couple allowed me to gawk at their room too (room #1). I love how this hotel has only four rooms and all are tasteful and elegant, and so different. Our room (#3) was a glamorous blend of modern mixed with classic timeless materials, a nod to their chocolate factory past. Gorgeous blue wallpaper is charming against the relic brick of a bygone era. The rooms themselves are massive, much roomier than any other downtown hotel I've seen. With different seating areas to recline and relax, including a sunny deck that faces George's patio, my husband and I loved every minute of our stay. The bathroom has a super deep soaker tub and inviting aromatic bath salts- they have clearly anticipated your every thought! \\nOne feature I loved was the Samsung tablet that you use to control the television, but also acts as a portable TV, which they have linked to Netflix...cue the Orange is the New Black marathon! \\n\\nMy bestie's room was an intimate portrait of a Parisian hotel, soft pink striped wallpaper was welcoming and warm. Her room was every bit as luxurious as mine, every detail carefully constructed. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back, absolutely adore the staff, spa and restaurant here. It's a rare gem in a city full of over-done, over hyped hotels (IMHO). Nice gestures like the honour bar and delicious complimentary breakfast are just the finishing touches to a spoiled brat weekend. Thanks Ivy",
            "Amazing getaway in the heart of Toronto.  Great location, only four rooms in the entire hotel, gorgeous boardrooms, library, balconies.  The hotel rooms are enormous, luxurious, romantic and spotless.  The spa downstairs is just for women (which was kind of wonderful) but the male half of a couple might feel a little left out.  Then he should remind himself that he gets paid more than his wife does to do the same job\\u2026 and go relax in the giant bathtub instead",
            "This hotel is amazing!  Concierge are very helpful and informative. Room 4 was very large, beautifully decorated with a balcony over looking the courtyard.  Lovely bathroom with bathtub, separate shower and heated floor.  Three types of scented bath salts are available for your bathing pleasure!  An honour bar is available with red and white wine and a selection of spirits.  Continental breakfast, including in house freshly baked croissants is left outside your door at 8am.  \\n\\nDinner is highly recommended at the award winning George Restaurant!\\n\\nI give this hotel 10 out of 10!  Can't wait to go back",
            "This place is just fabulous. Beautiful decor and furnishings, the most comfortable hotel bed  I've ever slept in, excellent service and a delicious complimentary continental breakfast(with the hotel's own crab-apple preserve)",
            "Stayed in room #4 for one night. Concierge was so accommodating- helped with parking and showing us all the ammenities. \\nThe room was spacious and beautiful. Large patio. Complimentary bath salt bar over the spa tub, separate stand up shower and toilet rooms. \\nThe hotel also had a bar for guests in a small sitting area outside the room. It worked based on the honesty system- each drink you had you recorded and were charged 6$\\u002Falcoholic beverage at the end of your stay. They had wine, beer, and all sorts of hard liquor + mix. \\nThere was a complimentary continental breakfast waiting on a table outside your room starting at 715- and when you were ready you called the concierge to bring a pot of fresh coffee. \\nOverall lovely, romantic spot. We also purchased the 4 course tasting menu at George which was amazing. Will return!",
            "I took my wife here for spa and a weekend get away. The facilities are wonderful. The atmosphere is very cozy.  Remember this is a more or less a women\\u2019s health club. Everything to do and eat is nearby. We had an excellent stay.  Rooms are gorgeous .  The morning breakfast is so healthy and perfect. I love this place.",
            "The Ivy at Verity is a tiny hotel. The set up seems odd at first... it is an exclusive women's club with gym, spa, library, lounges etc, and tucked away on a upper floor, the 4 lovely and spacious guest rooms.  The rooms overlook a court yard and face the windows of an ad agency, where you can see folks working away. At first it felt a bit like we were in a bedroom at work. We kept our drapes closed and all was well. As a woman, all of the amenities were amazing. I think if I had been travelling with a male companion it would have been disappointing.  I was in room three and it was BEAUTIFUL.  Just my style. Very comfortable king bed, incredible bathroom with an irresistible bathtub. All of the soaps and salts and lotions were really lovely and great quality. The room had lots of plush seating, and huge balcony. The honour bar, just outside of the rooms was a really nice touch - although when I was there it was not properly stocked and was never replenished, even after two calls to the concierge. Location is central enough to walk downtown, has a transit stop right out front, and there is paid parking directly across the street. I thought the breakfast was quite good. This will always be my first choice hotel when I stay in Toronto, I really loved it",
            "I found the Ivy on hotels.com. Thought it sounded unique and it is! Four gorgeously and differently appointed rooms. Huge bathroom with rain shower and deep soaking tub, including in-house-made, complimentary bath salts - a nice touch after a long day of walking. There is an honor bar with white wine, liquors, and soft drinks. Also tea bags and instant coffee. Continental breakfast is included and it is quite ample - yogurt\\u002Fgranola, boiled egg, croissant or muffin, juices, and coffee\\u002Fcream. Really nice.\\n\\nThe only difficulty that I encountered was a previously unannounced electricity outage one night from 10pm to 4am the following morning. WEIRD. A letter left in my room. No explanation. Battery lantern and flashlight provided. \\n\\nThe building is in a sort of run-down block of Queen St just a bit east of the better parts of Queen St West. But I did not feel unsafe. \\n\\nThere is a great women's clothing store a few doors down. Don't miss it! And an excellent antiques store in the the next block east. Plenty of good restaurants a block or two away as well as the upscale George attached.\\n\\nLovely subterranean swimming pool and hot tub. And a spa",
            "What a gem of a hotel.  Beautiful decor, impeccably maintained, and can't say enough about the most comfortable bed we've ever experienced.  The bathroom has heated floors, and the scent of homemade bathsalts (lavender, jasmine and eucalyptus) permeated through to the bedroom.  Would definitely stay there again",
            "Stay here ONLY if you want to feel pampered, rich and completely relaxed. Stay here ONLY if you like complimentary breakfast delivered to your room with fresh-squeezed orange juice and homemade chocolate scones. \\nStay here ONLY if you like the idea of being in the middle of a big city but waking on to your balcony to overlook a garden area that\\u2019s as peaceful as the countryside. \\n\\nThe pictures don\\u2019t lie. It\\u2019s every bit (and better) what the hotels pictures show. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed every second. \\n\\n10\\u002F10 the best hotel we\\u2019ve every stayed in. Thank you The IVY at Verity for giving these two perpetually tired parents their first night away!",
            "Definitely not your usual hotel. Looking for a home away your home.....This is the place where to go when you are in Toronto. Even if not located in some fancy neighborhoods, this place is a gem. At first a \\\"Women's club\\\" , the Ivy offers some rooms now... Mine was .. Yes ... awesome. A large room with a large bed, a pretty big bathroom with for the first time ever of my life a bath salt \\\"bar\\\" ... Breakfast it serve at your door at the requested time. Might be a little bit light (missing some toasts and butter), ordered croissants and chocolate brioche and ends-up with a muffin with grapes   ... But this was good.\\nTeam is great ... I will highly recommend this place ... Especially if you are a woman ... Next time i will try the SPA",
            "We absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was so welcoming and helpful. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was perfect. \\nThis hotel is owned by the women's club and was originally used exclusively by the club for when they had guests in town. Now anyone can book a room if you are lucky enough to nab one. There are only four rooms in the entire hotel and they are separated away from the rest of the club so it is very quiet. The rooms are very large with a king bed and beautiful full wall windows with a door onto a private balcony. Each room is color coded and unique. the bathroom comes with heated floors, a separate room for the toilet, an amazing shower, and the largest bath tub I have ever seen. I am 6'2\\\" and I could stretch out in the tub with room to spare. The added bonus is the in house made bath salt that they provide in three different scents.\\nYou also get breakfast delivered to your door. It is not a large meal but it gets you through to lunch. \\nThe last thing I have to say is that you MUST have dinner at George while you are there. This restaurant specializes in tasting menus for all dietary plans. The biggest benefit is that after your three hour multi -course meal you just have to walk up the hidden staircase to your room (never leaving the building). \\nI will definitely stay here again if ever back in Toronto",
            "Every single detail is perfect here. Only four rooms but someone has put a lot of thought into styling the rooms to perfection. There\\u2019s even a lovely patio so you feel you might be away from the downtown heart of the city. Sherry and cookies await your arrival. We\\u2019ve travelled around the world, and this might be the most imaginatively and beautiful lodging. Bed and linens, of course, are without parallel.\\n\\nHighly recommended. \\n\\nStaff is helpful too.\\n\\nWe would definitely retur",
            "Spent a wonderful weekend in Toronto at The Ivy at Verity.  A boutique hotel with just 4 rooms. Our was beautifully decorated, spacious with an amazing bathroom.   They have thought of everything -- honor bar, round the clock concierge and unique touches like freshly brewed tea to enjoy while you soak in a huge tub soaking in specially chosen bath salts.   It was a truly magical experience.   Can't imagine every staying anywhere else in Toronto.   Book ahead so you won't miss out",
            "This boutique hotel is exactly that. Small, but beautifully put together. Staff were all fantastic. Rooms perfect. Best bathrooms we've found in Canada, and when the weather allows a lovely veranda to sit on. Attached is a ladies health club and spa, and if I lived in Toronto I would join. Can you start one in England  - preferably near where I live \\uD83D\\uDE04 Husband and I had a champagne breakfast to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was lovely",
            "The Ivy is a small unique hotel -  four rooms in total - all different and beautifully appointed.  The beds are the most comfortable ever, with the finest of linens.  Decor is simply gorgeous,  beautiful ly upholstered seating, exposed brick walls and lovely wallpapers, bamboo hardwood floors and bamboo tiles in the luxurious bathrooms. Each room has a balcony overlooking an inner city courtyard.  The Ivy is part of Verity Womens Club and upstairs from George Restaurant.  The club's spa and fitness facilities are open to guests .  You feel like a pampered personal friend  rather than a hotel guest..  A small guest lounge with a marble table with selection of fine spirits and wine is part of the lovely surroundings.  Definitely for discerning independent travellers who like to discover unique and special properties",
            "We stayed here after our wedding before going home to Etobicoke, and I am so happy that we did! We arrived late (about 1am?) and the concierge was there to greet us and take a breakfast order. The room was well-appointed - beautiful furniture, gorgeous lighting, a patio overlooking the courtyard.  The bed was easily the most comfortable I've ever slept on in my life. And the bathroom! HUGE tub, heavenly salts, separate toilet and shower stalls... just to die for. Breakfast was juice, coffee\\u002Ftea, pastries, yogurt & fruit -- and was waiting on a tray for us in the lobby area which also had a nice bar to choose from (though we weren't in the mood to take advantage of it seeing as it was 9am). I would recommend this place to everyone",
            "The Ivy was the last word in luxury - from a $30,000 mattress (should've come with George Clooney!) to marble tiled bathroom and glorious Bulgari amenities. Sound-proofed room, a sumptuous continental breakfast daily to our door and so very much more - from check-in to departure - made this a stay I've not stopped talking about",
            "Strange setting, 4 room hotel inside a women's only networking club in central Toronto.\\nSet in a beautifully renovated industrial complex, the room was a treat to the senses, salts for the bath, special wood floors in the bathroom. Everything about the room was perfect. We also had a beautiful little terrace overlooking a courtyard where we had breakfast.\\nThe affiliated George restaurant was also magnificent, and all the staff was attentive and knowledgable.\\nI loved the place.\\nI'll definitely go back",
            "We always like to stay in what we call small luxury hotels or special places. The Ivy is both. In the hart of a former chocolate factory you find a hotel space that is very special. Great design, fine materials, very quiet airco, fine linen, great shower, lots of space for your clothes and bags. And breakfast is served in your room! At 08.00 it is outside your door, get it in and enjoy all you ordered the evening before. Very nice and helpful staff",
            "A Gem in a perfect location. Where do I begin. I was greeted by a super nice and friendly staff. I was early for an appointment but interested in my wedding possibly there. I met with planner immediately who was a sweetheart. Just for any thinking about a wedding there, the prices can't be beat!  When I returned I was taken up to my room. The hotel is so lush, with velvet, satin,art work, a library and lounge. One of my favourite features is the honour bar which has inexpensive drinks, free pop, and a espresso coffee machine and tea. The best part was it was right out my bedroom door. The continental breakfast was just the right amount and delicious. The room was just WOW!  It was huge and the wonderful scent from the bath crystals was light yet a delight to the senses. The fixtures were unusual and very artsy. The bathroom was huge! Everything was soft and plush from towels, bedding and bath robes. I only had the pleasure of one night so not enough time to explore all the hotel and neighborhood had to offer. The menu was on a tablet, unlike some hotels where they are a bit used and messy. If you needed something, a friendly staff member was there quickly. I really can't say enough about this wonderful hotel and staff!  Thank you for an amazing night",
            "I am amazed by just how relaxing one night in the city actually was.  \\n\\nBut the bed is lovely.  And the aqua wallpaper in #3 is soothing.  And the design, in general, is excellent.  And the bathroom is exquisite (with great soaps and the like).  And they have this nice internal lobby where there's an honour bar and a Nespresso machine, which is actually where we enjoyed our dessert from George.\\n\\nI would've loved to stay for longer (though, well, it's not exactly a cheap stay), and I would've enjoyed the possibility of a massage.  I kind of wish I could stay here more often.  Shame it's not dog-friendly, and shame that the parking isn't included.  But these are definitely minor",
            "I wouldn't have even known this was their unless we were staying there as part of a wedding party, but it was truly a special little oasis in the city.  The room was massive by inner city standards.  There was a king size bed, little sitting are for reading and another one with a little table for eating\\u002Fdrinks.   There was also a large patio with a table overlooking a quiet courtyard.  Never once did it sound like we were in a city.  The bathroom was also huge and had a great assortment of quality soaps including 3 different scents of bath salts.   Room included a continental breakfast.  There also was an open area outside the room with complimentary soft drinks and cocktails for fee.  Would highly recommend this quiet, gem in the city",
            "To start off, the reception greeted me with smiles and hospitality.  The room was extremely clean and set up with bath salts and nice music.  The bed was like drifting on a soft cloud.  The decor and art were stunning and well thought out.  I felt at home and much relaxed in this hotel and didn't want to leave.  Especially after an amazing massage done right in the convenience of my room.  The staff was extremely accommodating and allowed me a late check out, so I could soak in the tub with some lavender bath salts (tub big enough for two).  mmmm...\\n\\nI would return to this hotel at any opportunity I may have",
            "You owe it to yourself ( and to your spouse) to go on quick getaways and this Spa is ideal for that purpose. With Only 4 rooms it does require a bit of planning but once you have been whisked to iour private paradise, the biggest problem will be to get your better half to leave the room ! Starting with a show piece Hastens bed,  Italian linens  your ill undoubtebly have the best sleep of your life! A Wall of windows and french doors open up to  a gorgeous  indoor courtyard. ( I guess a summer visit is required), .\\nWe have now been spoiled for any other hotel room ever again!\\nWe will be back hereoften, often,  often and we look forward to trying George, the restaurant on the main floor.",
            "Things I loved about the Ivy:\\nThe pillows\\nGiant bath and nice bath salts\\nThe fancy ginger ale (Fever Tree)\\nThe hairdryer (no awful travel ones here)\\nThe balcony\\nFree Nespresso\\nThe lovely staff\\nThe Bulgari ammenities (I want to smell like this forever)\\nPretty wallpaper\\nFresh flowers everywher",
            "If you like plush  guesthouses then this is for you. Big rooms, beautiful big bathroom and not far from the nicer parts of town. Extensive basics \\u002Fservices are explained to you upon arrival and so you do feel like you're in a plush guesthouse rather than a efficient luxury hotel. The mini bar and breakfast area (even for in room breakfasts) are in a small shared space. The reception is one of those low down desks hence the guesthouse\\u002F plush b&b feel. Men cannot use any of the spa facilities, not even the gym :( Great for a traveling business woman who spends a lot of time in plush hotels and wants a more the social experience you would get in a b&b\\u002Fguesthouse."

            "great staff, rooms are excellent, renovation in lobby is well done. complimentary breakfast was good and could be expanded. my first choose when staying in Toronto. close to everything, dining shopping. very easy to get to. staff were accommodating for a late checkout. the room upgrade was wonderful",
            "It's not the nicest hotel in Toronto but it checks off all the boxes in terms of everything you'd need from a hotel. Rooms are big with a kitchen, although I didn't use it. There was also a free breakfast, which didn't have a ton of options, but helps with a quick start to the day. The staff are great and I'd probably come back",
            "Had to review! Stayed twice in 1 week, seeing 2 rooms, 1 with kitchen and 1 without. Both were perfectly clean, spacious, well decorated and comfortable.  The staff was very helpful; you got the impression, they all wanted to make sure your stay was the best it could be. Parking ($30 per night) was a little pricey, but easy to use and very convenient, appreciated. The atmosphere on colourful Church street and the convention shops surrounding the hotel greatly added to our seamless, stress free stay. You\\u2019ll definitely feel safe.  Across the street and south 100m is a great coffee shop in the morning and a pub in the evening, providing a perfect start and end to your day.  Do not hesitate to stay at this hotel, period",
            "Room was not ready. Asked for directions for one of a kind show. Lady manager gave taxi for other side of town. Took me over an hour to get to show. Told some staff what she did to me and they said how nasty. Asked to fix things in lou and staff refused. Cold in my room. No privacy in living room with no windows. Asked staff for taxi and disrespectful towards my name. Dogs barking, Etc. Never again stay at this hotel and will find another place. Also had bite marks and perhaps it as bed bugs",
            "The room are fully equipped with Kitchen amenities, they are spacious and comfortable. This hotel is centrally located and easy access to subway and food outlets. Also it is safe location for families who intend to visit Toronto.  Their front office Manager Mr. Vishal was very helpful as he was always available to address our concerns",
            "I booked the Junior Suite with kitchenette, and a washer & dryer. These were extremely useful! It had a full-sized refrigerator and stove, and a dishwasher.  The suite was very, very clean and comfortable. I was on a high floor, with a great eastern view (note that there is construction on the west side.) Front desk staff are very professional and attentive. They recommended the purchase of a monthly parking pass to save me money. I also recommend using transit downtown. The Bloor\\u002FYonge subway interchange is less than a five minute walk away, and the subway is accessible (elevators and escalators - at least in the city core). The neighbourhood is people-friendly, and well served by caf\\u00E9s, restaurants, shopping, and small grocery markets nearby. Internet service was very good. I don\\u2019t have cable tv at home, and enjoyed watching that. NOTE: As with many suite hotels, housekeeping will visit only once per week; I didn\\u2019t need anything, but the front desk would have obtained extra towels, etc. I would have stayed longer if I could have, and the Town Inn will be my base the next time I am in Toronto. Book early so you get a high floor and a better view!  NOTE ALSO: if you park at the hotel, there are stairs from the parking garage to the elevators. I managed fine, but persons with more severe mobility issues will need to be dropped off at the front entrance or use the \\u201CGreen P Parking\\u201D on Charles Street.\\nThis hotel is an exceptional value for the city centre. Thank you, Town Inn!",
            "I cannot say enough about the amazing staff here. Check in and out is easy. The staff are polite, professional and efficient. I overbooked as I was coordinating for family members and they released the extra room with no penalty and no questions asked. Value for money is synonomous with the Town Inn Suites in Toronto, especially at a time when hotel stays have really sky rocketed. This still feels afordable without sacrificing expectations for clean and comfy stays. Having the extra room of a kitchen\\u002Fliving room and a one bedroom was perfect with multiple wedding guests staying here. The continental breakfast was great - croissants, yoghurt and lots of coffee in a clean dining area. There is parking (extra fee) and a an easy in\\u002Fout drive so that checking in and dropping luggage is a breeze. This is a great place to stay when in TO and not far from key areas of interest. We stayed here a few years ago at Christmas also and happily the consistency from then til now is noteworthy",
            "Nice location, walking distance to street cars, restaurants. Staff were friendly. They are very welcoming at the reception, unlike at the hotel we went for an overnight stay in Montreal. Didn\\u2019t expected the complimentary breakfast which is nice and not in a bag. Fresh croissants. Amenities in our room is good",
            "Mediocre at best. I was impressed with the lobby, very clean and modern. I booked the \\\"Luxury King Suite\\\"  which was quoted to have \\\"granite countertops\\\" along with a photo of a lovely suite with an island and dining table. When I unlocked my room, this was not at all what I was given. We had a kitchen with stainless appliances that looked very new - but plain countertops and no island or kitchen table. We had a couch & chair with a marble coffee table along with a TV. They have very clearly tried hard to update the rooms with modern furnishings but have forgotten to update the actual space. The flooring was old & paint stained. The 90s mirrored closet doors don't close properly. The bathroom was very old and the square tiled flooring was stained and nothing was updated but the lighted mirror. The room was clean and all the kitchen appliances etc were present. The bed was very comfy as well. Unfortunately, this room just wasn't what I was expecting to walk into, given the description and photos on the emails\\u002Fwebsite. Overall it was fine for the price I paid for Toronto, I was just disappointed to walk into a very institutional-like room. No paint, art, or wallpaper. Just stark white with no decor. I should add the check-in staff were wonderful! I did not complain or bring my concerns to the front desk because that's just not who I am. I just don't want anyone else to be let down by what is promised vs what they receive",
            "Beautifully renovated, still a few dings in walls etc but very clean. Very attentive staff and clean quiet rooms that look exactly like the photos. Breakfast is continental style but well stocked(except for missing sugar which was quickly rectified). Breakfast room is small so plan on  taking breakfast back to your suite. Location feels safe for a solo female traveller, and has a convenience store across the street. Bloor and Yonge are a short walk away.  \\nThe slippers are a lovely bonus. \\n\\nRegarding some reviews - Anyone who is a seasoned traveler should be aware that hotels do require credit cards. This is a long time well known practice and should not come as a surprise to anyone, it's not the hotels responsibility to inform you directly",
            "We needed a hotel room large enough for 5 women on a \\\"girls night out\\\" and this place fit the bill. We enjoyed the comfort of the two bedroom suite which allowed for a night of card playing, socializing, and cooking h'orderves after we took in a play and had dinner out. It added to our Toronto experience !!!",
            "Nice hotel. Good location. Comfortable bed. And clean and tidy. Staff polite and helpful (the tour firm they recommended for Niagara falls were great and reasonably priced. I even did the boat ride, which was spectacular. ) Some negatives: they clean the room every other day (maybe that is the norm); there were a few broken things in my room (one of the lights and the towel rail); the gym is private and needs to booked and paid for). The breakfast is minimalistic,  but suited me as I don't each much first thing in the morning.  I was on the 27th floor or what they call the PH floor. Overall,  I would consider it again",
            "Great location in Toronto. We stayed in a two bedroom suite with kitchen. The kitchen diner was great with loads of space and air conditioning however the rest of the apartment was tired @nd needed updating. No access to the balcony and a tiny windowless bathroom. No air conditioning anywhere except in the kitchen diner. Continental breakfast was limited in variety. Lots of space and facilities for a group of five however I would not stay here again unless all areas were update",
            "Stayed here for 5 days. The staff are extremely  helpful and efficient and have a professional  style. We were upgraded to a lovely apartment before we left Australia  perhaps  because  we mentioned  that we were on our honeymoon!! Jun couldn't  do enough for us with emails back and forth, prior to us beginning  our trip across  Canada. The Deluxe King Suite was lovely..even has a kettle!!! Kitchen is very modern with good appliances  and full size oven and stove top. Large microwave oven, and very large stainless steel  fridge. The only minus was the free breakfast.  Very basis choices indeed..\\nThere is a decent grocery store at the corner of the next block, which is a few minutes  walk ( a convenience  store is directly across from the hotel) (didn't go to that one). A hairdressing  salon is just around the corner and Croissant  Tree restaurant  is diagonally  opposite.  This eatery is great for any time of the day meals or snacks. Very cheap quality food in a nice setting.. There is a coin laundry in the hotel and an indoor pool. Dog friendly  too. Definitely  would recommend this  hotel",
            "The pictures on the website are not representative of all of the rooms. It shows a bright and clean space. The suite in which my family stayed was dark and definitely dirty. Several of the pieces of furniture had been replaced as per the pictures, but the kitchen was a galley with dark cabinets.\\n\\nIt is obvious that great care is not taken to clean the rooms as a comment card from a previous resident had been left for us to find. It complained about a banana peel which had been left in one of the drawers in the kitchen for them to find.\\n\\nThere is also a mouse problem, we saw a mouse run across the floor.\\n\\nOn a positive note, the on-site parking was convenient and the staff during check-in and check-out were gracious",

I asked if mine could be opened, and was told that they have been locked for years, and could not be opened. The kitchen is fine to keep things in the fridge and heat things up in the microwave, but I wouldn't be excited to cook in it. It does come with an included  breakfast of coffee\\u002Ftea muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit",
            "We use this hotel for our business partners and guests and we cannot be more happier with them. They have a huge pool, the suites are nicely updated and the staff are amazingly helpful and kind. Highly recommended",
            "I stayed in a suite here for 2 weeks while looking for somewhere permanent to rent. My suite was perfectly fine, not high end luxury but not budget either. It had quite a large kitchen and living space, a bathroom (with a shower but not a bath), and a separate bedroom. I wasn't here on holiday so it was nice to have some form of kitchen to cook with. The kitchen had most things you would need.\\n\\nThe bedroom was a little on the small side, partly because there was a huge king sized bed and not much room for anything else. The bathroom was nice, but I had some problems with the hot water in that I had to leave the shower running for 30 minutes sometimes before it got to a reasonable temperature to shower in. Since moving into a condo in Toronto I have the same problem, so I wonder if it's a common thing here.\\n\\nThe wifi was a little slow but functional. I had to sign in again every 24 hours which got irritating given I was there 2 weeks.\\n\\nI stayed here during the COVID-19 pandemic and I was self isolating here after arriving in Canada. The staff were mostly accommodating of this. The only issue I had was requests getting misinterpreted when calling down to reception for something, usually ending up in them bringing the wrong thing or too much of something which was wasteful. Because of the circumstances during my stay, the location made little difference. But if I were getting about, I think I might have found the location a little too far away from the centre",
            "We recently stayed at the Town Inn Suites.  Room were newly renovated, clean, tastefully decorated, spacious, comfortable, and well equipped.  Nothing was lacking.  Staff was cheery, friendly, and super helpful.  It was a truly wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend this place.  Also great was its perfect location to restaurants and shops",

            "I had stayed at this hotel years ago, and I was aware that hotel had gone through renovations but did not know what to expect..  When I booked room originally there wasn't two double beds room available online.  When I checked I asked if one was available, the manager quickly looked into it, and was able to give me a suite, at nominal increase in price.  When I walked in the room I was totally surprised how beautiful it was.  It was very modern, clean, and comfortable, the suite was very large.  It had stove, microwave, dishwasher, where I made good use of the appliances, during my 4 day stay.  The cleaning staff was a very sweet lady, and accommodated me with towels, toiletry, dish washer detergent, etc, I had told her it was ok not to make beds etc, I would take care of it. The location is great spot, close to many amenities, restaurants, shopping, few blocks away from Bloor St.  Wi Fi was free, and used it a lot for work and leisure. I was pleasantly surprised of this hotel and will plan to visit there again",
            "One of the best hotels I've stayed at. The Aircondition worked, so many kitchen appliances, the room was spacious, the bed was big and locations was okay with nearby A&W and other restaurants. We didn't bother with the breakfast anymore hehe",
            "Clean, comfortable and practical accommodation, just as shown in the photograph. Personable check-in staff. We enjoyed a quiet night's sleep.

I would not hesitate to choose Town Inn Suites in future",

The living room was nicely arranged. Really had an excellent time and would have happily stayed longer",

My favourite part of the entire experience- the room and the sheets smelled fresh unlike that usual stale, hotel smell. The bathroom sink was perfectly functional. Some of you may be chuckling at this, but I seem to experience the clogged\\u002Fslow sink very often at my hotel stays(some of them 4 and 5 stars). It seems that by the time I do my nightly washing the sink gets full that the next person can't even use it. \\nThe checkout went smooth and I was even asked if a ride needed to be arranged for me! Very, very professional and pleasant staff!!",
            "We booked a suite here for a 4 day stay in Toronto. The suite was fairly spacious, but in our suite there was not so much as even a small refrigerator or a coffee maker. There was a balcony that was locked, so no way to access it.  The bathroom would have been good, but there was only one towel rack in the whole place. The rooms seemed cold and needed something to warm them up, such as throw pillows.   Breakfast was short and sparse. It ended at 9 AM. I got there at 8:50 to an empty coffee pot. I asked the attendant to bring more coffee. She smiled and said, That's It for coffee for the day. Unbelievable! What kind of hospitality it that? The breakfast room was tiny, not even close to big enough for a hotel this size. In short, I found this hotel to have lots of potential, but very little of it was realized. They need to up their game",
            "We stay at the town suites inn. This place is an older apartment building that has been upgraded. Rooms were clean.. the room was very hot even with the heat turned off. You cant go out on the balcony they are locked. They dont have anywhere in the bathroom to hang your shower towels..staff are polite",
            "We come with a group of 20+ people. The prices are really fair for the rooms we got. Spacious living room with a lot of facilities such as dish washer. Though it's a pity the balcony could not be accessed. Pool and gyms are closed due to the Covid. The staff were super helpful with the recommendations and even helped us to find agencies to book some trips. The service was fast when we needed something. Great location as well,  the street behind the hotel has a lot of restaurants and bars. Close to Eaton Centre",
            "Out first impression was of course the lobby and it was clean, well kept with a friendly face at the concierge desk. We were directed to the front desk which is in a closed off glass room! Keeping the lobby quiet. Staff was polite and helpful. When we reached our room we were pleasantly surprised as the suite was spotless, modern and inviting. Same for bathroom and bedroom! Visiting during a crazy time with the Coronavirus in full panic mode we still sprayed Lysol everywhere but there wasn\\u2019t a fingerprint to be found and it felt like we were the first to ever stay in this room. We highly recommend for all those reasons but the location was also ideal for us",
            "Went to spend a week-end In Toronto and came across this fabulous place, booked on line. The front staff service was amazing , very happy and welcoming staff. Our room was beautiful, King size bed with Fully equipped Kitchen , living room. Our room was very clean ,everything we needed was there, such an amazing place , parking is on premises , and breakfast offered is across the street. The pool was not opened at this time, understanding, but look forward to our next visit. amazin",
            "We booked a \\u201Cluxury suite.\\u201D  While it was spacious and had large windows, there was nothing luxurious about it. The place screamed \\u201Cdeferred maintenance.\\u201D  Furniture was old, tired, and uncomfortable. Extensive water damage in the bathroom. What was described as granite countertops were plastic. Everything about this suite screams \\u201Ccheap\\u201D from the poor quality flooring to the tiny televisions. To make matters worse, the hotel has no gym, which I consider unacceptable in 2024. There is actually a gym in the building but the hotel has no arrangement for guests to use it. I am really regretting booking at this place",
            "We had a 2 bedroom suite which was perfect for our family. The room was nicely decorated, clean, the beds were comfy and staff were polite and helpful. There are 2 metro stations within a 5-10 minute walk so it\\u2019s easy to get around Toronto. Would definitely recommend",
            "We had a really excellent stay. The room was clean. The hotel manager and his staff are so friendly and efficient - they are like a family. Excellent location downtown. Everything you will need is in the apartment and the kitchen is fully equipped. The Wifi is fast and reliable. Would definitely recommend this place",
            "This is an excellent accommodation for anyone seeking a little more room than what a standard hotel offers. Sure there are signs of wear and tear throughout, but the rates are excellent, and the rooms are so spacious. Also, the customer service was absolutely fantastic. All the staff we interacted seemed attentive and willing to go the extra mile to help their guests",
            "I was looking for a place that had a kitchen, and so this hotel provided a great full kitchen. But the suite was extremely bland, with laminate floors, plain walls, and Ikea-style furnishings. No personality at all. The room was large but I would have gladly given up half the space for an ounce of elegance and aesthetic appeal. The old-fashioned heating unit never got the room temperature above 19 degrees and so I had to get a space heater in order to bring the room to a comfortable temperature. Despite the website saying that the hotel had been renovated, the bathroom was the style of a Motel 6. The bathtub was strongly stained, giving it a very shabby appearance. There was no hook to hang bath towels. On the plus side, the parkade was very convenient, running $30\\u002Fnight. The staff was extremely friendly, with a very pleasant check-in. One drawback that is not due to the hotel itself is that it is directly across the street from a large construction site. Construction began at 6 am, hence not allowing for a full night\\u2019s sleep",
            "My wife and I spent 5 nights here. The location was close to the gay village neighbourhood and high-end Yorkville Ave. We were able to walk to most things we wanted to explore. \\n\\nThe hotel room was a cute, cozy, and clean apartment. We had a full kitchen, living space, bedroom, and bathroom with a rainfall shower. It was everything we needed to have a relaxing space to enjoy after a long day of exploring. \\n\\nWe only used housekeeping once since we were only there a few days. If we requested clean towels or toilet paper from the front desk it was brought up in less than 5 minutes. \\n\\nA classic continental breakfast of muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit was provided each morning. \\n\\nWe stayed in a \\u201Cluxury king suite, one bedroom\\u201D booked through Hotels. ca and the room was wonderful. I\\u2019d stay here again",
            "I booked several rooms for the family and got a group rate as we were coming down to Toronto for a wedding. The service was excellent, they were very accommodating and the rooms were nice, clean and very spacious. Only thing that was not so great was that my sister got an older looking room on the 2nd floor and everyone else got nice renovated rooms in the higher floors. I would recommend this hotel to friends and families",
            "We took a family suite at $400\\u002Fnight in Nov - parking an extra $30. The suite is well appointed, clean & comfortable. The hotel is very central in D\\u002FT Toronto everything is close. the staff is nice.\\nWhat it lacks is amenities - there is barely enough crockery & cutlery for 4 people, 2 cooking pans, 2 cooking utensils, no paper towels, no salt\\u002Fpepper, 2 tissue boxes, 2 sets of towels, 1 bar of soap for 5 people, coffee pods never replenished. I twice asked the reception for towels which never came. Toiletries were never replenished during our stay.\\nThe heater didnt work, which they came & fixed very quickly.\\nA good place but certainly not worth the price",
            "I'm always so impressed with the suites. They are spacious and are well stocked. The king size bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were soft. There were two TVs in the suite and the WiFi worked extremely well. The whole place is very queen and the staff is always friendly.",
            "Recently stayed here with some friends.  Stayed in 2 bedroom suite. Upon arriving entered hotel lobby which was decorated beautifully recently renovated. Staff was very informative and detailed. On what hotel offered. Hotel offers complimentary breakfast from 7am again lounge is nicely decorated and updated. Has a pool and sauna for your personal use.   Hotel is in an amazing location close to all attractions and walking location to shops. Hotel staff was very helpful Assisting with our needs. Room was modern and nicely decorated. Only thing about this hotel is there is a $1000 deposit required for stay even though we  only spending one night. However due to the hotel amenities inside the room fridge stove microwave and newly update could understand why. When booking wanting great location and feeling the comforts of home away from home this is a great place to stay",
            "The Place is close to Downtown.  This neighborhood is known as \\u201Cgay Village\\u201D.  It\\u2019s not a problem for us, but some may don\\u2019t like.  People from the hotel were very nice.  In fact, our suite was a huge apartment complete, with 2 bed rooms, kitchen And 1 bathroom.   No breakfast.   Ideal for familys and thouse who travel in small groups",
            "Suites are spacious, stylish and comfortable. Great location! Seems to be no daily room service but fresh towels were delivered to our door without delay when we asked one evening. Staff very professional and helpful.\\n\\nBe aware that they put a large security deposit on your credit card as if you are renting an apartment (which you basically are). Ours was $500 for a king suite",
            "My family and I, including 2 cats,  had to find an affordable place to stay while we were putting our condo on the market to sell. The location had to have a full kitchen and enough space for us all and more importantly would allow flexibility on the duration and of course accept pets.  Town Inn Suites was just the spot in the city. Super friendly, kind and professional staff, amazing location, clean and very diligent when it came to bring us items we needed",
            "Great hotel for a family with plenty of space to keep everyone happy.  Fully equipped kitchen which we used mainly for the fridge, has dishes and cutlery, as well as a corkscrew.\\n\\nHousekeeping daily for new towels, emptied trash, and made beds.\\n\\nBreakfast is limited, but you can bring back to the room"

            "Every single detail is perfect here. Only four rooms but someone has put a lot of thought into styling the rooms to perfection. There\\u2019s even a lovely patio so you feel you might be away from the downtown heart of the city. Sherry and cookies await your arrival. We\\u2019ve travelled around the world, and this might be the most imaginatively and beautiful lodging. Bed and linens, of course, are without parallel.\\n\\nHighly recommended. \\n\\nStaff is helpful too.\\n\\nWe would definitely retur",
            "We absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was so welcoming and helpful. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was perfect. \\nThis hotel is owned by the women's club and was originally used exclusively by the club for when they had guests in town. Now anyone can book a room if you are lucky enough to nab one. There are only four rooms in the entire hotel and they are separated away from the rest of the club so it is very quiet. The rooms are very large with a king bed and beautiful full wall windows with a door onto a private balcony. Each room is color coded and unique. the bathroom comes with heated floors, a separate room for the toilet, an amazing shower, and the largest bath tub I have ever seen. I am 6'2\\\" and I could stretch out in the tub with room to spare. The added bonus is the in house made bath salt that they provide in three different scents.\\nYou also get breakfast delivered to your door. It is not a large meal but it gets you through to lunch. \\nThe last thing I have to say is that you MUST have dinner at George while you are there. This restaurant specializes in tasting menus for all dietary plans. The biggest benefit is that after your three hour multi -course meal you just have to walk up the hidden staircase to your room (never leaving the building). \\nI will definitely stay here again if ever back in Toronto",
            "Got a chance to stay at Ivy in colourful Room 3 (each of the 4 rooms is different in size or decor) on a Saturday night.  Pure bliss!  Huge bathroom with separate room for the toilet and separate large shower stall and huge soaker tub with choice of scented bath salts.  High-end Hastens bed, swivel wall-mounted flat screen large TV, desk, 2 upholstered chairs, overstuffed armchair, ottoman, actual balcony facing peaceful courtyard (over George restaurant), and complimentary continental breakfast (coffee ready to order) and honour bar (several full-size bottles but no gin; two kinds of wine and assorted beers kept on ice) available just outside the room for in-room enjoyment.  \\n\\nBeing a Saturday\\u002FSunday, the business centre\\u002Flibrary area of the private women's club upstairs was empty and the concierge said I could use it.  Although the gorgeous basement-level pool, hot tub, and spa area is women-only, I still recommend this place to couples if the man can skip that part.  We got the urban one-night getaway package, so a 4 course tasting menu at George was included.  The service at George was a little rough -- we weren't offered any upgrades or wine pairings and the amuse bouche and first two courses came out too quickly --  we hadn't even received our aperitif cocktails yet!\\n\\nIvy is significantly cheaper than staying at Hazelton but now that I've stayed overnight at both, I would choose Ivy again and again.  The only difference is the slightly smaller closet space at Ivy compared to the two-sided closet\\u002Fstorage area in Hazelton rooms, and the lack of a TV in the bathroom at Ivy.  Otherwise the room setup and comfort quality is the same.  Ivy provides Bulgari white tea scented toiletries along with the choice of 3 scented bath salts.  Hazelton provides a fridge in-room stocked only with wine products and teas whereas Ivy gives many choices just outside the room and a free breakfast (Ivy continental included 2 kinds of croissants, jam, apple strudel slices, an interesting coconut oatmeal porridge that tasted great at room temperature, fresh berry fruit salad, choice of orange or grapefruit juice, and hot tea or coffee on demand.)  Yes, Hazelton does room service and has a restaurant open for brunch on site, whereas George at Ivy does not provide that flexibility.  The indoor pool at Hazelton was a huge disappointment (no windows, awful lighting and no relaxation area around the pool) whereas the women-only pool at Ivy is lovely and even has an underwater treadmill!  Queen Street East between Church and Jarvis is no Yorkville.  But for $200+ less on average per night, Ivy offers better value at a similar standard",
            "Stayed here with my husband and baby while attending a wedding at the connected George Restaurant below the hotel. Both hotel and restaurant were exceptional. Only regret is that I didn't take a bath in the beautiful tub. The bath salts laid out looked truly divine! My husband could not get enough of the big shower.",
            "We had an excellent time here. The massage package with the room for two can be used by one person for the full hour by a RMT therapist. The breakfast consisted of coffee, a choice of freshly squeezed juice, pastry's, fresh fruit offered on a tray outside of your room. They have a small area to sit or you can bring your tray to your room.\\nThe hallways are so confusing of how to get to your room or even how to get to the reception area, although they were very accommodating to help you find your way. It was a nice treat with the spa downstairs for the following day.\\nVery close to the Eaton Centre. A great part of the city. It truly was a welcomed treat",
            "The Ivy was the last word in luxury - from a $30,000 mattress (should've come with George Clooney!) to marble tiled bathroom and glorious Bulgari amenities. Sound-proofed room, a sumptuous continental breakfast daily to our door and so very much more - from check-in to departure - made this a stay I've not stopped talking about",
            "Love this place, love Toronto.  Been here 3x in the past year and will be returning soon.  Beautiful retreat.  Wonderful to walk downstairs to George for dinner, to the spa for a massage, or up the street to the subway to get around the city.  Staff is first rate, attentive, and respectful of my privacy. It's expensive but the price is fair",
            "I stayed at the Ivy in November and it was wonderful! The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated and so serene. I especially love the bathroom, and the special touch of the bath salts \\\"buffet\\\". After a night out at the nearby distillery district, we enjoyed decadent desserts from George in the comfort of our room. The service was great. This was my 3rd time at Ivy and I expect I will return again",
            "Things I loved about the Ivy:\\nThe pillows\\nGiant bath and nice bath salts\\nThe fancy ginger ale (Fever Tree)\\nThe hairdryer (no awful travel ones here)\\nThe balcony\\nFree Nespresso\\nThe lovely staff\\nThe Bulgari ammenities (I want to smell like this forever)\\nPretty wallpaper\\nFresh flowers everywher",
            "The Ivy at Verity is a tiny hotel. The set up seems odd at first... it is an exclusive women's club with gym, spa, library, lounges etc, and tucked away on a upper floor, the 4 lovely and spacious guest rooms.  The rooms overlook a court yard and face the windows of an ad agency, where you can see folks working away. At first it felt a bit like we were in a bedroom at work. We kept our drapes closed and all was well. As a woman, all of the amenities were amazing. I think if I had been travelling with a male companion it would have been disappointing.  I was in room three and it was BEAUTIFUL.  Just my style. Very comfortable king bed, incredible bathroom with an irresistible bathtub. All of the soaps and salts and lotions were really lovely and great quality. The room had lots of plush seating, and huge balcony. The honour bar, just outside of the rooms was a really nice touch - although when I was there it was not properly stocked and was never replenished, even after two calls to the concierge. Location is central enough to walk downtown, has a transit stop right out front, and there is paid parking directly across the street. I thought the breakfast was quite good. This will always be my first choice hotel when I stay in Toronto, I really loved it",
            "The room is spacious and comfortable, nicely decorated with many conveniences. Huge spa bathroom and a nice sunny balcony too. \\n\\nI can\\u2019t think of any other word for the service than inept. Basic requests were either ignored or handled poorly. \\n\\nDinner at George downstairs was worth the price of admission. \\n\\",
            "My husband and I received an 'Urban Retreat' package as a wedding gift, and were blown away by this hotel and The George Restaurant when we finally got around to booking and coming for a little getaway.\\nThe service was phenomenal (front desk, spa and George restaurant!), the food amazing, the room gorgeous and unique.. so many little details were attended to. We are definitely going to give this as a gift to a family member who is getting married in the fall.\\n*the only tiny thing I'd say that could be improved is the coffee they served us in the morning. It tasted sort of musty and wasn't very warm",
            "Our room was large and beautifully appointed with eclectic modern decor. \\nThe bathroom was massive, with a separate shower and tub (with complimentary menu of bath salts) and had a spa-like feel. \\nThe concierge was extremely helpful and courteous.\\nComplimentary breakfast is brought to the room (with pastries baked by the chef from the exquisite restaurant downstairs). \\nThe beautiful balcony overlooking the restaurant courtyard is a perfect spot to take breakfast. \\nThe room was very quiet, albeit a bit bright in the morning - I'd recommend blackout curtains. \\nAside from George (downstairs), Origin is another restaurant nearby that is worth a visit",
            "I've been staying in Marriotts, Hiltons and Holiday Inns for over 4 years with work, but it's only by coming to The Ivy that I'm reminded how good a hotel experience you can have if you go to the boutique places.\\nThe first thing is even though this is effectively 'an old boys club for women', my wife booked it for our first trip to Toronto and we both found it to be utterly beautiful, relaxing and a joy to stay in. We could happily move into room 3 and never leave, the bed and bathroom are brilliant, the honesty bar and espresso machine outside the room make you feel at home to come and go as you please, the staff were super friendly and helpful, and even though the spa is women only they allowed us in after hours. As for the George restaurant, we've never had a better tasting menu anywhere in the world. A rare foodie experience I'll not forget in a hurry.\\nOne of those places that genuinely nourishes your body and mind. Can't say enough good things about it",
            "We always like to stay in what we call small luxury hotels or special places. The Ivy is both. In the hart of a former chocolate factory you find a hotel space that is very special. Great design, fine materials, very quiet airco, fine linen, great shower, lots of space for your clothes and bags. And breakfast is served in your room! At 08.00 it is outside your door, get it in and enjoy all you ordered the evening before. Very nice and helpful staff",
            "Not only our favorite place in Toronto, the Ivy at Verity is one of the nicest and most perfects hotels we have ever stayed at.  My mom and I, who take a trip every year, enjoyed the spacious and intricately decorated Room # 3.  Everything was spotless, comfortable, and beautiful.  Every detail of this \\\"hotel\\\" (more like an oasis) was designed and thought through.  I oftentimes found myself wanting to return to the Ivy and other areas of Verity (Sweetgrass Spa, Member's lounge, Library, Computer area) to lounge in the chairs, hang out on the room's large private patio, have a drink at the private honor bar, or take a dip in the pool or bath (prepared with salts and tea preparations).  The concierge was available 24hrs and extremely kind and helpful in accommodating any of our needs or desires, altering our daily delivered breakfasts, making reservations and offering suggestions catered to our likes, and personally introducing us to the host at George Restaurant before our reservation.  We cannot say enough good things about the Ivy\\u002FVerity\\u002FSweetgrass Spa, where you can find every amenity at high quality, spectacular service, and a beautiful ambience.  It is private but alive, and suited for a getaway, for business, and for romance.  With an entrance through Verity, as well as a private entrance (with secure coded door) for the rooms, a guest can customize his\\u002Fher stay.  The location was central to many places such as a few blocks from the subway, or a walk to St. Lawrence Market\\u002FDundas.  We cannot wait to return and could have enjoyed many more days at the Ivy at Verity!  Thank you for a wonderful experience",
            "What a gem of a hotel.  Beautiful decor, impeccably maintained, and can't say enough about the most comfortable bed we've ever experienced.  The bathroom has heated floors, and the scent of homemade bathsalts (lavender, jasmine and eucalyptus) permeated through to the bedroom.  Would definitely stay there again",
            "Great hotel, unique experience. Highly recommended. George Restaurant was also amazing. Friendly staff, good breakfast and complimentary drinks all day. We also liked the spa, which is for women only. A bit weird neighborhood, but quite close to everything",
            "We stayed here after our wedding before going home to Etobicoke, and I am so happy that we did! We arrived late (about 1am?) and the concierge was there to greet us and take a breakfast order. The room was well-appointed - beautiful furniture, gorgeous lighting, a patio overlooking the courtyard.  The bed was easily the most comfortable I've ever slept on in my life. And the bathroom! HUGE tub, heavenly salts, separate toilet and shower stalls... just to die for. Breakfast was juice, coffee\\u002Ftea, pastries, yogurt & fruit -- and was waiting on a tray for us in the lobby area which also had a nice bar to choose from (though we weren't in the mood to take advantage of it seeing as it was 9am). I would recommend this place to everyone",
            "Who knew that I could travel a half hour from home and feel like I was in Paris?! We had a lovely stay at the Ivy for a 1-night getaway in the city. \\n\\nI can't compliment the hotel and it's staff enough. First and foremost was the European-inspired decor of this chic little boutique hotel - just stunning. With only 4 rooms, it's intimate and cozy, but doesn't feel 'small'.  \\n\\nWonderful spa, library and lounge area. The hotel rooms are excellent -  no detail spared. The walkout to the terrace was a nice surprise. \\n\\nThe 'honesty bar' in the sitting room down the hall was a personalized touch. \\n\\nWill definitely be back",
            "I am amazed by just how relaxing one night in the city actually was.  \\n\\nBut the bed is lovely.  And the aqua wallpaper in #3 is soothing.  And the design, in general, is excellent.  And the bathroom is exquisite (with great soaps and the like).  And they have this nice internal lobby where there's an honour bar and a Nespresso machine, which is actually where we enjoyed our dessert from George.\\n\\nI would've loved to stay for longer (though, well, it's not exactly a cheap stay), and I would've enjoyed the possibility of a massage.  I kind of wish I could stay here more often.  Shame it's not dog-friendly, and shame that the parking isn't included.  But these are definitely minor",
            "Strange setting, 4 room hotel inside a women's only networking club in central Toronto.\\nSet in a beautifully renovated industrial complex, the room was a treat to the senses, salts for the bath, special wood floors in the bathroom. Everything about the room was perfect. We also had a beautiful little terrace overlooking a courtyard where we had breakfast.\\nThe affiliated George restaurant was also magnificent, and all the staff was attentive and knowledgable.\\nI loved the place.\\nI'll definitely go back",
            "The Ivy is a small unique hotel -  four rooms in total - all different and beautifully appointed.  The beds are the most comfortable ever, with the finest of linens.  Decor is simply gorgeous,  beautiful ly upholstered seating, exposed brick walls and lovely wallpapers, bamboo hardwood floors and bamboo tiles in the luxurious bathrooms. Each room has a balcony overlooking an inner city courtyard.  The Ivy is part of Verity Womens Club and upstairs from George Restaurant.  The club's spa and fitness facilities are open to guests .  You feel like a pampered personal friend  rather than a hotel guest..  A small guest lounge with a marble table with selection of fine spirits and wine is part of the lovely surroundings.  Definitely for discerning independent travellers who like to discover unique and special properties",
            "Definitely not your usual hotel. Looking for a home away your home.....This is the place where to go when you are in Toronto. Even if not located in some fancy neighborhoods, this place is a gem. At first a \\\"Women's club\\\" , the Ivy offers some rooms now... Mine was .. Yes ... awesome. A large room with a large bed, a pretty big bathroom with for the first time ever of my life a bath salt \\\"bar\\\" ... Breakfast it serve at your door at the requested time. Might be a little bit light (missing some toasts and butter), ordered croissants and chocolate brioche and ends-up with a muffin with grapes   ... But this was good.\\nTeam is great ... I will highly recommend this place ... Especially if you are a woman ... Next time i will try the SPA",
            "We stayed at the Ivy for one night -- our honeymoon -- and it was fantastic. It is truly an oasis in the heart of downtown Toronto and you will be pampered! The beds are so plush, you will not want to get out of bed. We especially enjoyed the very spacious and stylish bathrooms, especially the very large and lovely soaking tub and showers. Can't wait to go back",
            "Spent a wonderful weekend in Toronto at The Ivy at Verity.  A boutique hotel with just 4 rooms. Our was beautifully decorated, spacious with an amazing bathroom.   They have thought of everything -- honor bar, round the clock concierge and unique touches like freshly brewed tea to enjoy while you soak in a huge tub soaking in specially chosen bath salts.   It was a truly magical experience.   Can't imagine every staying anywhere else in Toronto.   Book ahead so you won't miss out",
            "We just spent one blissful night at The Ivy at Verity. Could have stayed longer but the hotel was fully booked for the rest of the week. However, even the one night was enough for us to enjoy the wonderful surprises that this hotel offers. This place is a piece of heaven, when you enter the hotel through the Club \\\"Verity\\\" you are transported into another dimension, where your every wish is fulfilled. Our room was tasteful as it was beautiful, colors that soothe, bed linens that feel like \\\"cloud 9\\\", nothing missing or lacking. Best of all, we get to use the facilities of Verity's Sweetgrass Spa, and wine & dine at \\\"George\\\" Verity's 5-star restaurant, all under the same roof. After one night I am refreshed and rejuvenated, as if I spent a week at a resort. A place like this is hard to find, lucky for me I found it. Can't wait to return",
            "The Ivy is a hidden gem in the centre of Toronto.  Spacious beautifully decorated rooms, luxurious linens and the bathrooms are stocked with the best toiletries - a deep bath and separate shower stall.  You  feel pampered and regenerated.  Great dinner package options at George restaurant and spa options at the spa. Small and personal - treat yourself",
            "This hotel is amazing!  Concierge are very helpful and informative. Room 4 was very large, beautifully decorated with a balcony over looking the courtyard.  Lovely bathroom with bathtub, separate shower and heated floor.  Three types of scented bath salts are available for your bathing pleasure!  An honour bar is available with red and white wine and a selection of spirits.  Continental breakfast, including in house freshly baked croissants is left outside your door at 8am.  \\n\\nDinner is highly recommended at the award winning George Restaurant!\\n\\nI give this hotel 10 out of 10!  Can't wait to go back",
            "The rooms at the Ivy are so beautiful, you really don't want to leave them.  Save time to enjoy the spa like bath, with an assortment of scented salts and heated floors - enjoy a drink or breakfast on the balcony overlooking the secluded patio of the George restaurant - and make sure you get your full eight hours sleep in the heavenly beds - amazing comfort and luxury.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, each one with a different interior design, and unlike anything you would get at a large chain hotel.  Within walking distance of downtown Toronto, the Ivy is conveniently located albeit off the beaten path.  We liked being able to enjoy a bottle of champagne in the seating area outside the rooms as a group - almost like being in your own home - before heading downstairs to the wonderful George restaurant. Personal and knowledgable concierge staff - access to Internet and computers - on site spa - and ambience from the exclusive Verity Women's Club.  I have stayed at the Ivy many times, and already am looking forward to my next visit",
            "We chose the Ivy's Urban Retreat package for one night as a way to celebrate our anniversary in Toronto. In the city, there are no shortage of luxury hotel options, but it can be difficult to find a place to stay that is really in the \\\"boutique\\\" category while offering privacy, luxury, fun, and peace while away from home. In just about every category for evaluation, the Ivy excels. This 4-room hotel downtown stands out and above other options in Toronto, and we're thrilled to have discovered it.\\n\\nYou can request a particular room when booking, and we chose room #2. With a calming colour scheme, plenty of space, a gorgeous marble bathroom (deep tub and huge shower room!), and a large flat screen with a blu-ray player, it's well-outfitted, comfortable, and very quiet. You have access to a refreshments area with honour bar and complimentary soft drinks, as well as access to the members only lounge area, which we didn't make use of. Their packages have incredible value, and we had the chance to enjoy an included five-course meal at the onsite George restaurant and an hour long massage at the onsite Sweetgrass spa. \\n\\nTo clarify some confusion amongst the reviews and elsewhere, Verity is the parent company here and responsible for the spa and restaurant, as well as the hotel. The spa (and this includes all available fitness facilities) is women only, but this absolutely does not mean that men are somehow unwelcome. In fact, should you wish, men can request in-room spa services. As a male guest, I absolutely loved my stay here, and my partner was able to make use of the beautiful spa facilities. \\n\\nToronto seems to be a city where it can be difficult to feel as if value matches cost for accommodations. The Ivy at Verity bucks this unfortunate trend and offers an experience we hope to someday return for",
            "Stay here ONLY if you want to feel pampered, rich and completely relaxed. Stay here ONLY if you like complimentary breakfast delivered to your room with fresh-squeezed orange juice and homemade chocolate scones. \\nStay here ONLY if you like the idea of being in the middle of a big city but waking on to your balcony to overlook a garden area that\\u2019s as peaceful as the countryside. \\n\\nThe pictures don\\u2019t lie. It\\u2019s every bit (and better) what the hotels pictures show. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed every second. \\n\\n10\\u002F10 the best hotel we\\u2019ve every stayed in. Thank you The IVY at Verity for giving these two perpetually tired parents their first night away!",
            "If you like plush  guesthouses then this is for you. Big rooms, beautiful big bathroom and not far from the nicer parts of town. Extensive basics \\u002Fservices are explained to you upon arrival and so you do feel like you're in a plush guesthouse rather than a efficient luxury hotel. The mini bar and breakfast area (even for in room breakfasts) are in a small shared space. The reception is one of those low down desks hence the guesthouse\\u002F plush b&b feel. Men cannot use any of the spa facilities, not even the gym :( Great for a traveling business woman who spends a lot of time in plush hotels and wants a more the social experience you would get in a b&b\\u002Fguesthouse.",
            "I wouldn't have even known this was their unless we were staying there as part of a wedding party, but it was truly a special little oasis in the city.  The room was massive by inner city standards.  There was a king size bed, little sitting are for reading and another one with a little table for eating\\u002Fdrinks.   There was also a large patio with a table overlooking a quiet courtyard.  Never once did it sound like we were in a city.  The bathroom was also huge and had a great assortment of quality soaps including 3 different scents of bath salts.   Room included a continental breakfast.  There also was an open area outside the room with complimentary soft drinks and cocktails for fee.  Would highly recommend this quiet, gem in the city",
            "I absolutely love the Ivy Hotel and have stayed there several times.  It is a perfect retreat for a romantic get away with your partner and there are several packages available which include dinner at the hotel's George Restaurant.   I have also used the Ivy when having a girls' day with my sister, niece and mom at the adjacent Sweetgrass Spa and an evening out so the room was nice to come back to.   In addition, I have used the Ivy for business purposes if I book a corporate dinner at George or have meetings downtown the next day, the Ivy is conveniently situated in the downtown core.   The 4 room boutique hotel is luxurious and cozy with a unique ambience.  The staff and service is attentive. I am already looking forward to my next stay",
            "I found the Ivy on hotels.com. Thought it sounded unique and it is! Four gorgeously and differently appointed rooms. Huge bathroom with rain shower and deep soaking tub, including in-house-made, complimentary bath salts - a nice touch after a long day of walking. There is an honor bar with white wine, liquors, and soft drinks. Also tea bags and instant coffee. Continental breakfast is included and it is quite ample - yogurt\\u002Fgranola, boiled egg, croissant or muffin, juices, and coffee\\u002Fcream. Really nice.\\n\\nThe only difficulty that I encountered was a previously unannounced electricity outage one night from 10pm to 4am the following morning. WEIRD. A letter left in my room. No explanation. Battery lantern and flashlight provided. \\n\\nThe building is in a sort of run-down block of Queen St just a bit east of the better parts of Queen St West. But I did not feel unsafe. \\n\\nThere is a great women's clothing store a few doors down. Don't miss it! And an excellent antiques store in the the next block east. Plenty of good restaurants a block or two away as well as the upscale George attached.\\n\\nLovely subterranean swimming pool and hot tub. And a spa",
            "We live in Toronto and were celebrating- my birthday, my husbands birthday and my best friend's and her husband's birthday all fall within a month of each other, so we decided this year to celebrate in style- a night at the Ivy. We kicked things off first at the Sweetgrass spa (for women only) then enjoyed a 10 course tasting menu on George's beautiful courtyard patio.\\n \\nGoing with another couple allowed me to gawk at their room too (room #1). I love how this hotel has only four rooms and all are tasteful and elegant, and so different. Our room (#3) was a glamorous blend of modern mixed with classic timeless materials, a nod to their chocolate factory past. Gorgeous blue wallpaper is charming against the relic brick of a bygone era. The rooms themselves are massive, much roomier than any other downtown hotel I've seen. With different seating areas to recline and relax, including a sunny deck that faces George's patio, my husband and I loved every minute of our stay. The bathroom has a super deep soaker tub and inviting aromatic bath salts- they have clearly anticipated your every thought! \\nOne feature I loved was the Samsung tablet that you use to control the television, but also acts as a portable TV, which they have linked to Netflix...cue the Orange is the New Black marathon! \\n\\nMy bestie's room was an intimate portrait of a Parisian hotel, soft pink striped wallpaper was welcoming and warm. Her room was every bit as luxurious as mine, every detail carefully constructed. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back, absolutely adore the staff, spa and restaurant here. It's a rare gem in a city full of over-done, over hyped hotels (IMHO). Nice gestures like the honour bar and delicious complimentary breakfast are just the finishing touches to a spoiled brat weekend. Thanks Ivy",
            "We stayed at the Ivy for the weekend of our wedding. I had a few services at the Sweetgrass Spa and We had an amazing dinner at George the night before and then prep rooms and photos on the grounds on the day of. The rooms are stunning and the staff was spectacular and helped make the weekend everything one could hope for! We'll definitely be coming back on anniversaries to come",
            "A Gem in a perfect location. Where do I begin. I was greeted by a super nice and friendly staff. I was early for an appointment but interested in my wedding possibly there. I met with planner immediately who was a sweetheart. Just for any thinking about a wedding there, the prices can't be beat!  When I returned I was taken up to my room. The hotel is so lush, with velvet, satin,art work, a library and lounge. One of my favourite features is the honour bar which has inexpensive drinks, free pop, and a espresso coffee machine and tea. The best part was it was right out my bedroom door. The continental breakfast was just the right amount and delicious. The room was just WOW!  It was huge and the wonderful scent from the bath crystals was light yet a delight to the senses. The fixtures were unusual and very artsy. The bathroom was huge! Everything was soft and plush from towels, bedding and bath robes. I only had the pleasure of one night so not enough time to explore all the hotel and neighborhood had to offer. The menu was on a tablet, unlike some hotels where they are a bit used and messy. If you needed something, a friendly staff member was there quickly. I really can't say enough about this wonderful hotel and staff!  Thank you for an amazing night",

So beautiful and stylish but with plenty of substance. The people are warm and helpful and the beds are Hastens so the best sleep ever acheived. There is a Verity spa (complete with hot tub, steam room, and sauna ) on property called Sweetgrass that is exclusive for women but men staying in the hotel can have treatments in their hotel room.

            "Amazing getaway in the heart of Toronto.  Great location, only four rooms in the entire hotel, gorgeous boardrooms, library, balconies.  The hotel rooms are enormous, luxurious, romantic and spotless.  The spa downstairs is just for women (which was kind of wonderful) but the male half of a couple might feel a little left out.  Then he should remind himself that he gets paid more than his wife does to do the same job\\u2026 and go relax in the giant bathtub instead",
            "To start off, the reception greeted me with smiles and hospitality.  The room was extremely clean and set up with bath salts and nice music.  The bed was like drifting on a soft cloud.  The decor and art were stunning and well thought out.  I felt at home and much relaxed in this hotel and didn't want to leave.  Especially after an amazing massage done right in the convenience of my room.  The staff was extremely accommodating and allowed me a late check out, so I could soak in the tub with some lavender bath salts (tub big enough for two).  mmmm...\\n\\nI would return to this hotel at any opportunity I may have",
            "This hotel is part of a small, elegant upscale spa and restaurant complex and women's club. The restaurant is superior as are the spa facilities and the rooms.  Decoration is in impeccable taste in every part of the complex.  The beds are British--Hypnos is the brand.  They are ultra-luxury in price; more importantly, they make for an exceptional sleep. We had a perfect escape to an elegant oasis in the middle of Toronto in the winter.  Highly recommended",
            "This boutique hotel is exactly that. Small, but beautifully put together. Staff were all fantastic. Rooms perfect. Best bathrooms we've found in Canada, and when the weather allows a lovely veranda to sit on. Attached is a ladies health club and spa, and if I lived in Toronto I would join. Can you start one in England  - preferably near where I live \\uD83D\\uDE04 Husband and I had a champagne breakfast to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was lovely",
            "Stayed in room #4 for one night. Concierge was so accommodating- helped with parking and showing us all the ammenities. \\nThe room was spacious and beautiful. Large patio. Complimentary bath salt bar over the spa tub, separate stand up shower and toilet rooms. \\nThe hotel also had a bar for guests in a small sitting area outside the room. It worked based on the honesty system- each drink you had you recorded and were charged 6$\\u002Falcoholic beverage at the end of your stay. They had wine, beer, and all sorts of hard liquor + mix. \\nThere was a complimentary continental breakfast waiting on a table outside your room starting at 715- and when you were ready you called the concierge to bring a pot of fresh coffee. \\nOverall lovely, romantic spot. We also purchased the 4 course tasting menu at George which was amazing. Will return!",
            "My husband had an in- room massage, I relaxed in the spa, before our wonderful dinner at George. Back in our luxurious room, later that evening, we enjoyed a brandy and watched a light snow falling on our terrace.  A magical birthday getaway. Can't wait to go back",
            "This is a hotel within a women-only club, so only females have access to the pool, spa and gym.  The rooms are great, and service is excellent, so I didn't mind staying in the room or walking in the neighborhood while my wife enjoyed the facilitie",

            "Attended a work related conference at Hotel X.  Room was spacious, well appointed with amenities, very clean and had two very comfortable queen beds. My adult also travelled with me to the hotel, and when asked they were more than accommodating with a later check out for him and they also have a excellent departure lounge which made his wait for me to finish at 5:00 pm much more pleasent.  The hotel is very accessible by car and you have the choice of either valet or self parking which is not always available at a hotel of this level in Toronto.  Overall I highly recommend Hotel X and would definitely choose to stay here on my next trip to Toronto",
            "We recently visited this establishment. I travelled with 10 of my close friends. We are all between the ages of 40 and 50 and we\\u2019re all very disappointed with the accommodations. We purposely booked the weekend at this hotel for our bachelorette party because of the amenities that they offered first off our experience was to be started at the rooftop restaurant, which, of course was no fault to the restaurant got cancelled because of the rain, however They had no accommodations for us alternatively, in the hotel therefore we had no dinner reservations. We had to go to roses social, which was OK but the menu is just for pub food basically And of course it was too late to get any reservation at a nice restaurant in Toronto so even though they had interior seating for Valerie, they did not accommodate us because they were overbooked\\nThe hotel was extremely packed way too many people and therefore even to get some lunch, it was impossible. The caf\\u00E9 was closed at 3:00 PM and we ordered room service, which was our only choice since everything else was packed and it took over an hour and a half to get any type of food., Service Food was good once we actually received it\\nFollowing our dinner was supposed to be entertainment on level 27 as well as the lobby bar, which is a public bar that they normally have open to which were closed due to the 27th floor for personal party and the lobby bar is completely closed when they knew they had a full Capacity hotel that was further from the downtown region. I called to discuss charges on my card as well as my disappointment and of course no return call. No one seem to know or care about anything there Other than the one bartender at the pool bar Who completely resonated with us. \\nI would never return to this establishment. It was a complete disappointment",
            "This is such a beautiful hotel and the perfect location to stay at it you are attending an event at Budweiser Garden.  The convenience can't be beat.  Imagine being back at your room ten minutes after the event ends?  Having stayed in downtown Toronto many times, this is my all time favourite Toronto Hotel.   I love staying near the water and the lakefront trails can't be beat.  Easily within a half hour walking distance to many neat restaurants and activities along the shore.  The hotel itself is very luxurious and the staff could not be nicer or more accommodating.  The rooftop pool is fantastic as is the hotel fitness centre!  Have been back many times and will return again",
            "Honestly I had high hopes for Hotel X. From the outside looking in, 5 stars seems fitting. As a first time guest, i\\u2019ll tell you why I wouldn\\u2019t bother to stay here again. The actual rooms in the hotel favor a Marriott. No personality or character.  Food was a headache because there\\u2019s one restaurant with a mediocre selection and a cafe that closes whenever it wants. There was so many events happening during my stay it just felt like one big party from my room and i didn\\u2019t enjoy that. The staff was nice though. The gym isn\\u2019t the hotels gym but you can still use it and it\\u2019s designed to satisfy tennis players. You have to rent racquets if you wanna play on the court which is an additional charge. All the amenities from the theatre, to golf is going to cost you and is not included with what you paid. I\\u2019ve stayed in many hotels in toronto , this might not even crack my top 10.",
            "Beautiful modern Hotel with exceptional friendly service.\\n\\nWonderful lake views, loved the art gallery. \\nGreat place for couples, family and business travel. Exceptional amenities, curtesy drop off to our dinner venue was a great plus.\\nBuffet breakfast was the icing on the cake, one of the best we've had at any hotel. \\n\\nThank you Hotel X Toronto, we look forward to our next stay",
            "We stayed here in 2019 and loved it (I think we gave it 5 stars). The hotel is still awesome, but our 2022 5 night stay was not as good as it should have been with the awful service at the restaurants and bars. In particular the rooftop bar and the poolside restaurants were terrible. Menus were different than posted in their website (the gluten free options were gone), the inside and outside were different menus even though they used the same bar. Drinks at pool took forever. Servers seemed annoyed they had to find pens to charge to the room. On and on. The F&B management should be fired",
            "Absolutely fantastic hotel that, although pricey, provides an overall experience that justifies the extra expense.  This hotel has the most spectactlar athletic facilities we have ever seen in a hotel and the rooftop pool is wonderful (thoughfully designed with a partition that allows both indoor and outdoor use during winter).  Breakfast (not included in the room rate) at Roses Cafe was very good and reasonably priced for the quality.  The nearest streetcar station (509 & 511) is a 5 minute walk and the location is great for events at the Coca-Cola Coliseum and Convention Centre.  Staff were responsive and helpful.  We will definitely stay here again when back in Toronto",
            "A family of 3, we stayed here both in 2018 and 2019 and so were very much looking forward to doing so again now the pandemic has allowed international travel. Once again it has been an outstanding experience. The staff are all courteous and helpful, the room is always spotlessly clean and well presented and the location across the way from Lake Ontario and the Budweiser Stage is wonderful. The facilities are incredible from a roof top pool to tennis courts, table tennis, basketball and even it's own cinema. On our next visit to Toronto from the UK, there is nowhere else we'll be staying. A special mention to MD Fariyal Hasham for his assistance before, during and after our stay",
            "My boyfriend and I stayed at Hotel X at the end of August for a few nights for a fun getaway.  We live in downtown Toronto...but instead of heading out of the city we decided to stay here for a different experience and this place was exactly what we hoped it would be!  \\nUpon check-in we were greeted by the loveliest staff members who truly went above and beyond to ensure we had the perfect room.  They also helped us secure an early check-in (which is never guaranteed) as we were going to the spa first thing that morning and we were so grateful!  After the spa we visited the rooftop pool which was FABULOUS!!  At first we were disappointed to learn that you had to book certain times to be there but after we got there we really appreciated it because it keeps the pool less crowded and much more relaxing. The pool is just beautiful and was definitely one of our favourite parts of the stay! \\nWe also must talk abut Roses Cocina!!  The food here was next level and so unexpected as we haven't heard of the restaurant before staying there!  Everything we tried on the menu was delicious for brunch, lunch and dinner! I personally ate the Huevos Rancheros every day and I still talk about how great it was!  Roses is definitely a place we will be back to enjoy dinner again even if we aren't at the hotel!\\nThe movie theatre was a very fun extra to the property and we also enjoyed how close Hotel X was to The Ex and also Budweiser Stage. If you are seeing a concert there it is a GREAT idea to stay at the hotel to enhance your experience for sure!\\nLastly, we must talk about the service!  I had read some reviews before booking that were mixed but I am delighted to tell you that our experience was absolutely wonderful with all the staff we came in contact with!  Sebastien at the front desk, and both Concierges we spoke with before we arrived were extremely helpful!  Special mention to Jacob Felts as he truly went above and beyond for us to make sure our stay was excellent.  He checked in with us each day and offered his kind assistance wherever he could and made sure we were always happy, he even went way above our expectations and helped us have dinner at Roses Cocina our last night even though it was fully booked!  He really understands impeccable service and he is an asset to the team there.  \\nWe will be back! Thank you all so much",
            "I wanted to do something special for my husband's birthday this year and when I passed by this hotel on my way home from a meeting one day, it immediately captured my eye and thought that this hotel and location was perfect to surprise my husband on a mini getaway for his birthday in the city. I made reservations 2 days before we checked in and because I wanted to make my husbands surprise birthday extra special, I decided to upgrade our room. I quickly called the hotel to make the arrangements and they made the changes with no problem. On the day of our check-in I decided last minute that I wanted to include balloons and a small dessert prior to checking in. When I spoke to the concierge, she said that they required up to 24hrs notice to have the balloons set up in which I understood and accepted that it was okay. Once we arrived, the hotel was beautiful! We were greeted by smiling faces and the reception staff were so nice. They even gave our son a little stuffed animal as a welcome gift. When we got to our room and I opened the door, to my surprise there were balloons and a small pastry that read \\\"Happy Birthday\\\". They gave us a stunning view of the city which added the extra surprise! Everything in the room was spotless and so clean. They were even so thoughtful to include some bath essentials for my son and had laid them so nicely in the crib. A few minutes after settling into the hotel room, we heard a knock on the door. When we opened it, my husband received a special delivery of a bucket of beer. At this moment, we were beyond grateful for the amazing treatment we received from this hotel. We have never been treated with upmost tremendous service. Everything about this hotel was spectacular - from the staff, to the decor, the room and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, and just overall experience. This hotel lives up to it's standards and beyond. I couldn't have been more pleased that I chose Hotel X to surprise my husband with on his birthday. This is one of our top hotels thus far. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you Hotel X for your wonderful service!",
            "We had the best time :) The hotel and amenities are amazing. Everyone who works at the hotel is friendly and professional. Two random things: the shower has tremendous water pressure!!! and the ventilation system in the room is completely silent, for those who hate that type of noise. We would definitely stay again",
            "Hubby treated me to a night here for my birthday after the Toronto FC game, lovely hotel, super friendly check in staff. Got a surprise in the room for my birthday.

We went in the rooftop pool in the evening, was amazing and warm, really enjoyed it despite it being minus 5 \\uD83D\\uDE01 Would definitely go back for a quick mini break in the city, had great vies of the CN tower and islands. Breakfast was great, we ordered room service and it arrived hot and fresh. Room was great, clean, spacious with everything we needed",
            "This hotel is not only sleek and modern but a perfect place to stay when attending a concert at Bud Stage.  A quick walk over saves so much stress in having to find parking and waiting in traffic.  Had a delicious meal at ROSES Cocina and room service breakfast was amazing as well.  Staff was professional and friendly including the valet staff who did their best to try and keep us dry during a rain storm.  Only real improvement note I would make was when at the pool we didn't see anyone coming around to take drink orders.  We had to go in and order and pick up drinks ourselves.  Not sure if poolside drink service is usually available but may be a missed opportunity for those wanting to enjoy a drink or two while at the pool.  We had two teenagers as well with us who really enjoyed everything about the stay and have already asked to go again!  Thank you for a great night",

Our room was exquisite with a corner window on the 26 floors we really enjoyed our comfort.\\n\\nWe would definitively go back for a nice staycation",
            "Hotel X is a dreamy, well designed hotel with excellent amenities. I fell in love with the design and decor of the public spaces of the hotel. My room was large, well appointed and had many great features: robes & slippers, Nespresso machine, automatic black out blind, good lighting, ample plugs and USB ports, an ultra comfortable bed and a nice sunset view. \\n\\nThe 24\\u002F7 fitness centre can\\u2019t be beat. I love that I was able to sign up for a hot yoga class too (additional charge).\\n\\nI liked the lake view. I didn\\u2019t try the restaurants but liked the Nespresso cafe and appreciated the convenience of the attached Starbucks. \\n\\nI stayed at this hotel for work while attending a conference at the beanfield centre so the location was unbeatable. I would definitely stay in this hotel again, especially if I don\\u2019t have a need to be right downtown. It\\u2019s worth nothing it\\u2019s a close walk to the island airport (and they have a free shuttle) for added convenience",
            "I really enjoy every stay I have at Hotel X, it is definitely my go-to place for staycations in Toronto because the property literally has everything you could ever ask for!  The rooftop pool is by far my favourite as it's never over-crowded (due to having reserved times) & the pool side drink service is always a lovely extra (shout out to Quincey who is so friendly and great!)  This stay we really enjoyed spending time in our room; which was impeccably clean and had a lovely view.  A special mention to Armhie from housekeeping who made us feel so incredibly special during our stay, she really went above and beyond and exceeded our expectations!  The front desk staff was so lovely and welcoming (Parnav was great!) and we really enjoyed Roses Social for brunch- special mentions to Starr and Harshit for their excellent customer service!  If you haven't tried the huevos rancheros dish at Roses you need to, it's the best! We will be back, thank you Hotel X",
            "To say that I knew I picked the right place from the moment we walked in would be an understatement, because I knew well ahead of time that we were in great hands from just the email correspondence I had with the Hotel X team to prepare for the occasion. \\n\\nFor context, I had booked the hotel for my partner and I to retire to after celebrating a relationship milestone in downtown Toronto. I wanted to show as romantic a gesture as I could to cap off the night and made several specific requests about the room and its overall presentation to have a totally personalized experience. They understood the mission and executed in a manner that exceeded any expectation I had. \\n\\nOn its own, the hotel is already something like a paradise on earth. It has that high-end, luxurious atmosphere the moment you walk in - it is beautiful in every sense of the word and would impress anyone who chose to stay. \\n\\nThat said, what's really prompting this review is that level of care that their team handled my requests with. The team managing reservations promptly answered all my questions and were proactive in their communications. The concierge team and anyone else involved in finding me a room that met my requirements and decorating it as I envisioned delivered in an enormous way. It felt like I had very motivated friends handle the task for me with the level of precision in their output.\\n\\nEverything was perfect, and I couldn't be happier with my stay. Beautiful room, impressive building, and exceptional service",
            "Stayed at this hotel in summer 2019.  Excellent service and amenities.  Location is also great for access to the Enercare Centre. Only recommendation is that guests be able to access the squash club during their stay",
            "Thanks to the great staff and accommodations at Hotel X my family enjoyed an amazing two-day winter break stay in Toronto. My teenage boys enjoyed the part-indoor, part-outdoor infinity pool on the 28th floor, even though it was January. The Aurora Winter Festival along the lake was amazing and a short walk from the hotel. The hotel was kind enough to provide comp tickets. We also received free tix to the Second City Improv performance at one of the two theaters in the hotel, which the entire family enjoyed. One of the my boys loves books and thoroughly enjoyed the library at the property. My boys also enjoyed the attached sports facility where we played basketball and ping pong and fitness center for free. Because we were celebrating my wife's birthday, the staff was also kind enough to surprise her with a special treat in our hotel room. We totally recommend adding the Library Club Lounge to your experience. The breakfast and happy hour and attentive staff are totally worth the extra expense. My wife also enjoyed her time at the onsite spa, where again the staff and treatment could not have been better. Hotel X was truly the highlight of our Toronto experience",
            "We had the greatest experience at Hotel X for one night Sept 1st. We stayed in room 1103 (corner suite) was beautiful. The room delivers amazing views of Lake Ontario, Porter Airport, Yacht club, Ontario place and the CNE.  We were lucky to enjoy the jets practicing for the air show & had a great night sleep.  With the window shut it was not noisy at all with the exhibition happening.\\nThe roof top pool views were just as beautiful while enjoying a few drinks.  We had lunch at Roses on the 2nd floor. I have shellfish & egg allergies so brioche buns are not good for me, the server was quick to assure me there would be no issues at all. I enjoyed a tasty burger on grilled sourdough rye, the staff where extremely accommodating and very friendly.   I will surely stay again",
            "If you are considering a stay in a \\u201Cluxury\\u201D hotel in Toronto avoid Hotel X. I stayed here with a few friends in their junior suite and had the most horrible experience. The service doesn\\u2019t match the exorbitant cost of the room. The taps in all the bathrooms were boiling hot leaving it impossible for us to wash our faces at night, when we called the front desk (after countless attempts someone finally answered) the resolution was to \\u201Clet it run for 5 minutes\\u201D. For a place that seems to be \\u201C5-star\\u201D I would expect that all rooms have decent hot\\u002Fcold water options. They never answered the phone in a timely manner when we had requests. We were also scheduled at the Guerlain Spa the next day and requested the room to be kept until our appointment was over so we could return and change, they refused to accommodate this request even though it was only until 1:30pm leaving them plenty of time to clean the room for the next check in (3:00pm). It would have been the least they could do given the mishap in the room to begin with. For a junior suite I was incredibly underwhelmed, the lights were confusing and dim in one of the bathrooms and overall there was nothing spectacular to justify the cost of staying here. Only positive remarks I have are for the view from the room and the beautiful spa. I\\u2019ve had much better customer service at significantly cheaper\\u002F lower star hotels. Just don\\u2019t expect much besides the architecture and views from this place. Overhyped and overpriced",
            "We have travelled al around the world and we have visited many hotels, but this hotel exceeds all expectations! We are spoiled now for the rest of our lives! On my 50th birthday celebration the hotel surprised me  with a cheesecake at breakfast and champagne and chocolate strawberries when we came back in the hotel. Also a free dessert with candle in Maxx kitchen. Then on christmasday we were served a tray with christmas cookies. We loved the swimming pool, with warm water and swimming outside on the rooftop, overlooking Toronto. We loved our stay so much that we decided to cancel our other hotel that we had booked for the end of our vacation and booked again in the same room. When we came back we had a warm welcome in the lobby, thanx to Lawrence. In the room was a card and a fruitbasket. To top it all we got complimentary tickets to the aurora winterfestival. We booked the club room, and had lovely breakfast and wine and dine each day. The staff in the clubroom was very nice, especially Jack, loved talking with you. Thanx hotel X for a wonderfull stay!",
            "We arrived at the hotel and it is beautiful the view is very nice! The problems begin with the fact that they are advertised as a luxury hotel while the wait staff is beyond stuck up! When you are paying 600$ a night for a room you would except to get some level of care from the staff! We tipped at least 20 percent for everything! There is no coffee in the rooms if you want coffee you have to pay 10.50 for a pot and of course tip room service. There is no ice machines if you want ice you have to call room service and wait for them to bring it to you in a tiny bucket and also tip of course. A wrap with deli lunch meat turkey and fries was 40$ from room service! The indoor outdoor pool was not warm enough and the inside part was super small there was also no hot tub. Overall it was a very disappointing experience",
            "I booked a night for my son and I to stay and enjoy the pool and amenities through Expedia, and due to covid they require that you book a reservation for the pool. I called countless times with no answer ahead of time, and emailed multiple times over a few weeks prior to our visit. Finally the day before we arrive they wrote to say because we booked on Expedia, we weren't allowed to reserve ahead of time, only those who book directly at the hotel.\\nConsequently, when we arrived we could only go to the pool after 5 pm.\\nTheir rooftop lounge took 25 mins for a drink and both food orders were wrong. \\nWe went to have a drink in the lobby before dinner and we're told that drinks would be 20 mins. \\nI actually stayed here before and the service was Fantastic, not sure what happened to this place- which is unfortunate as I live in the area and would have frequented the place for corporate events",
            "We stayed in a Corner King Studio with our dog and it was incredible! Check-in process was so smooth and felt very welcomed and fully informed about everything we could expect. Their preparedness to make our stay special was incredible too - with dog bowls and a dog bed ready for us in our clean and spacious room. Beautiful views of the lake. Clean and spacious room with the comfiest bed ever. Room service was served on the dot of the requested time - everything was perfect. We couldn't check out all of the amenities, but the rooftop pool was amazing. For dog owners, not only are the hotel courtyard spaces great to walk through, but the nearby parks are only a quick walk away and the area is very clean and safe to walk around! Thank you for the incredible stay",
            "This review is a little late in coming, but as they say, better late than never.... Hotel X... where do I start. Grandeur in size, exuberant in style and excellence in customer service.   My husband and I were there for our anniversary in December of 2019.   We loved the facility, there is so much to do.   It was everything we wanted and more for our anniversary.  A special thanks  to Director of Sales, Saira.  Her passion shines through, each time she talks about what the hotel has to offer.  If it wasn't for her we would not have enjoyed the hotel as much as we did.  Saira, is passionate about this facility and presents this to clients with great pride.  This library hotel is equipped with books everywhere, borrow a book from anywhere  in the hotel, take it to your room or the pool side and  enjoy it.  The hotel has a theatre, an art gallery, an all season outdoor pool, state of the art tennis court and gym...  The resturants and the VIP lounge offers great good selections. \\nIf you are visiting as a family, there is tons to do for the kids.  \\nWe loved our stay so much that we will be returning with our family soon. \\nOnce again thank you Saira for making our stay so memorable. Looking forward to coming back soon.",
            "We stayed for two nights over the Easter long weekend and had a fabulous time. Very friendly staff. The concierge Steve stood out in particular - he is a true professional who paid special attention to ensure our kids had a great time! \\n\\nIt\\u2019s a beautiful modern hotel. We especially enjoyed the heated rooftop pool, spacious movie room with popcorn and drinks, access to the gym\\u002Ftennis\\u002Fracquetball, ping pong and basketball, and the kids play centre (small fee) that had sports, electronics, and arts. The concierge planned an Easter egg hunt for the kids which was a big hit! \\n\\nBreakfast was delicious! Next time we\\u2019ll take advantage of the Guerlain spa. I bought some perfumes which are exclusive and hard to find. The only downside was that the lounge was closed and the skybar is under renovations. It would have been nice to experience those amenities. But we had a fabulous time nonetheless and will be back",
            "This is a phenomenal hotel and my preferred hotel whenever I visit Toronto. The second you walk in, you are greeted by a very clean signature scent and a breathtaking live wall. The service at the front desk is unmatched. The rooms are large, clean, modern and super comfortable. There are multiple restaurants available in house, which is very helpful in Toronto winters where you might not want to venture outside. The additional amenities (pool, golf, racquetball, Pilates studio and more) allow for team building activities and self care options when staying. Overall an amazing property.",
            "I will have to say, my stay was  very frustrating. It was my anniversary and the hotel did nothing to celebrate it. Literally nothing, zero hospitality.\\n1) at the SPA they mixed up my couples massage and took us separate. We ended up getting into one room and they did give us free samples after due to the mix up\\n2) The front desk says you can only book a 2 hour time slot for the rooftop pool. So we go an I see other couples granted back to back time slots and when I asked the worker at the pool, they said front desk granted it. This is my anniversary, are others \\\"buying\\\" their time? They wouldnt even let us sit in a complete empty seating area. In addition, it took 35 mins and going to a waiter 3 times for us to order food. The waiters were not interested, very slow.\\n3) Then my wife and I figure, lets go the Valerie to get a quick bite to eat, they say we are not allowed because brunch is over. Yet its all completely empty and we could even sit!\\n4) We go to the ROSA COCINA resturant and again, they recognize its our anniversary and dont bring ANYTHING to recognize our day.\\n\\nI told front desk about this and they did nothing and jus said sorry. TO be honest, this is a very nice hotel with lots to do. But I will say, it is by far the worst service Ive ever had anywhere I have ever gone. And they could care less about it being my anniversary.\\n\\nHonestly, dont go and save your money",
            "I just can't say enough good things about Hotel X Toronto. From the moment we arrived on Friday to the moment we left, it was a five star experience! \\n\\nI have been here a few times before and it has always been fabulous but with the staff shortages caused by Covid, I was ready to manage my expectations. (We went on a family vacation out west this year and ran into this everywhere - regardless of the type of hotel chain, high-end and not). Hotel X Toronto is an example of how it's done! \\n\\nWow, wow, wow! The most beautiful rooms (we splurged on a two bedroom suite for a girlfriend's birthday weekend); the great food and service at the X Lounge, the responsive and amazing front desk staff\\u002Froom service, etc. Our entire party also went to the Guerlain spa where every one of us had the best facial\\u002Fmassage we have every had. The gym in the hotel is also one of the nicest in the city! We only use the main equipment but there are all kinds of classes available too.\\n\\nThis hotel has a resort feel and is a tru oasis with killer views and an incredible rooftop pool. I am already planning my next stay",
            "Paid over $500 for a one night stay and while the rooms were comfortable, had nice views and some of the staff we encountered we're friendly that's about where the good stops. The main reason a lot of people (including ourselves) book this hotel is because of the rooftop pool that floods all of their advertisements however what they fail to mention is that you only get one 2 hour time slot per stay to use the pool and you can't even pick your own hours you have to go with the times they offer, we were offered a 9a.m- 11a.m timeslot and when we were offered this it was already 10:15 a.m leaving us only 45 minutes to enjoy the pool, there is also no way to pre book your pool time before check in to prepare for this rule and no you are not allowed to stay and use it after check out either if you didn't get a chance during your stay.  We have stayed at many hotels in the city both luxury and budget friendly and have never had to book a pool slot (outside of covid) and not been allowed to stay and enjoy hotel amenities after check out. It's very clear that all this hotel cares about is taking as much money from their guests as possible without actually wanting to provide the service that should come with the steep price tag. If you're looking for a hotel in Toronto with a luxury feel who also have pools with amazing views and actually care about their guests I'd recommend the Sheraton Center or Fairmount",
            "Managed to sneak away with the hubby for a weekend at the end of last summer and had such an amazing time.  The views, staff and facilities were fantastic!  Was a little skeptical given the situation but felt immediately at ease from the moment we got there.  Staff was very attentive, and I really liked the added touch of being able to communicate everything through text message.  I needed extra towels and a facecloth and just texted.  So convenient!  Discovered later that they had tennis courts?  Wow, wish I knew beforehand so I could have brought the right shoes!\\n\\nNow I know and will definitely be back once this COVID stuff is done",
            "Do not stay here if you expect any service as a hotel guest. So unwelcoming and absolutely not worth the steep price. I\\u2019m from Toronto and paid for a one bedroom suite which cost just over $1000 for a bachelorette. Might as well have stayed at home.  I called room service to order 2 martinis and the lady on the other line said \\u201Cwe don\\u2019t do that\\u201D. When asked what that means she said they don\\u2019t provide alcohol, which is fine but she didn\\u2019t tell me what my options were since there was no in-room bar fridge. When pressed she stated that they only have \\u201Ccanned alcohol\\u201D and if I want a martini I should call the front desk and they can get one from one of the restaurants. Long story short, after about a dozen unanswered calls to front desk and guest services I was told they can\\u2019t help me and my best bet was to try to go to the restaurant myself and get the drinks. To be clear, they weren\\u2019t actually sure this would work. I also highly doubt the restaurant would allow me to walk around the hotel with 2 martinis\\u2026 \\n\\nI also booked the hotel solely for the pool which we basically couldn\\u2019t use. My checkout was at 12 but apparently I could only book the pool from 9-11 EVEN THOUGH checkout was at 12. They don\\u2019t stipulate this when you book the hotel unless it\\u2019s in MICRO print somewhere I didn\\u2019t see. We got there around 9:30 am and there were no lounge chairs. We had to sit on hard, uncomfortable patio chairs and were forced to leave at 11 am. \\n\\nDo not stay here and use you hard-earned money to go to a hotel that services their guests. \\",
            "My stay here was so amazing! It was a great staycation. The COVID protocol is on point. All the staff wear their masks correctly, self cleaning elevator buttons, sanitizer everywhere, pool bookings are 2 hours so you always get time at the pool, the lounge chairs are spaced out as well as seating in the restaurants.\\n\\nThe staff were all so nice. We got a sweets tray upon welcome, early check in, late check out, extra pool bookings, free parking, breakfast for two, room upgrade. I recommend booking the bed and breakfast package - it's worth it!\\n\\nNo complaints at all. Great job Hotel X and thank you!",
            "Hotel was lovely, rooms were clean, was a beautiful space, but very disappointed in guest experience.\\n\\nFelt as though we were unable to use most of the in-house complimentary amenities from the concierge car service to pool. Almost everything was booked up by the time we checked-in for our one night stay and the hotel was chosen specifically for what it offered. We were able to use the screening room which was great, but the room was clearly not cleaned before our reserved time as there was other guests trash throughout the space\\u002F all over the floor.\\n\\nGlad they\\u2019re investing in a second pool because for what was able to be reserved (an outdoor dining chair for 1 hour as other guests had thrown their towels on pool loungers when they were not needed) is not a relaxing or luxury hotel experience.\\n\\nPlease do better for your guests who are not there for\\u002F apart of weddings",
            "We arrived an hour and a half before check in as you need a reservation for the pool and we were hoping for some outside pool time before a concert.  We were told we could go at 7pm or 7am the next day.  Value for dollar I\\u2019ve had better rooms and better and consistent access to outdoor space at radisson blu down the road.  I\\u2019m disappointed for the price paid, I am essentially having to stay in my room.  Will not be staying here again, while the location is convenient to Budweiser Stage, not being able to use the only amenity I booked the hotel for (outdoor pool) has put a sour taste in my mouth.  If outdoor pool access is what you want, then save your money and book elsewhere",
            "One of the most comfortable and exquisite hotels I have ever stayed in. The  Hospitality service upon check-in was excellent.  Nick made sure everything went smoothly and explained all that the hotel had to offer.  We were able to enjoy the roof-top pool, an amazing state of the art fitness facility, and a very comfortable room with a sunset view.  \\nWe ate dinner at Roses Cocina where the food was good, but the servers seemed to have needed a little more help.  It could have been just a busy night, but hopefully the next time we visit, this restaurant will have worked that out.\\nRoom service for breakfast came right on time and the food was delicious!\\nWe have since booked two more stays, with very special thanks to Edwin in reservations and Stephen, the Concierge",
            "There are truly no words for this hotel . From the moment you arrive to that lobby and scent the views of Toronto are spectacular and the pool only adds to that! The rooms are so well executed with all you need and the full glass windows are OMG! The beds and linen are divine , you truly don\\u2019t want to leave. We ate two meals ( dinner and brunch ) at Roses and both were exceptional ! Service couldn\\u2019t be better . We felt as if we were so special for our entire visit ! If you feel like a magical weekend away, RUN don\\u2019t walk to Hotel X",
            "Our check and check out were seamless.  The staff is unbelievable and so pleasant. It took a couple tries to get through to room service. I heard that from a few people.  The lights are bit complicated but once you figure them out no problem.  We were escorted to our room with our bags but the bellman did not go over the room ammenities and how the lights worked.  The rooms were well laid out but some of the furniture was showing its age. The beds were comfortable.  The hotel is beautiful has great views and tons to offer from gym facilities to tennis courts and a spa.  The location is not really accessible for walking or sightseeing you definitely need a car or ride share.  I am rating this hotel based on the staff and amenities. I think the rooms are completely over priced for what you get. You could stay and many other high end hotels for the same money that offer more in terms of locations and luxury.",
            "My fiancee and I booked Hotel X as soon as lockdown was being lifted and it was the best decision we could have made. As someone who travels to countless of resorts for business - Hotel X truly reminded me of a destination resort. It was such an amazing escape from the day to day. The food, service and amenities are incomparable to other hotels in the city. Yuna & Matt went out of their way to make sure our stay was nothing less than perfect. We booked the pool with ease and had a great time at the rooftop pool. We had dinner at The Grill (you have to try to the flatbread!). It was such a great way to feel some normalcy during the pandemic and Hotel X made sure we felt safe and everything was always cleaned and sanitized. Our room had an incredible view and the comfiest bed. We can't wait to return next month -this is definitely now our go to staycation spot",
            "I basically chose this hotel at such an off-centre location because it had a full gym with fitness centre, yoga classes, steam room and even tennis courts! However, surprise, surprise, steam room is only accessible to gym members. And, not surprisingly, yoga classes cost 25$ each and 47$ for the tennis courts. In the end, I simply used the fitness centre without being able to relax after my activities in the steam room. \\nThere are also steam rooms at the adjacent Guerlain spa but at the hefty price of 280$ for a 90-minute massage that is not even done by a regular massage therapist, so they won\\u2019t be giving receipts. Won\\u2019t be coming back. It is just not worthwhile",
            "Stayed here for two nights in a suite for a wedding (October 14-16). The views are unparalleled and the room was well equipped and classically decorated \\u002F furnished. Not super modern or chic, but tastefully done.\\n\\nThe staff were extremely accommodating and offered us complimentary parking, late check-out, chocolate-covered strawberries and hastily catered to multiple requests without any issue whatsoever. Top grades all around.\\n\\nWe didn\\u2019t have an opportunity to take advantage of the many amenities the property has to offer, and didn\\u2019t eat at the restaurants either. That being said, we did order room service for breakfast, and although a few more options would have been nice, what we did order off the menu was done to perfection",
            "Words cannot describe my stay at this downtown luxury. Me and my wife stayed overnight to give us a retreat from the city while we are currently under the \\\"grey\\\" zone\\n\\nThe view was spectacular and the breakfast was the best I ever had from any Hotels I have visited.  \\n\\nThe Guerlain Spa was def worth the price, shouts out to Julie! \\n\\nThanks Hotel X, especially Steven and Carlos for their warm and friendly manners during our stay \\n\\nWill visit again the future",
            "Stayed here with our young kids for a staycation. Room (superior queen) was the perfect size and the view of the water and airport made the kids super happy. The in room amenities for the kids such as milk and desserts, balloons, stuffies and colouring pages were above and beyond to make their stay extra special. The kids play centre was great, well equipped with toys and video games, and the staff was very caring and attentive to the kids. The entire property was beautifully kept and well equipped with the pool, virtual golf, gym, etc. we didn\\u2019t use the gym much but it was probably one of the more impressive facilities I\\u2019ve seen anywhere. The pool was small (the indoor part; outdoor is much bigger) but the water was warm and we still enjoyed it. Service at the restaurant onsite was excellent, but I will note that it\\u2019s your only food option so there\\u2019s not a lot of variety. However, you can always order delivery so not a big deal. The concierges were always kind and helpful, and I will note that the manager Pranav went out of his way to help us book the room according to our needs, and ensure we had a good stay. The retro arcade room was really well done as well, we enjoyed using that. The rooms are very clean and everything is very up to date, I even noted the elevator buttons were self sanitizing! It\\u2019s 5 stars in terms of most aspects, not quite like the Ritz Carlton or ShangriLa, but this property was way more fun than those places and much better value. We would definitely stay again, and that\\u2019s really what matters",
            "We had the most incredible girls weekend at Hotel X!  From the moment we checked in, we felt like royalty.  We stayed in the a corner suite with the most amazing views from all directions.  The living room style set up was perfect for lounging, relaxing and having a great catch up with friends.\\n\\nOur room had an incredible bathroom with a large soaker tub.  The water pressure in the stand up shower was incredible (always a bonus).  Just off of the washroom was a beautiful little vanity complete with cosmetic mirror and lights.\\n\\nThe concierge Stephen was AMAZING and so helpful in helping us select our restaurant for the evening.  As we were celebrating birthdays he also arranged for a beautiful surprise bottle of Rose to be sent up to our room.\\n\\nAfter a night on the town, we returned to our room and had the most incredible sleep!  Housekeeping had set up our pull out bed and the turndown service was lovely.  I have to say that the beds and bedding at Hotel X are top notch.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning we visited 10XTO, the beautiful luxury athletic club attached to the Hotel.  My girlfriend and I went to a Pilates reformer class with Joanna.  She was an amazing instructor and delivered an awesome class.\\n\\nFollowing our workout, we went to the Sky Bar for Lunch and took in the last moments of the breathtaking view.  We ordered one of each the Asian inspired appetizers (all delicious).\\n\\nIf you are looking for a 5 star experience for your next girls get away, Hotel X is the place to be.  We will absolutely be back!",
            "We had originally booked a room here for our wedding weekend in 2020. After postponing and eventually cancelling the big wedding, we weren't able to get a refund on the room so we used the excuse for a mini honeymoon. The service was excellent, all staff very friendly and responsive. The one bedroom suite was beautiful, with views of both the water and the city skyline. Booking reservations at the pool was efficient, as was reserving a table at the Falcon Sky bar.  We had drinks there on Friday night, great atmosphere, great DJ, only complaint was no drink menu to see a list of cocktails or have any idea of pricing. \\nFor a suite, I thought the bar area could have been a bit better equipped; the mini fridge is extremely small, not many glasses or extra utensils\\u002Fwine tools for entertaining. \\nLighting in the room was excellent, always appreciate dimmer switches! \\nWe tried to book the car service that drops guests off within a 5km radius of the hotel, however  it's not running due to Covid...this seemed a little strange as taxis\\u002FUbers are all operating with easy protocols in place. \\nThe rooftop pool is really nice, great views and limited capacity which means you can't stay for more than two hours but it doesn't get crowded which we appreciated. \\nOnly minor complaint would be that extended checkout is only 30 minutes, which doesn't make much of a difference. \\nOverall we had a great stay, very comfortable, clean and relaxing environment.  \\",
            "Lovely property with very luxorious amneties. Absolutely beautiful view from our room on the 23rd floor.\\n\\nComplimentary soaps from the room had amazing fragrences and really made you feel like you were at a spa",
            "Stayed two nights with a friend in a suite to attend a\\nbachelorette weekend. We specifically picked this\\nhotel to have a relaxing pool day Sunday at the end\\nof the weekend. \\n\\nCome to find out at check in amenities can not be used last check out (noon). Have been to several luxury resorts around the world and this is not consistent with those experiences. Have always been able to use the amenities after check out. Further, you may only book for a two hour window. Fine. They allow us to book the llam-1:00pm window. They inform us only guests on the reservation may use the pool, so we added the bride (who lives in Toronto) to the reservation for the Saturday night so she could join us by the pool Sunday. The hotel charged us $50 for this. We arrive promptly at 1lam for our two hour scheduled visit Sunday and there is not a single lounger for us to use. The bride needs an even tan for her wedding next weekend and had to lay towels on the ground to tan her back. See pictures for the kind of luxury pool experience you can expect at hotel X. How disappointing. Would\\nhave chosen a different hotel had we known all of\\nthe stipulations and complications of using the\\nrooftop pool. Even if you follow all the rules you'll still\\nend up tanning on the ground. There is a plethora of\\nspace up there the hotel should invest in 50 more\\nloungers and get ride of all the chairs",
            "We chose to stay here based on a friend's recommendation, and the service, amenities, food, views, and value were outstanding! We were in a junior suite, which was spacious, came with everything you could possibly need (robe, slippers, umbrella, etc), was absolutely silent on a Saturday\\u002FSunday night, and included access to the Library Lounge. We paid for breakfast at Maxx's on our first morning, and utilized the complimentary breakfast in the lounge on our second day. The staff were terrific, room service was great, all of the bars had great city views, the art gallery on the lower level was gorgeous, and the rooftop pool even has an accessibility chair to lower people into the water. They have truly thought of everything. It was too cold to enjoy the wraparound balcony but we look forward to coming back in better weather",
            "I live in Toronto and selected this hotel to host a group weekend to celebrate an upcoming wedding. \\nI met 7 out-of-town guests on Friday. From the moment we pulled up until we checked out, the staff was authentically courteous. \\nThe hotel exceeded my expectations from the website and online photos. \\nWe used a number of the amenities during our 2 night stay. \\nHot yoga, gym equipment, pool and steam rooms were enjoyed the first day. The pool is partially indoors with access (swim under the glass divider) to the outdoor pool. It is fully heated and we swam outside during the snowstorm!  The indoor pool is very limited for space. Most of the pool space is outdoor.  \\nWe had the package that included 4:30 wine and cheese as well as the continental breakfast. Both services were superb. \\nWith our own curiosity tour, we saw the multiple squash courts, the 10XTO fitness facilities and dined in Maxx's restaurant. All amenities impressed everyone in our group. \\nWe had free self parking and it was very easy and hassle free access to the hotel elevator. \\nEvery employee, no matter what part of the hotel you were in, had a smile and were eager to help however needed. \\nYou can certainly come here and have no reason to leave if you're looking for a getaway to chill and treat yourself. \\nI live 15 min away and plan to book family Staycations in the near future."

We stayed 2 nights for an anniversary and the staff could not have done more to help make our stay a wonderful experience. Unfortunately the affiliated Georges restaurant was shut the evenings we stayed (Sun\\u002FMon) but we were recomended a superb local steak house (Berberians) and the Georges Lunch on Monday was excellent. \\n\\nOverall a really fabulous stay and our only suggestions would be to put some cheap pens or pencils in the room to note down stuff without having to rummage through the executive carrier bags!\\n\\nOverall a rare gem, but we did feel that it needs to communicate a clear proposition; as a fabulous boutique hotel, a fine dining experience, a club,a ladies health spa, or,  all 4",
            "I stayed at the Ivy in November and it was wonderful! The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated and so serene. I especially love the bathroom, and the special touch of the bath salts \\\"buffet\\\". After a night out at the nearby distillery district, we enjoyed decadent desserts from George in the comfort of our room. The service was great. This was my 3rd time at Ivy and I expect I will return again",
            "I have not one complaint about this hotel. It is beautiful, and stunningly decorated. There are only four rooms, with private balconies, and they are clean and luxurious. Incredibly comfortable beds\\u002Fpillows. Gorgeous bathrooms with Bvlgari shampoos&ody washes. The Verity contains several meeting rooms, a library, and an all-womans' spa (odd, right?!). The staff was very kind, and helpful. We checked in late, our in-room safe didn't work, and they replaced it immediately. Another front desk manager (Michael?) went out of his way to help us find affordable transportation to an out-of-the way concert that we were trying to attend. We had a complimentary continental breakfast, which was delivered to the \\\"honor bar\\\" outside of the guest rooms. (I have never had freshly pressed cranberry juice!!). The George Restaurant, which is, essentially, below the guest rooms (though, we were never disturbed by the diners) is absolutely fabulous!!!!!!\\nMy only complaint is that this hotel is on a rather seedy section of the street. The downtown  location is ideal for great restaurants (Origin, Blowfish on Bay, Canoe), and Toronto highlights, it seems out of place. There are several, what appear to be, homeless shelters within a block of the hotel. East Queen Street seemed to have a constant flow of indigent people flowing in, and out, of the McDonalds on the corner. I felt a little uncomfortable walking back each night, and I am from NYC. We never had any issues, but it struck me as odd that this gem of a hotel was in the wrong neighborhood.",
            "Stay here ONLY if you want to feel pampered, rich and completely relaxed. Stay here ONLY if you like complimentary breakfast delivered to your room with fresh-squeezed orange juice and homemade chocolate scones. \\nStay here ONLY if you like the idea of being in the middle of a big city but waking on to your balcony to overlook a garden area that\\u2019s as peaceful as the countryside. \\n\\nThe pictures don\\u2019t lie. It\\u2019s every bit (and better) what the hotels pictures show. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed every second. \\n\\n10\\u002F10 the best hotel we\\u2019ve every stayed in. Thank you The IVY at Verity for giving these two perpetually tired parents their first night away!",
            "Spent a wonderful weekend in Toronto at The Ivy at Verity.  A boutique hotel with just 4 rooms. Our was beautifully decorated, spacious with an amazing bathroom.   They have thought of everything -- honor bar, round the clock concierge and unique touches like freshly brewed tea to enjoy while you soak in a huge tub soaking in specially chosen bath salts.   It was a truly magical experience.   Can't imagine every staying anywhere else in Toronto.   Book ahead so you won't miss out",
            "The Ivy at Verity is actually four lovely rooms within a private club for women, although they are available to anyone.  The rooms are large, beautifully presented, immaculate, and comfortable.  The bathroom was large and impressive.  One minor flaw (if you are a reader) is that the lighting is very low.  While not unpleasant it does make it a bit difficult to read once the drapes have been pulled.  During the day the large windows let in plenty of light.  The staff is about as accommodating as it is possible to be.  Breakfast is presented in the public room just outside the four separate guest rooms on trays that are then taken to one's own room (where there is a table and chairs perfect for eating).  Generally it is a continental breakfast, but it is possible to order some additions if one wishes.  There is a pod-style coffee maker available at all times, and while sweeteners are provided there was no milk or cream unless it was requested.  There is a small, private cafe\\u002Frestaurant within the complex that has a good, but limited menu, and another restaurant as well as a busy pub within the two adjacent buildings.  While there is no valet or in-house parking, there is a public lot immediately across the street.  The parking is metered (and expensive) but very convenient.  Just east of Yonge Street it is a bit out-of-the-way, but still only a few blocks to the Eaton Center.  It was easy to get a taxi to travel to the other parts of the city, or a short walk takes you to the Metro.  Cheap it was not, but very pleasant",
            "Who knew that I could travel a half hour from home and feel like I was in Paris?! We had a lovely stay at the Ivy for a 1-night getaway in the city. \\n\\nI can't compliment the hotel and it's staff enough. First and foremost was the European-inspired decor of this chic little boutique hotel - just stunning. With only 4 rooms, it's intimate and cozy, but doesn't feel 'small'.  \\n\\nWonderful spa, library and lounge area. The hotel rooms are excellent -  no detail spared. The walkout to the terrace was a nice surprise. \\n\\nThe 'honesty bar' in the sitting room down the hall was a personalized touch. \\n\\nWill definitely be back",
            "We stayed here for an evening and had dinner at George restaurant.  What a fabulous experience.  If you are travelling to Toronto, it is walking distance to the financial district, Yonge Street, the Eaton Center shopping mall and great restaurants.  The room was sooo cozy, heated flooring, spacious bathrooms with various scented bath salts, contemporary design.  The breakfast in the morning was right outside the door and we enjoyed eatting in bed.  Dinner at George was AMAZING.  The food, the service were top notch.  I highly recommend it.  There are only a few rooms, each one is decorated differently.  The spa though is women only, so sorry guys. If you are looking for a boutique hotel that is cozy, in a great location and can splurge, Verity is for you",
            "We live in Toronto, but I surprised my husband with  here for one night on our wedding anniversary in April 2014.  He had no idea there were even rooms at the Verity and was excited (perhaps unnecessarily) that we were visiting a \\\"ladies club\\\" for our anniversary, ha ha. Our experience was so positive from start to finish. It's such a little gem. Our room rivalled any hotel room we've been to around the world--gorgeous huge bathroom, comfy beds, beautiful amenties. The honour bar was lovely too, so quaint. Staff were excellent..rooms were beautifully maintained, well cleaned, front desk staff was attentive etc. My husband had in in room massage and I had a manicure downstiars--the BEST it lasted for over a week!)--plus one of the ladies gave me a make up lesson at the fun\\u002Finteractive make up bar. Spa is really lovely.  Then we had a great dinner at George (food was out of this world although the waiter was a bit haughty). Overall I would highly recommend the Ivy and the package we had. A great escape in the city",
            "This place is just fabulous. Beautiful decor and furnishings, the most comfortable hotel bed  I've ever slept in, excellent service and a delicious complimentary continental breakfast(with the hotel's own crab-apple preserve)",
            "We absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was so welcoming and helpful. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was perfect. \\nThis hotel is owned by the women's club and was originally used exclusively by the club for when they had guests in town. Now anyone can book a room if you are lucky enough to nab one. There are only four rooms in the entire hotel and they are separated away from the rest of the club so it is very quiet. The rooms are very large with a king bed and beautiful full wall windows with a door onto a private balcony. Each room is color coded and unique. the bathroom comes with heated floors, a separate room for the toilet, an amazing shower, and the largest bath tub I have ever seen. I am 6'2\\\" and I could stretch out in the tub with room to spare. The added bonus is the in house made bath salt that they provide in three different scents.\\nYou also get breakfast delivered to your door. It is not a large meal but it gets you through to lunch. \\nThe last thing I have to say is that you MUST have dinner at George while you are there. This restaurant specializes in tasting menus for all dietary plans. The biggest benefit is that after your three hour multi -course meal you just have to walk up the hidden staircase to your room (never leaving the building). \\nI will definitely stay here again if ever back in Toronto",
            "We had an excellent time here. The massage package with the room for two can be used by one person for the full hour by a RMT therapist. The breakfast consisted of coffee, a choice of freshly squeezed juice, pastry's, fresh fruit offered on a tray outside of your room. They have a small area to sit or you can bring your tray to your room.\\nThe hallways are so confusing of how to get to your room or even how to get to the reception area, although they were very accommodating to help you find your way. It was a nice treat with the spa downstairs for the following day.\\nVery close to the Eaton Centre. A great part of the city. It truly was a welcomed treat",
            "We just spent one blissful night at The Ivy at Verity. Could have stayed longer but the hotel was fully booked for the rest of the week. However, even the one night was enough for us to enjoy the wonderful surprises that this hotel offers. This place is a piece of heaven, when you enter the hotel through the Club \\\"Verity\\\" you are transported into another dimension, where your every wish is fulfilled. Our room was tasteful as it was beautiful, colors that soothe, bed linens that feel like \\\"cloud 9\\\", nothing missing or lacking. Best of all, we get to use the facilities of Verity's Sweetgrass Spa, and wine & dine at \\\"George\\\" Verity's 5-star restaurant, all under the same roof. After one night I am refreshed and rejuvenated, as if I spent a week at a resort. A place like this is hard to find, lucky for me I found it. Can't wait to return",
            "Great hotel, unique experience. Highly recommended. George Restaurant was also amazing. Friendly staff, good breakfast and complimentary drinks all day. We also liked the spa, which is for women only. A bit weird neighborhood, but quite close to everything",
            "Got a chance to stay at Ivy in colourful Room 3 (each of the 4 rooms is different in size or decor) on a Saturday night.  Pure bliss!  Huge bathroom with separate room for the toilet and separate large shower stall and huge soaker tub with choice of scented bath salts.  High-end Hastens bed, swivel wall-mounted flat screen large TV, desk, 2 upholstered chairs, overstuffed armchair, ottoman, actual balcony facing peaceful courtyard (over George restaurant), and complimentary continental breakfast (coffee ready to order) and honour bar (several full-size bottles but no gin; two kinds of wine and assorted beers kept on ice) available just outside the room for in-room enjoyment.  \\n\\nBeing a Saturday\\u002FSunday, the business centre\\u002Flibrary area of the private women's club upstairs was empty and the concierge said I could use it.  Although the gorgeous basement-level pool, hot tub, and spa area is women-only, I still recommend this place to couples if the man can skip that part.  We got the urban one-night getaway package, so a 4 course tasting menu at George was included.  The service at George was a little rough -- we weren't offered any upgrades or wine pairings and the amuse bouche and first two courses came out too quickly --  we hadn't even received our aperitif cocktails yet!\\n\\nIvy is significantly cheaper than staying at Hazelton but now that I've stayed overnight at both, I would choose Ivy again and again.  The only difference is the slightly smaller closet space at Ivy compared to the two-sided closet\\u002Fstorage area in Hazelton rooms, and the lack of a TV in the bathroom at Ivy.  Otherwise the room setup and comfort quality is the same.  Ivy provides Bulgari white tea scented toiletries along with the choice of 3 scented bath salts.  Hazelton provides a fridge in-room stocked only with wine products and teas whereas Ivy gives many choices just outside the room and a free breakfast (Ivy continental included 2 kinds of croissants, jam, apple strudel slices, an interesting coconut oatmeal porridge that tasted great at room temperature, fresh berry fruit salad, choice of orange or grapefruit juice, and hot tea or coffee on demand.)  Yes, Hazelton does room service and has a restaurant open for brunch on site, whereas George at Ivy does not provide that flexibility.  The indoor pool at Hazelton was a huge disappointment (no windows, awful lighting and no relaxation area around the pool) whereas the women-only pool at Ivy is lovely and even has an underwater treadmill!  Queen Street East between Church and Jarvis is no Yorkville.  But for $200+ less on average per night, Ivy offers better value at a similar standard",
            "My wife & I stayed 1 night after dropping our daughter off at the airport.  I booked the hotel & knew that it was locate in a women's club.  I didn't think that this would be an issue but as a man, I never felt completely comfortable there.  Basically, I was an interloper, not able to use the gym, massage must be in-room, etc.  The room itself was very nice. It was very large and very open, not what I would call cozy or relaxing.  We also ran into an issue with the television.  Basically, it didn't work.  After much trying the young woman at the desk got it reconnected but we were never able to access HBO which is what my wife was hoping for.  Breakfast was not bad but was not particularly filling.  All in all, not a bad stay but not one that I'd repeat, particularly give  the cost",
            "This hotel is amazing!  Concierge are very helpful and informative. Room 4 was very large, beautifully decorated with a balcony over looking the courtyard.  Lovely bathroom with bathtub, separate shower and heated floor.  Three types of scented bath salts are available for your bathing pleasure!  An honour bar is available with red and white wine and a selection of spirits.  Continental breakfast, including in house freshly baked croissants is left outside your door at 8am.  \\n\\nDinner is highly recommended at the award winning George Restaurant!\\n\\nI give this hotel 10 out of 10!  Can't wait to go back",
            "Great hotel, a nice surprise actually. Great location, easy to walk to main attractions in the city. The hotel is really unusally situated in an office building. The rooms are large and most likely recently furnished. Service was really good. Only downside is that some of what they offer, like gym, is women only.",
            "We chose the Ivy's Urban Retreat package for one night as a way to celebrate our anniversary in Toronto. In the city, there are no shortage of luxury hotel options, but it can be difficult to find a place to stay that is really in the \\\"boutique\\\" category while offering privacy, luxury, fun, and peace while away from home. In just about every category for evaluation, the Ivy excels. This 4-room hotel downtown stands out and above other options in Toronto, and we're thrilled to have discovered it.\\n\\nYou can request a particular room when booking, and we chose room #2. With a calming colour scheme, plenty of space, a gorgeous marble bathroom (deep tub and huge shower room!), and a large flat screen with a blu-ray player, it's well-outfitted, comfortable, and very quiet. You have access to a refreshments area with honour bar and complimentary soft drinks, as well as access to the members only lounge area, which we didn't make use of. Their packages have incredible value, and we had the chance to enjoy an included five-course meal at the onsite George restaurant and an hour long massage at the onsite Sweetgrass spa. \\n\\nTo clarify some confusion amongst the reviews and elsewhere, Verity is the parent company here and responsible for the spa and restaurant, as well as the hotel. The spa (and this includes all available fitness facilities) is women only, but this absolutely does not mean that men are somehow unwelcome. In fact, should you wish, men can request in-room spa services. As a male guest, I absolutely loved my stay here, and my partner was able to make use of the beautiful spa facilities. \\n\\nToronto seems to be a city where it can be difficult to feel as if value matches cost for accommodations. The Ivy at Verity bucks this unfortunate trend and offers an experience we hope to someday return for",
            "Our room was large and beautifully appointed with eclectic modern decor. \\nThe bathroom was massive, with a separate shower and tub (with complimentary menu of bath salts) and had a spa-like feel. \\nThe concierge was extremely helpful and courteous.\\nComplimentary breakfast is brought to the room (with pastries baked by the chef from the exquisite restaurant downstairs). \\nThe beautiful balcony overlooking the restaurant courtyard is a perfect spot to take breakfast. \\nThe room was very quiet, albeit a bit bright in the morning - I'd recommend blackout curtains. \\nAside from George (downstairs), Origin is another restaurant nearby that is worth a visit",
            "We always like to stay in what we call small luxury hotels or special places. The Ivy is both. In the hart of a former chocolate factory you find a hotel space that is very special. Great design, fine materials, very quiet airco, fine linen, great shower, lots of space for your clothes and bags. And breakfast is served in your room! At 08.00 it is outside your door, get it in and enjoy all you ordered the evening before. Very nice and helpful staff",
            "We stayed here after our wedding before going home to Etobicoke, and I am so happy that we did! We arrived late (about 1am?) and the concierge was there to greet us and take a breakfast order. The room was well-appointed - beautiful furniture, gorgeous lighting, a patio overlooking the courtyard.  The bed was easily the most comfortable I've ever slept on in my life. And the bathroom! HUGE tub, heavenly salts, separate toilet and shower stalls... just to die for. Breakfast was juice, coffee\\u002Ftea, pastries, yogurt & fruit -- and was waiting on a tray for us in the lobby area which also had a nice bar to choose from (though we weren't in the mood to take advantage of it seeing as it was 9am). I would recommend this place to everyone",
            "Amazing getaway in the heart of Toronto.  Great location, only four rooms in the entire hotel, gorgeous boardrooms, library, balconies.  The hotel rooms are enormous, luxurious, romantic and spotless.  The spa downstairs is just for women (which was kind of wonderful) but the male half of a couple might feel a little left out.  Then he should remind himself that he gets paid more than his wife does to do the same job\\u2026 and go relax in the giant bathtub instead",
            "The Ivy is a small unique hotel -  four rooms in total - all different and beautifully appointed.  The beds are the most comfortable ever, with the finest of linens.  Decor is simply gorgeous,  beautiful ly upholstered seating, exposed brick walls and lovely wallpapers, bamboo hardwood floors and bamboo tiles in the luxurious bathrooms. Each room has a balcony overlooking an inner city courtyard.  The Ivy is part of Verity Womens Club and upstairs from George Restaurant.  The club's spa and fitness facilities are open to guests .  You feel like a pampered personal friend  rather than a hotel guest..  A small guest lounge with a marble table with selection of fine spirits and wine is part of the lovely surroundings.  Definitely for discerning independent travellers who like to discover unique and special properties",
            "The Ivy is a hidden gem in the centre of Toronto.  Spacious beautifully decorated rooms, luxurious linens and the bathrooms are stocked with the best toiletries - a deep bath and separate shower stall.  You  feel pampered and regenerated.  Great dinner package options at George restaurant and spa options at the spa. Small and personal - treat yourself",
            "I absolutely love the Ivy Hotel and have stayed there several times.  It is a perfect retreat for a romantic get away with your partner and there are several packages available which include dinner at the hotel's George Restaurant.   I have also used the Ivy when having a girls' day with my sister, niece and mom at the adjacent Sweetgrass Spa and an evening out so the room was nice to come back to.   In addition, I have used the Ivy for business purposes if I book a corporate dinner at George or have meetings downtown the next day, the Ivy is conveniently situated in the downtown core.   The 4 room boutique hotel is luxurious and cozy with a unique ambience.  The staff and service is attentive. I am already looking forward to my next stay",
            "I've been staying in Marriotts, Hiltons and Holiday Inns for over 4 years with work, but it's only by coming to The Ivy that I'm reminded how good a hotel experience you can have if you go to the boutique places.\\nThe first thing is even though this is effectively 'an old boys club for women', my wife booked it for our first trip to Toronto and we both found it to be utterly beautiful, relaxing and a joy to stay in. We could happily move into room 3 and never leave, the bed and bathroom are brilliant, the honesty bar and espresso machine outside the room make you feel at home to come and go as you please, the staff were super friendly and helpful, and even though the spa is women only they allowed us in after hours. As for the George restaurant, we've never had a better tasting menu anywhere in the world. A rare foodie experience I'll not forget in a hurry.\\nOne of those places that genuinely nourishes your body and mind. Can't say enough good things about it",
            "The Ivy was the last word in luxury - from a $30,000 mattress (should've come with George Clooney!) to marble tiled bathroom and glorious Bulgari amenities. Sound-proofed room, a sumptuous continental breakfast daily to our door and so very much more - from check-in to departure - made this a stay I've not stopped talking about",
            "I am amazed by just how relaxing one night in the city actually was.  \\n\\nBut the bed is lovely.  And the aqua wallpaper in #3 is soothing.  And the design, in general, is excellent.  And the bathroom is exquisite (with great soaps and the like).  And they have this nice internal lobby where there's an honour bar and a Nespresso machine, which is actually where we enjoyed our dessert from George.\\n\\nI would've loved to stay for longer (though, well, it's not exactly a cheap stay), and I would've enjoyed the possibility of a massage.  I kind of wish I could stay here more often.  Shame it's not dog-friendly, and shame that the parking isn't included.  But these are definitely minor",
            "This centrally located downtown Toronto hotel is extremely spacious, beautifully appointed and impeccably conceived. I'd like to move in. (The continental breakfast delivered to your door, the heated flooring in the very large bathroom, the generous balcony overlooking the intimate brick courtyard, the gorgeous drapes and furniture...) And yes, of course, all the technology required for a 21st century traveler",
            "The Ivy isn\\u00B4t so much a classical hotel. It\\u00B4s a business club with serveral nice meeting lounges, a lady fitness studio, a spa and perhaps the best restaurant \\\"George\\\" I have ever eaten at. We were told - also there was no one, when we we stayed - that the Ivy is a hot spot for weddings in Toronto. And I can understand this.\\n\\nThe rooms - they only have four, so feel yourself luck if you get one - are big and lovely decorated, with over king size beds which might be the most comfortable I ever had sleeped in, a big bath - seperated shower and closet - with Bulgari toiletries and several different bathing salts available for disposal in the big bathing tube.\\n\\nThe breakfast - croissant, cake, fresh fruit and juice, coffee or tea, everything excellent - was offered on tray outside the room on an old french pastries table and had to be carried in your room. We ate it on our balcony with view to the patio. Great start of the day. Coffee (Nespresso) and softdrinks were complimentary the whole day. \\n\\nThe hotel itself is very central, probably 10 min walk to Eaton Center with a subway station just around the corner and big public parking space on the other side of the street.\\n \\nSo go there, even if you don\\u00B4t want to mary",
            "I wouldn't have even known this was their unless we were staying there as part of a wedding party, but it was truly a special little oasis in the city.  The room was massive by inner city standards.  There was a king size bed, little sitting are for reading and another one with a little table for eating\\u002Fdrinks.   There was also a large patio with a table overlooking a quiet courtyard.  Never once did it sound like we were in a city.  The bathroom was also huge and had a great assortment of quality soaps including 3 different scents of bath salts.   Room included a continental breakfast.  There also was an open area outside the room with complimentary soft drinks and cocktails for fee.  Would highly recommend this quiet, gem in the city",
            "The rooms at the Ivy are so beautiful, you really don't want to leave them.  Save time to enjoy the spa like bath, with an assortment of scented salts and heated floors - enjoy a drink or breakfast on the balcony overlooking the secluded patio of the George restaurant - and make sure you get your full eight hours sleep in the heavenly beds - amazing comfort and luxury.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, each one with a different interior design, and unlike anything you would get at a large chain hotel.  Within walking distance of downtown Toronto, the Ivy is conveniently located albeit off the beaten path.  We liked being able to enjoy a bottle of champagne in the seating area outside the rooms as a group - almost like being in your own home - before heading downstairs to the wonderful George restaurant. Personal and knowledgable concierge staff - access to Internet and computers - on site spa - and ambience from the exclusive Verity Women's Club.  I have stayed at the Ivy many times, and already am looking forward to my next visit",
            "This boutique hotel is exactly that. Small, but beautifully put together. Staff were all fantastic. Rooms perfect. Best bathrooms we've found in Canada, and when the weather allows a lovely veranda to sit on. Attached is a ladies health club and spa, and if I lived in Toronto I would join. Can you start one in England  - preferably near where I live \\uD83D\\uDE04 Husband and I had a champagne breakfast to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was lovely",
            "I found the Ivy on hotels.com. Thought it sounded unique and it is! Four gorgeously and differently appointed rooms. Huge bathroom with rain shower and deep soaking tub, including in-house-made, complimentary bath salts - a nice touch after a long day of walking. There is an honor bar with white wine, liquors, and soft drinks. Also tea bags and instant coffee. Continental breakfast is included and it is quite ample - yogurt\\u002Fgranola, boiled egg, croissant or muffin, juices, and coffee\\u002Fcream. Really nice.\\n\\nThe only difficulty that I encountered was a previously unannounced electricity outage one night from 10pm to 4am the following morning. WEIRD. A letter left in my room. No explanation. Battery lantern and flashlight provided. \\n\\nThe building is in a sort of run-down block of Queen St just a bit east of the better parts of Queen St West. But I did not feel unsafe. \\n\\nThere is a great women's clothing store a few doors down. Don't miss it! And an excellent antiques store in the the next block east. Plenty of good restaurants a block or two away as well as the upscale George attached.\\n\\nLovely subterranean swimming pool and hot tub. And a spa",
            "This hotel is part of a small, elegant upscale spa and restaurant complex and women's club. The restaurant is superior as are the spa facilities and the rooms.  Decoration is in impeccable taste in every part of the complex.  The beds are British--Hypnos is the brand.  They are ultra-luxury in price; more importantly, they make for an exceptional sleep. We had a perfect escape to an elegant oasis in the middle of Toronto in the winter.  Highly recommended",
            "Strange setting, 4 room hotel inside a women's only networking club in central Toronto.\\nSet in a beautifully renovated industrial complex, the room was a treat to the senses, salts for the bath, special wood floors in the bathroom. Everything about the room was perfect. We also had a beautiful little terrace overlooking a courtyard where we had breakfast.\\nThe affiliated George restaurant was also magnificent, and all the staff was attentive and knowledgable.\\nI loved the place.\\nI'll definitely go back",
            "To start off, the reception greeted me with smiles and hospitality.  The room was extremely clean and set up with bath salts and nice music.  The bed was like drifting on a soft cloud.  The decor and art were stunning and well thought out.  I felt at home and much relaxed in this hotel and didn't want to leave.  Especially after an amazing massage done right in the convenience of my room.  The staff was extremely accommodating and allowed me a late check out, so I could soak in the tub with some lavender bath salts (tub big enough for two).  mmmm...\\n\\nI would return to this hotel at any opportunity I may have",
            "Things I loved about the Ivy:\\nThe pillows\\nGiant bath and nice bath salts\\nThe fancy ginger ale (Fever Tree)\\nThe hairdryer (no awful travel ones here)\\nThe balcony\\nFree Nespresso\\nThe lovely staff\\nThe Bulgari ammenities (I want to smell like this forever)\\nPretty wallpaper\\nFresh flowers everywher",
            "Definitely not your usual hotel. Looking for a home away your home.....This is the place where to go when you are in Toronto. Even if not located in some fancy neighborhoods, this place is a gem. At first a \\\"Women's club\\\" , the Ivy offers some rooms now... Mine was .. Yes ... awesome. A large room with a large bed, a pretty big bathroom with for the first time ever of my life a bath salt \\\"bar\\\" ... Breakfast it serve at your door at the requested time. Might be a little bit light (missing some toasts and butter), ordered croissants and chocolate brioche and ends-up with a muffin with grapes   ... But this was good.\\nTeam is great ... I will highly recommend this place ... Especially if you are a woman ... Next time i will try the SPA",
            "The Ivy at Verity is a tiny hotel. The set up seems odd at first... it is an exclusive women's club with gym, spa, library, lounges etc, and tucked away on a upper floor, the 4 lovely and spacious guest rooms.  The rooms overlook a court yard and face the windows of an ad agency, where you can see folks working away. At first it felt a bit like we were in a bedroom at work. We kept our drapes closed and all was well. As a woman, all of the amenities were amazing. I think if I had been travelling with a male companion it would have been disappointing.  I was in room three and it was BEAUTIFUL.  Just my style. Very comfortable king bed, incredible bathroom with an irresistible bathtub. All of the soaps and salts and lotions were really lovely and great quality. The room had lots of plush seating, and huge balcony. The honour bar, just outside of the rooms was a really nice touch - although when I was there it was not properly stocked and was never replenished, even after two calls to the concierge. Location is central enough to walk downtown, has a transit stop right out front, and there is paid parking directly across the street. I thought the breakfast was quite good. This will always be my first choice hotel when I stay in Toronto, I really loved it",
            "We live in Toronto and were celebrating- my birthday, my husbands birthday and my best friend's and her husband's birthday all fall within a month of each other, so we decided this year to celebrate in style- a night at the Ivy. We kicked things off first at the Sweetgrass spa (for women only) then enjoyed a 10 course tasting menu on George's beautiful courtyard patio.\\n \\nGoing with another couple allowed me to gawk at their room too (room #1). I love how this hotel has only four rooms and all are tasteful and elegant, and so different. Our room (#3) was a glamorous blend of modern mixed with classic timeless materials, a nod to their chocolate factory past. Gorgeous blue wallpaper is charming against the relic brick of a bygone era. The rooms themselves are massive, much roomier than any other downtown hotel I've seen. With different seating areas to recline and relax, including a sunny deck that faces George's patio, my husband and I loved every minute of our stay. The bathroom has a super deep soaker tub and inviting aromatic bath salts- they have clearly anticipated your every thought! \\nOne feature I loved was the Samsung tablet that you use to control the television, but also acts as a portable TV, which they have linked to Netflix...cue the Orange is the New Black marathon! \\n\\nMy bestie's room was an intimate portrait of a Parisian hotel, soft pink striped wallpaper was welcoming and warm. Her room was every bit as luxurious as mine, every detail carefully constructed. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back, absolutely adore the staff, spa and restaurant here. It's a rare gem in a city full of over-done, over hyped hotels (IMHO). Nice gestures like the honour bar and delicious complimentary breakfast are just the finishing touches to a spoiled brat weekend. Thanks Ivy",
            "Room could not have be nicer or more comfortable.\\nI wanted to give all top reviews becauae of this ....but a few things lacking.\\nService was average, there are other things in the building womans club,gym,spa so hotel service was a bit off. Like last on list.\\nThe breakfast was placed so nice, but was not really up to par. Juice and fruit good,but breads were a bit tough with no where to heat. Forgot our turn down service two of the four nights (there are only four rooms) \\",
            "This is a hotel within a women-only club, so only females have access to the pool, spa and gym.  The rooms are great, and service is excellent, so I didn't mind staying in the room or walking in the neighborhood while my wife enjoyed the facilitie",
            "The Ivy at Verity ( a private women's club in downtown Toronto) attached to 5 star dining at George Restaurant with it's own private courtyard patio.\\nPosh but cozy, exclusive but welcoming. So beautiful and stylish but with plenty of substance. The people are warm and helpful and the beds are Hastens so the best sleep ever acheived. There is a Verity spa (complete with hot tub, steam room, and sauna ) on property called Sweetgrass that is exclusive for women but men staying in the hotel can have treatments in their hotel room. They even have fitness facilities (again, exclusive to women)  and you can add on a yoga class if you want for a nominal fee.\\nFabulous stay, incredible bed, God is here, in the deails",
            "Stayed in room #4 for one night. Concierge was so accommodating- helped with parking and showing us all the ammenities. \\nThe room was spacious and beautiful. Large patio. Complimentary bath salt bar over the spa tub, separate stand up shower and toilet rooms. \\nThe hotel also had a bar for guests in a small sitting area outside the room. It worked based on the honesty system- each drink you had you recorded and were charged 6$\\u002Falcoholic beverage at the end of your stay. They had wine, beer, and all sorts of hard liquor + mix. \\nThere was a complimentary continental breakfast waiting on a table outside your room starting at 715- and when you were ready you called the concierge to bring a pot of fresh coffee. \\nOverall lovely, romantic spot. We also purchased the 4 course tasting menu at George which was amazing. Will return!",
            "If you like plush  guesthouses then this is for you. Big rooms, beautiful big bathroom and not far from the nicer parts of town. Extensive basics \\u002Fservices are explained to you upon arrival and so you do feel like you're in a plush guesthouse rather than a efficient luxury hotel. The mini bar and breakfast area (even for in room breakfasts) are in a small shared space. The reception is one of those low down desks hence the guesthouse\\u002F plush b&b feel. Men cannot use any of the spa facilities, not even the gym :( Great for a traveling business woman who spends a lot of time in plush hotels and wants a more the social experience you would get in a b&b\\u002Fguesthouse.",
            "A Gem in a perfect location. Where do I begin. I was greeted by a super nice and friendly staff. I was early for an appointment but interested in my wedding possibly there. I met with planner immediately who was a sweetheart. Just for any thinking about a wedding there, the prices can't be beat!  When I returned I was taken up to my room. The hotel is so lush, with velvet, satin,art work, a library and lounge. One of my favourite features is the honour bar which has inexpensive drinks, free pop, and a espresso coffee machine and tea. The best part was it was right out my bedroom door. The continental breakfast was just the right amount and delicious. The room was just WOW!  It was huge and the wonderful scent from the bath crystals was light yet a delight to the senses. The fixtures were unusual and very artsy. The bathroom was huge! Everything was soft and plush from towels, bedding and bath robes. I only had the pleasure of one night so not enough time to explore all the hotel and neighborhood had to offer. The menu was on a tablet, unlike some hotels where they are a bit used and messy. If you needed something, a friendly staff member was there quickly. I really can't say enough about this wonderful hotel and staff!  Thank you for an amazing night",

            "Excellent rooms very comfortable beds and pillows. Excellent housekeeping very friendly staff but management leaves something to be desired. I was there for three nights and the first night. I ended up in my room at 1 AM and fell asleep at 2 AM and was woken by a fire alarm that was told to me by the initial manager, I spoke to caused by faulty equipment, this lasted approximately 20 minutes with a siren next to my bed as well as the hallways which made it impossible to fall back to sleep as I had a meeting at 7 AM. I complained to the second manager and they told me there was nothing they were willing to do all I was looking for was either a night crowd , or a future credit as I was not rewarded with what I paid for which was a peaceful night sleep. A Holiday Inn will credit you if your neighbour makes noise in the middle of the night. I would think a high-end hotel would consider this type of disturbance more than something that should be blown off. Basically two managers blew me off when I commented with the second manager, telling me it was a false alarm and not faulty Equipment. I dined in the hotel as well. The food was good although overpriced, but mostly the fact that the management we\\u2019re not concerned with the fact that I lost night sleep something that really surprised me",

Beautiful room and view.\\nWedding was great, food and drinks \\uD83D\\uDC4C.\\nBreakfast at the Cafe was nice but expensive of course.

Dinner in the restaurant was excellent with a great choice of food, the bass was delicious! We went in the rooftop pool in the evening, was amazing and warm, really enjoyed it despite it being minus 5 \\uD83D\\uDE01 Would definitely go back for a quick mini break in the city, had great vies of the CN tower and islands. Breakfast was great, we ordered room service and it arrived hot and fresh. Room was great, clean, spacious with everything we needed",
            "This is literally one of the nicest hotels I\\u2019ve ever stayed in.  We only booked in for one night because we were attending a concert at the nearby Budweiser Stage, and were given a room on a really high floor with a spectacular view of the venue and surrounding area. The room itself was immaculate, with huge windows and all mod cons, and I can honestly say the bed was the comfiest one I\\u2019ve ever slept in\\u2026 it was like sleeping on a cloud!  The hotel isn\\u2019t cheap but it\\u2019s worth the price for a treat, and we\\u2019d go back in a heartbeat the next time we\\u2019re going to see a band in the area.  The only slight niggle was that someone else\\u2019s breakfast was added on to our bill in error, which shouldn\\u2019t really happen if proper checks are done, but this was removed with no quibbling on checkout, so we had no complaints",
            "What a great hotel! Terrific amenities and an incredibly friendly, responsive staff. We were in Room 1116 and had a beautiful view back on to downtown Toronto. The room was clean, they provided water daily, the coffee machine in the room was a Nespresso, etc. We needed extra pillows and they sent them up promptly. \\n\\nWe ate at all three dining options (Cafe X, Roses and Valerie) and had a good meal or snack at each. The views from Valerie are gorgeous!\\n\\nThe only downside, which is small in my opinion, is the beautiful pool area is small and, therefore, they limit the number of persons who can use it at any given time. During summer, you make a reservation for a two-hour block of time there. But, the view is stunning and again, the staff are great. \\n\\nWe had no trouble getting Ubers\\u002FLyfts. There is a shared bike rack right across the street. and the street cars stop nearby. In other words, we had no trouble getting anywhere. While not in the heart of the downtown area, you are so close that it is an easy walk, ride, or bike ride to get there.\\n\\nWe were here with family, ages 13-64, and we all enjoyed this stay. Highly recommend! And if we return to Toronto, this is where we will stay",
            "If you are considering a stay in a \\u201Cluxury\\u201D hotel in Toronto avoid Hotel X. I stayed here with a few friends in their junior suite and had the most horrible experience. The service doesn\\u2019t match the exorbitant cost of the room. The taps in all the bathrooms were boiling hot leaving it impossible for us to wash our faces at night, when we called the front desk (after countless attempts someone finally answered) the resolution was to \\u201Clet it run for 5 minutes\\u201D. For a place that seems to be \\u201C5-star\\u201D I would expect that all rooms have decent hot\\u002Fcold water options. They never answered the phone in a timely manner when we had requests. We were also scheduled at the Guerlain Spa the next day and requested the room to be kept until our appointment was over so we could return and change, they refused to accommodate this request even though it was only until 1:30pm leaving them plenty of time to clean the room for the next check in (3:00pm). It would have been the least they could do given the mishap in the room to begin with. For a junior suite I was incredibly underwhelmed, the lights were confusing and dim in one of the bathrooms and overall there was nothing spectacular to justify the cost of staying here. Only positive remarks I have are for the view from the room and the beautiful spa. I\\u2019ve had much better customer service at significantly cheaper\\u002F lower star hotels. Just don\\u2019t expect much besides the architecture and views from this place. Overhyped and overpriced",
            "Hotel X exceeded all expectations! Since our vehicle was too high for self park, the bellhop offered vallet parking for the same price. Check in was seemless. About an hour into our stay room service brought up complementary chocolate covered strawberries since it was mentioned we were in town for our anniversary.\\n\\nWe booked the pool for 2 hours and it was wonderful! \\n\\nWe were able to walk to Budwiser Stage for a concert in under 5 minutes.\\n\\nThe bed was very comfortable, room was well furnished, clean and a beautiful view of the city skyline and the waterfront! As well as a nice selection of coffee and amenities in the room.\\n\\nWe had breakfast at Rose's and the food was delicious.\\n\\nThere was an issue with food that we did not order being added to our room, but was promptly removed and apologies given (mistakes happen)\\n\\nWe will be back soon!",

Front desk staff were very organized and professional, restaurant staff were cheerful and amiable. Room was well appointed and clean.

            "This review is a little late in coming, but as they say, better late than never.... Hotel X... where do I start. Grandeur in size, exuberant in style and excellence in customer service.   My husband and I were there for our anniversary in December of 2019.   We loved the facility, there is so much to do.   It was everything we wanted and more for our anniversary.  A special thanks  to Director of Sales, Saira.  Her passion shines through, each time she talks about what the hotel has to offer.  If it wasn't for her we would not have enjoyed the hotel as much as we did.  Saira, is passionate about this facility and presents this to clients with great pride.  This library hotel is equipped with books everywhere, borrow a book from anywhere  in the hotel, take it to your room or the pool side and  enjoy it.  The hotel has a theatre, an art gallery, an all season outdoor pool, state of the art tennis court and gym...  The resturants and the VIP lounge offers great good selections. \\nIf you are visiting as a family, there is tons to do for the kids.  \\nWe loved our stay so much that we will be returning with our family soon. \\nOnce again thank you Saira for making our stay so memorable. Looking forward to coming back soon.",
            "Everything about this hotel was incredible. We went for a concert at the Budweiser Stage, which is across the street, so we saved all the time, stress, costs and hassle of getting to our event. What we saved on travelling around was worth spending extra for this hotel. Also only 18 minutes from the Pearson airport and across the street from the Billy Bishop. The rooms were clean with a big bathroom, large desk for eating (and a small table and chairs) - instead of having to eat on the beds. The staff were the most accommodating we\\u2019ve ever dealt with, and we travel a lot. Everything was accommodated quickly and kindly, and they treated the kids like gold. The rooftop pool is beautiful, the amenities plentiful - but the best part for my family was the Movie Screening Room. We booked in easily and watched Netflix on the big screen in the best chairs - and the staff even had popcorn waiting for us! I can\\u2019t say enough. An incredible experience with an outstanding hotel staff. Loved every minute \\uD83D\\uDC97 Thank you so much",
            "I wanted to do something special for my husband's birthday this year and when I passed by this hotel on my way home from a meeting one day, it immediately captured my eye and thought that this hotel and location was perfect to surprise my husband on a mini getaway for his birthday in the city. I made reservations 2 days before we checked in and because I wanted to make my husbands surprise birthday extra special, I decided to upgrade our room. I quickly called the hotel to make the arrangements and they made the changes with no problem. On the day of our check-in I decided last minute that I wanted to include balloons and a small dessert prior to checking in. When I spoke to the concierge, she said that they required up to 24hrs notice to have the balloons set up in which I understood and accepted that it was okay. Once we arrived, the hotel was beautiful! We were greeted by smiling faces and the reception staff were so nice. They even gave our son a little stuffed animal as a welcome gift. When we got to our room and I opened the door, to my surprise there were balloons and a small pastry that read \\\"Happy Birthday\\\". They gave us a stunning view of the city which added the extra surprise! Everything in the room was spotless and so clean. They were even so thoughtful to include some bath essentials for my son and had laid them so nicely in the crib. A few minutes after settling into the hotel room, we heard a knock on the door. When we opened it, my husband received a special delivery of a bucket of beer. At this moment, we were beyond grateful for the amazing treatment we received from this hotel. We have never been treated with upmost tremendous service. Everything about this hotel was spectacular - from the staff, to the decor, the room and the most comfortable bed I've ever slept in, and just overall experience. This hotel lives up to it's standards and beyond. I couldn't have been more pleased that I chose Hotel X to surprise my husband with on his birthday. This is one of our top hotels thus far. We would definitely stay here again! Thank you Hotel X for your wonderful service!",
            "We recently visited this establishment. I travelled with 10 of my close friends. We are all between the ages of 40 and 50 and we\\u2019re all very disappointed with the accommodations. We purposely booked the weekend at this hotel for our bachelorette party because of the amenities that they offered first off our experience was to be started at the rooftop restaurant, which, of course was no fault to the restaurant got cancelled because of the rain, however They had no accommodations for us alternatively, in the hotel therefore we had no dinner reservations. We had to go to roses social, which was OK but the menu is just for pub food basically And of course it was too late to get any reservation at a nice restaurant in Toronto so even though they had interior seating for Valerie, they did not accommodate us because they were overbooked\\nThe hotel was extremely packed way too many people and therefore even to get some lunch, it was impossible. The caf\\u00E9 was closed at 3:00 PM and we ordered room service, which was our only choice since everything else was packed and it took over an hour and a half to get any type of food., Service Food was good once we actually received it\\nFollowing our dinner was supposed to be entertainment on level 27 as well as the lobby bar, which is a public bar that they normally have open to which were closed due to the 27th floor for personal party and the lobby bar is completely closed when they knew they had a full Capacity hotel that was further from the downtown region. I called to discuss charges on my card as well as my disappointment and of course no return call. No one seem to know or care about anything there Other than the one bartender at the pool bar Who completely resonated with us. \\nI would never return to this establishment. It was a complete disappointment",
            "Here is an example of someone thinking that bigger, flashier, and over the top is better. Wrong. Aside from the front desk staff that were amazing this hotel is bereft of any atmosphere at all. \\n\\nLet me start with the food. It was consistently horrible. And I mean bordering on a joke. I was here attending a business meeting. All I can say is the offerings were bizarre and poor quality. Sandwiches that looked like they were bound for a grade 1 lunchbox. A hot breakfast that for some reason provided cold hard boiled eggs instead of hot eggs. \\n\\nLighting in the room is weird. Turn off the main and you cannot turn on the bathroom light. I don\\u2019t get it. \\n\\nPetros82 food was merely adequate. Fish was overcooked. Octopus was tough. And the vegetable chips were drowning in grease. The waiter also spent the evening wiping his face with the palm of his hand and coughing into his palm rather than his arm. At $500 for four people the quality was far below what was expected. \\n\\nMaxx\\u2019s Kitchen was also sad. Stale pastry; cold dry eggs on the hot table. And French toast cut into tiny squares that were also cold. Terrible. \\n\\nNow I get to the Falcon Skybar on 27th floor. The service was the worst in the entire hotel. While tables waited endlessly for drinks and incorrect food orders, the staff stood around the bar surfing social media together on their phones. At one point I counted five staff standing there doing nothing but talking with each other. It seemed being a customer was an inconvenience to them. \\n\\nI will certainly not return on my own accord to this hotel",
            "I will have to say, my stay was  very frustrating. It was my anniversary and the hotel did nothing to celebrate it. Literally nothing, zero hospitality.\\n1) at the SPA they mixed up my couples massage and took us separate. We ended up getting into one room and they did give us free samples after due to the mix up\\n2) The front desk says you can only book a 2 hour time slot for the rooftop pool. So we go an I see other couples granted back to back time slots and when I asked the worker at the pool, they said front desk granted it. This is my anniversary, are others \\\"buying\\\" their time? They wouldnt even let us sit in a complete empty seating area. In addition, it took 35 mins and going to a waiter 3 times for us to order food. The waiters were not interested, very slow.\\n3) Then my wife and I figure, lets go the Valerie to get a quick bite to eat, they say we are not allowed because brunch is over. Yet its all completely empty and we could even sit!\\n4) We go to the ROSA COCINA resturant and again, they recognize its our anniversary and dont bring ANYTHING to recognize our day.\\n\\nI told front desk about this and they did nothing and jus said sorry. TO be honest, this is a very nice hotel with lots to do. But I will say, it is by far the worst service Ive ever had anywhere I have ever gone. And they could care less about it being my anniversary.\\n\\nHonestly, dont go and save your money",
            "Stayed here for two nights in a suite for a wedding (October 14-16). The views are unparalleled and the room was well equipped and classically decorated \\u002F furnished. Not super modern or chic, but tastefully done.\\n\\nThe staff were extremely accommodating and offered us complimentary parking, late check-out, chocolate-covered strawberries and hastily catered to multiple requests without any issue whatsoever. Top grades all around.\\n\\nWe didn\\u2019t have an opportunity to take advantage of the many amenities the property has to offer, and didn\\u2019t eat at the restaurants either. That being said, we did order room service for breakfast, and although a few more options would have been nice, what we did order off the menu was done to perfection",
            "Upon check in after having booked room months in advance, I was taken by a very kind and polite young man from Ireland, Chris, to a high floor with King Size Bed as requested. Upon reaching the room I found that my 6'7\\\" 265 pound frame was supposed to check in to a wheel chair accessible room. This is not at all what I had requested. My Business booked and paid for three rooms for a total of 8 nights worth of business, over $3000 worth of revenue to your property. Manager Nick, was not able to accommodate a resolution aside from moving me to the 19th floor. There were not any considerations provided for this nor any throughout the remainder of our stay. We visited the 28th floor bar on several occasions spending over a thousand dollars. The very fit chap that interacted with us a number of times was very brusque, overly concerned about our group and whether or not we could attend the patio and then overly brusque regarding our immediate need to pay for our expensive beverages prior to being on the patio once it was pointed out that others were out there and what indeed was the issue with our also being out there. Not the type of experience we expected for the price we paid and the excitement we all anticipated being at the X Hotel and having the opportunity to enjoy a view and experience of the 28th floor over looking Lake Ontario. The convenience to our trade show at Enercare center made the X seem the right choice. While I appreciate how busy you folks were I believe there were some missed opportunities in compassion and remedy that would have created the experience we had anticipated and hoped for.",
            "To say that I knew I picked the right place from the moment we walked in would be an understatement, because I knew well ahead of time that we were in great hands from just the email correspondence I had with the Hotel X team to prepare for the occasion. \\n\\nFor context, I had booked the hotel for my partner and I to retire to after celebrating a relationship milestone in downtown Toronto. I wanted to show as romantic a gesture as I could to cap off the night and made several specific requests about the room and its overall presentation to have a totally personalized experience. They understood the mission and executed in a manner that exceeded any expectation I had. \\n\\nOn its own, the hotel is already something like a paradise on earth. It has that high-end, luxurious atmosphere the moment you walk in - it is beautiful in every sense of the word and would impress anyone who chose to stay. \\n\\nThat said, what's really prompting this review is that level of care that their team handled my requests with. The team managing reservations promptly answered all my questions and were proactive in their communications. The concierge team and anyone else involved in finding me a room that met my requirements and decorating it as I envisioned delivered in an enormous way. It felt like I had very motivated friends handle the task for me with the level of precision in their output.\\n\\nEverything was perfect, and I couldn't be happier with my stay. Beautiful room, impressive building, and exceptional service",
            "One of the most comfortable and exquisite hotels I have ever stayed in. The  Hospitality service upon check-in was excellent.  Nick made sure everything went smoothly and explained all that the hotel had to offer.  We were able to enjoy the roof-top pool, an amazing state of the art fitness facility, and a very comfortable room with a sunset view.  \\nWe ate dinner at Roses Cocina where the food was good, but the servers seemed to have needed a little more help.  It could have been just a busy night, but hopefully the next time we visit, this restaurant will have worked that out.\\nRoom service for breakfast came right on time and the food was delicious!\\nWe have since booked two more stays, with very special thanks to Edwin in reservations and Stephen, the Concierge",
            "Hotel was lovely, rooms were clean, was a beautiful space, but very disappointed in guest experience.\\n\\nFelt as though we were unable to use most of the in-house complimentary amenities from the concierge car service to pool. Almost everything was booked up by the time we checked-in for our one night stay and the hotel was chosen specifically for what it offered. We were able to use the screening room which was great, but the room was clearly not cleaned before our reserved time as there was other guests trash throughout the space\\u002F all over the floor.\\n\\nGlad they\\u2019re investing in a second pool because for what was able to be reserved (an outdoor dining chair for 1 hour as other guests had thrown their towels on pool loungers when they were not needed) is not a relaxing or luxury hotel experience.\\n\\nPlease do better for your guests who are not there for\\u002F apart of weddings",
            "My stay here was so amazing! It was a great staycation. The COVID protocol is on point. All the staff wear their masks correctly, self cleaning elevator buttons, sanitizer everywhere, pool bookings are 2 hours so you always get time at the pool, the lounge chairs are spaced out as well as seating in the restaurants.\\n\\nThe staff were all so nice. We got a sweets tray upon welcome, early check in, late check out, extra pool bookings, free parking, breakfast for two, room upgrade. I recommend booking the bed and breakfast package - it's worth it!\\n\\nNo complaints at all. Great job Hotel X and thank you!",
            "Managed to sneak away with the hubby for a weekend at the end of last summer and had such an amazing time.  The views, staff and facilities were fantastic!  Was a little skeptical given the situation but felt immediately at ease from the moment we got there.  Staff was very attentive, and I really liked the added touch of being able to communicate everything through text message.  I needed extra towels and a facecloth and just texted.  So convenient!  Discovered later that they had tennis courts?  Wow, wish I knew beforehand so I could have brought the right shoes!\\n\\nNow I know and will definitely be back once this COVID stuff is done",
            "Hotel is very nice and modern!  It is close to the Budweiser Concert venue so perfect if you are going to an event there.  There is not a lot else within a 10 minute walking distance and while you can walk several kilometers into downtown, easier to take an Uber which wasn't the most convenient.  Our room also overlooked a festival that was apparently happening that weekend and there was a DJ until midnight both nights.  It was very loud.  Elevators are also very fast!  The pool was crowded and much smaller than it looks online.  There are reservations but I don't think they were enforcing people to leave after their two hours time slot.  We had no room to sit when we were there as it was completely full (came up about 20 min into our 2 hour block).  Weather was a little cool so we decided not to stay.  Better management of the pool, letting guests know about the loud festival, and location to downtown would make this a 5 rating.  If we go back for a concert would definitely stay here a night but other than that would pick somewhere closer to downtown or the harbour area",
            "Absolutely fantastic hotel that, although pricey, provides an overall experience that justifies the extra expense.  This hotel has the most spectactlar athletic facilities we have ever seen in a hotel and the rooftop pool is wonderful (thoughfully designed with a partition that allows both indoor and outdoor use during winter).  Breakfast (not included in the room rate) at Roses Cafe was very good and reasonably priced for the quality.  The nearest streetcar station (509 & 511) is a 5 minute walk and the location is great for events at the Coca-Cola Coliseum and Convention Centre.  Staff were responsive and helpful.  We will definitely stay here again when back in Toronto",
            "Thanks to the great staff and accommodations at Hotel X my family enjoyed an amazing two-day winter break stay in Toronto. My teenage boys enjoyed the part-indoor, part-outdoor infinity pool on the 28th floor, even though it was January. The Aurora Winter Festival along the lake was amazing and a short walk from the hotel. The hotel was kind enough to provide comp tickets. We also received free tix to the Second City Improv performance at one of the two theaters in the hotel, which the entire family enjoyed. One of the my boys loves books and thoroughly enjoyed the library at the property. My boys also enjoyed the attached sports facility where we played basketball and ping pong and fitness center for free. Because we were celebrating my wife's birthday, the staff was also kind enough to surprise her with a special treat in our hotel room. We totally recommend adding the Library Club Lounge to your experience. The breakfast and happy hour and attentive staff are totally worth the extra expense. My wife also enjoyed her time at the onsite spa, where again the staff and treatment could not have been better. Hotel X was truly the highlight of our Toronto experience",
            "Do not stay here if you expect any service as a hotel guest. So unwelcoming and absolutely not worth the steep price. I\\u2019m from Toronto and paid for a one bedroom suite which cost just over $1000 for a bachelorette. Might as well have stayed at home.  I called room service to order 2 martinis and the lady on the other line said \\u201Cwe don\\u2019t do that\\u201D. When asked what that means she said they don\\u2019t provide alcohol, which is fine but she didn\\u2019t tell me what my options were since there was no in-room bar fridge. When pressed she stated that they only have \\u201Ccanned alcohol\\u201D and if I want a martini I should call the front desk and they can get one from one of the restaurants. Long story short, after about a dozen unanswered calls to front desk and guest services I was told they can\\u2019t help me and my best bet was to try to go to the restaurant myself and get the drinks. To be clear, they weren\\u2019t actually sure this would work. I also highly doubt the restaurant would allow me to walk around the hotel with 2 martinis\\u2026 \\n\\nI also booked the hotel solely for the pool which we basically couldn\\u2019t use. My checkout was at 12 but apparently I could only book the pool from 9-11 EVEN THOUGH checkout was at 12. They don\\u2019t stipulate this when you book the hotel unless it\\u2019s in MICRO print somewhere I didn\\u2019t see. We got there around 9:30 am and there were no lounge chairs. We had to sit on hard, uncomfortable patio chairs and were forced to leave at 11 am. \\n\\nDo not stay here and use you hard-earned money to go to a hotel that services their guests. \\",
            "I was tasked with finding a hotel for our group in Toronto. Having never really spent time in the city (besides the airport), I chose based on location, price point, and reviews. We chose Hotel X, and were extremely glad we did. Modern, clean, professional\\u002Fhelpful staff, very upscale\\u2026plus Starbucks basically right in the hotel. All the things that I look for in a great hotel! We ended up booking adjoining rooms that had two queen beds in one, and a king bed, (large bathroom - two sinks) and living room in the other. Wow! Perfect for our needs! The large windows and views from our room of the water\\u002Fcity skyline were fantastic. We had only very minor issues, and not worth removing a star for, but I will mention in terms of feedback for the hotel. No ice available on the hotel floor, so you have to call down for ice. It\\u2019s not a huge deal, but we didn\\u2019t like having to bother staffers and wait for ice. Also, the rooms had a \\u201Cmain\\u201D light switch, that if you didn\\u2019t have on, meant the bathroom lights wouldn\\u2019t go on. This caused a bit of stress until we figured it out. Again, minor things, but this is an honest review. We didn\\u2019t take advantage of the cool things available in the hotel on this trip (screening room, Pilates, tennis court etc) but hope to next time. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at the restaurant Valerie on the hotels\\u2019 top floors - great sushi and atmosphere! Overall, we were very happy with the hotel and would definitely stay again",
            "This hotel is not only sleek and modern but a perfect place to stay when attending a concert at Bud Stage.  A quick walk over saves so much stress in having to find parking and waiting in traffic.  Had a delicious meal at ROSES Cocina and room service breakfast was amazing as well.  Staff was professional and friendly including the valet staff who did their best to try and keep us dry during a rain storm.  Only real improvement note I would make was when at the pool we didn't see anyone coming around to take drink orders.  We had to go in and order and pick up drinks ourselves.  Not sure if poolside drink service is usually available but may be a missed opportunity for those wanting to enjoy a drink or two while at the pool.  We had two teenagers as well with us who really enjoyed everything about the stay and have already asked to go again!  Thank you for a great night",
            "We had originally booked a room here for our wedding weekend in 2020. After postponing and eventually cancelling the big wedding, we weren't able to get a refund on the room so we used the excuse for a mini honeymoon. The service was excellent, all staff very friendly and responsive. The one bedroom suite was beautiful, with views of both the water and the city skyline. Booking reservations at the pool was efficient, as was reserving a table at the Falcon Sky bar.  We had drinks there on Friday night, great atmosphere, great DJ, only complaint was no drink menu to see a list of cocktails or have any idea of pricing. \\nFor a suite, I thought the bar area could have been a bit better equipped; the mini fridge is extremely small, not many glasses or extra utensils\\u002Fwine tools for entertaining. \\nLighting in the room was excellent, always appreciate dimmer switches! \\nWe tried to book the car service that drops guests off within a 5km radius of the hotel, however  it's not running due to Covid...this seemed a little strange as taxis\\u002FUbers are all operating with easy protocols in place. \\nThe rooftop pool is really nice, great views and limited capacity which means you can't stay for more than two hours but it doesn't get crowded which we appreciated. \\nOnly minor complaint would be that extended checkout is only 30 minutes, which doesn't make much of a difference. \\nOverall we had a great stay, very comfortable, clean and relaxing environment.  \\",
            "We stayed for two nights over the Easter long weekend and had a fabulous time. Very friendly staff. The concierge Steve stood out in particular - he is a true professional who paid special attention to ensure our kids had a great time! \\n\\nIt\\u2019s a beautiful modern hotel. We especially enjoyed the heated rooftop pool, spacious movie room with popcorn and drinks, access to the gym\\u002Ftennis\\u002Fracquetball, ping pong and basketball, and the kids play centre (small fee) that had sports, electronics, and arts. The concierge planned an Easter egg hunt for the kids which was a big hit! \\n\\nBreakfast was delicious! Next time we\\u2019ll take advantage of the Guerlain spa. I bought some perfumes which are exclusive and hard to find. The only downside was that the lounge was closed and the skybar is under renovations. It would have been nice to experience those amenities. But we had a fabulous time nonetheless and will be back",
            "My fiancee and I booked Hotel X as soon as lockdown was being lifted and it was the best decision we could have made. As someone who travels to countless of resorts for business - Hotel X truly reminded me of a destination resort. It was such an amazing escape from the day to day. The food, service and amenities are incomparable to other hotels in the city. Yuna & Matt went out of their way to make sure our stay was nothing less than perfect. We booked the pool with ease and had a great time at the rooftop pool. We had dinner at The Grill (you have to try to the flatbread!). It was such a great way to feel some normalcy during the pandemic and Hotel X made sure we felt safe and everything was always cleaned and sanitized. Our room had an incredible view and the comfiest bed. We can't wait to return next month -this is definitely now our go to staycation spot",
            "Stayed at this hotel in summer 2019.  Excellent service and amenities.  Location is also great for access to the Enercare Centre. Only recommendation is that guests be able to access the squash club during their stay",
            "Stayed here with our young kids for a staycation. Room (superior queen) was the perfect size and the view of the water and airport made the kids super happy. The in room amenities for the kids such as milk and desserts, balloons, stuffies and colouring pages were above and beyond to make their stay extra special. The kids play centre was great, well equipped with toys and video games, and the staff was very caring and attentive to the kids. The entire property was beautifully kept and well equipped with the pool, virtual golf, gym, etc. we didn\\u2019t use the gym much but it was probably one of the more impressive facilities I\\u2019ve seen anywhere. The pool was small (the indoor part; outdoor is much bigger) but the water was warm and we still enjoyed it. Service at the restaurant onsite was excellent, but I will note that it\\u2019s your only food option so there\\u2019s not a lot of variety. However, you can always order delivery so not a big deal. The concierges were always kind and helpful, and I will note that the manager Pranav went out of his way to help us book the room according to our needs, and ensure we had a good stay. The retro arcade room was really well done as well, we enjoyed using that. The rooms are very clean and everything is very up to date, I even noted the elevator buttons were self sanitizing! It\\u2019s 5 stars in terms of most aspects, not quite like the Ritz Carlton or ShangriLa, but this property was way more fun than those places and much better value. We would definitely stay again, and that\\u2019s really what matters",
            "Lovely property with very luxorious amneties. Absolutely beautiful view from our room on the 23rd floor.\\n\\nComplimentary soaps from the room had amazing fragrences and really made you feel like you were at a spa",
            "I just can't say enough good things about Hotel X Toronto. From the moment we arrived on Friday to the moment we left, it was a five star experience! \\n\\nI have been here a few times before and it has always been fabulous but with the staff shortages caused by Covid, I was ready to manage my expectations. (We went on a family vacation out west this year and ran into this everywhere - regardless of the type of hotel chain, high-end and not). Hotel X Toronto is an example of how it's done! \\n\\nWow, wow, wow! The most beautiful rooms (we splurged on a two bedroom suite for a girlfriend's birthday weekend); the great food and service at the X Lounge, the responsive and amazing front desk staff\\u002Froom service, etc. Our entire party also went to the Guerlain spa where every one of us had the best facial\\u002Fmassage we have every had. The gym in the hotel is also one of the nicest in the city! We only use the main equipment but there are all kinds of classes available too.\\n\\nThis hotel has a resort feel and is a tru oasis with killer views and an incredible rooftop pool. I am already planning my next stay",
            "Stayed two nights with a friend in a suite to attend a\\nbachelorette weekend. We specifically picked this\\nhotel to have a relaxing pool day Sunday at the end\\nof the weekend. \\n\\nCome to find out at check in amenities can not be used last check out (noon). Have been to several luxury resorts around the world and this is not consistent with those experiences. Have always been able to use the amenities after check out. Further, you may only book for a two hour window. Fine. They allow us to book the llam-1:00pm window. They inform us only guests on the reservation may use the pool, so we added the bride (who lives in Toronto) to the reservation for the Saturday night so she could join us by the pool Sunday. The hotel charged us $50 for this. We arrive promptly at 1lam for our two hour scheduled visit Sunday and there is not a single lounger for us to use. The bride needs an even tan for her wedding next weekend and had to lay towels on the ground to tan her back. See pictures for the kind of luxury pool experience you can expect at hotel X. How disappointing. Would\\nhave chosen a different hotel had we known all of\\nthe stipulations and complications of using the\\nrooftop pool. Even if you follow all the rules you'll still\\nend up tanning on the ground. There is a plethora of\\nspace up there the hotel should invest in 50 more\\nloungers and get ride of all the chairs",
            "We chose to stay here based on a friend's recommendation, and the service, amenities, food, views, and value were outstanding! We were in a junior suite, which was spacious, came with everything you could possibly need (robe, slippers, umbrella, etc), was absolutely silent on a Saturday\\u002FSunday night, and included access to the Library Lounge. We paid for breakfast at Maxx's on our first morning, and utilized the complimentary breakfast in the lounge on our second day. The staff were terrific, room service was great, all of the bars had great city views, the art gallery on the lower level was gorgeous, and the rooftop pool even has an accessibility chair to lower people into the water. They have truly thought of everything. It was too cold to enjoy the wraparound balcony but we look forward to coming back in better weather",
            "If you want a firm mattress, you must request it.  There is no guarantee you will get one unless you request one.   The wifi is not secure.  The roof top restaurant was chaotic.  The floor in the other restaurant was filthy.  Some staff are excellent, very friendly and do their best to serve you, and accommodate you.  Service can be very poor though.   I do not think this hotel is worthy of 5 stars.  It does not matter if you made reservations months in advance at Valerie, you still may not get a table.  For 5 stars the windows should be 3 pane.  Sure it\\u2019s in a very noisy area, but more could have been done for sound proofing.  It is a very busy hotel, too much going on.  Operating the cooling system in the rooms is challenging.  The water pressure in the shower is fantastic.  Adjusting the water temperature in the wash basins is also challenging.  Take care not to burn yourself.   The gym is fantastic.   I didn\\u2019t use the spa.  I also didn\\u2019t order room service.  The worst was my first night dealing with the mattress, having to move rooms, and then being offered only 15% off for my first night.   Then I was told it was my fault because I did not request a firm mattress.  Unfortunately, I won\\u2019t be staying there again which is disappointing because some of the staff are excellent and depending on what I am doing in Toronto the location is perfect.  The location is great if you want easy access to Etobicoke, for example.   The food can also be quite good",
            "We had the best time :) The hotel and amenities are amazing. Everyone who works at the hotel is friendly and professional. Two random things: the shower has tremendous water pressure!!! and the ventilation system in the room is completely silent, for those who hate that type of noise. We would definitely stay again",
            "This is a phenomenal hotel and my preferred hotel whenever I visit Toronto. The second you walk in, you are greeted by a very clean signature scent and a breathtaking live wall. The service at the front desk is unmatched. The rooms are large, clean, modern and super comfortable. There are multiple restaurants available in house, which is very helpful in Toronto winters where you might not want to venture outside. The additional amenities (pool, golf, racquetball, Pilates studio and more) allow for team building activities and self care options when staying. Overall an amazing property.",
            "Honestly I had high hopes for Hotel X. From the outside looking in, 5 stars seems fitting. As a first time guest, i\\u2019ll tell you why I wouldn\\u2019t bother to stay here again. The actual rooms in the hotel favor a Marriott. No personality or character.  Food was a headache because there\\u2019s one restaurant with a mediocre selection and a cafe that closes whenever it wants. There was so many events happening during my stay it just felt like one big party from my room and i didn\\u2019t enjoy that. The staff was nice though. The gym isn\\u2019t the hotels gym but you can still use it and it\\u2019s designed to satisfy tennis players. You have to rent racquets if you wanna play on the court which is an additional charge. All the amenities from the theatre, to golf is going to cost you and is not included with what you paid. I\\u2019ve stayed in many hotels in toronto , this might not even crack my top 10.",
            "This hotel is nice to look at, but unfortunately for me the service and actual comfort is lacking. Very superficial type of place. \\n\\nFor the price you pay, you should expect world class customer service; this doesn\\u2019t exist. We had a loud neighbour the first night partying until 4am. Made several calls to the front desk and not a single one was answered. Had no choice but to just stay awake and listen to the party all night. \\n\\nBeds are also extremely stiff and uncomfortable. Feel like cheap box springs. \\n\\nRooms controls are confusing, specifically the light switches. Need a PHD to figure out how to turn the lights on. \\n\\nCafe opened late every morning so wasn\\u2019t able to get anything besides a $50 room service breakfast every day. \\n\\nOnly nice thing was the washrooms\\u002Fshower. They did a great job with that",
            "Words cannot describe my stay at this downtown luxury. Me and my wife stayed overnight to give us a retreat from the city while we are currently under the \\\"grey\\\" zone\\n\\nThe view was spectacular and the breakfast was the best I ever had from any Hotels I have visited.  \\n\\nThe Guerlain Spa was def worth the price, shouts out to Julie! \\n\\nThanks Hotel X, especially Steven and Carlos for their warm and friendly manners during our stay \\n\\nWill visit again the future",
            "Our check and check out were seamless.  The staff is unbelievable and so pleasant. It took a couple tries to get through to room service. I heard that from a few people.  The lights are bit complicated but once you figure them out no problem.  We were escorted to our room with our bags but the bellman did not go over the room ammenities and how the lights worked.  The rooms were well laid out but some of the furniture was showing its age. The beds were comfortable.  The hotel is beautiful has great views and tons to offer from gym facilities to tennis courts and a spa.  The location is not really accessible for walking or sightseeing you definitely need a car or ride share.  I am rating this hotel based on the staff and amenities. I think the rooms are completely over priced for what you get. You could stay and many other high end hotels for the same money that offer more in terms of locations and luxury.",
            "Attended a work related conference at Hotel X.  Room was spacious, well appointed with amenities, very clean and had two very comfortable queen beds. My adult also travelled with me to the hotel, and when asked they were more than accommodating with a later check out for him and they also have a excellent departure lounge which made his wait for me to finish at 5:00 pm much more pleasent.  The hotel is very accessible by car and you have the choice of either valet or self parking which is not always available at a hotel of this level in Toronto.  Overall I highly recommend Hotel X and would definitely choose to stay here on my next trip to Toronto",
            "Valet and front desk were pleasant and efficient. Although I would have liked to book restaurant reservations at the time of check in but they could not accommodate on their end.  The room was average at best. Lacking amenities and cheap furnishings and materials\\u2026 this place is already starting to look and feel a bit outdated. No snacks or minibar offerings. The carpet felt disgusting and had multiple waves in it. The bed was not very comfy and they have some plastic mattress cover on that made a creaking noise every time you move. Big no-no is the \\u201Cblackout\\u201D blinds didn\\u2019t black the window out and let plenty of natural light in. Lastly, the late night rom service was appreciated and efficient but kept me on the toilet a few hours later. Given, the location for going to a concert at the Budweiser Stage was ideal, but For the price paid, I\\u2019d rather have stayed a $20 Uber away and stayed in a more thoughtful hotel with further attention to detail",
            "I live in Toronto and selected this hotel to host a group weekend to celebrate an upcoming wedding. \\nI met 7 out-of-town guests on Friday. From the moment we pulled up until we checked out, the staff was authentically courteous. \\nThe hotel exceeded my expectations from the website and online photos. \\nWe used a number of the amenities during our 2 night stay. \\nHot yoga, gym equipment, pool and steam rooms were enjoyed the first day. The pool is partially indoors with access (swim under the glass divider) to the outdoor pool. It is fully heated and we swam outside during the snowstorm!  The indoor pool is very limited for space. Most of the pool space is outdoor.  \\nWe had the package that included 4:30 wine and cheese as well as the continental breakfast. Both services were superb. \\nWith our own curiosity tour, we saw the multiple squash courts, the 10XTO fitness facilities and dined in Maxx's restaurant. All amenities impressed everyone in our group. \\nWe had free self parking and it was very easy and hassle free access to the hotel elevator. \\nEvery employee, no matter what part of the hotel you were in, had a smile and were eager to help however needed. \\nYou can certainly come here and have no reason to leave if you're looking for a getaway to chill and treat yourself. \\nI live 15 min away and plan to book family Staycations in the near future.",
            "We had the most incredible girls weekend at Hotel X!  From the moment we checked in, we felt like royalty.  We stayed in the a corner suite with the most amazing views from all directions.  The living room style set up was perfect for lounging, relaxing and having a great catch up with friends.\\n\\nOur room had an incredible bathroom with a large soaker tub.  The water pressure in the stand up shower was incredible (always a bonus).  Just off of the washroom was a beautiful little vanity complete with cosmetic mirror and lights.\\n\\nThe concierge Stephen was AMAZING and so helpful in helping us select our restaurant for the evening.  As we were celebrating birthdays he also arranged for a beautiful surprise bottle of Rose to be sent up to our room.\\n\\nAfter a night on the town, we returned to our room and had the most incredible sleep!  Housekeeping had set up our pull out bed and the turndown service was lovely.  I have to say that the beds and bedding at Hotel X are top notch.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning we visited 10XTO, the beautiful luxury athletic club attached to the Hotel.  My girlfriend and I went to a Pilates reformer class with Joanna.  She was an amazing instructor and delivered an awesome class.\\n\\nFollowing our workout, we went to the Sky Bar for Lunch and took in the last moments of the breathtaking view.  We ordered one of each the Asian inspired appetizers (all delicious).\\n\\nIf you are looking for a 5 star experience for your next girls get away, Hotel X is the place to be.  We will absolutely be back!",
            "Hotel X is a dreamy, well designed hotel with excellent amenities. I fell in love with the design and decor of the public spaces of the hotel. My room was large, well appointed and had many great features: robes & slippers, Nespresso machine, automatic black out blind, good lighting, ample plugs and USB ports, an ultra comfortable bed and a nice sunset view. \\n\\nThe 24\\u002F7 fitness centre can\\u2019t be beat. I love that I was able to sign up for a hot yoga class too (additional charge).\\n\\nI liked the lake view. I didn\\u2019t try the restaurants but liked the Nespresso cafe and appreciated the convenience of the attached Starbucks. \\n\\nI stayed at this hotel for work while attending a conference at the beanfield centre so the location was unbeatable. I would definitely stay in this hotel again, especially if I don\\u2019t have a need to be right downtown. It\\u2019s worth nothing it\\u2019s a close walk to the island airport (and they have a free shuttle) for added convenience",
            "I basically chose this hotel at such an off-centre location because it had a full gym with fitness centre, yoga classes, steam room and even tennis courts! However, surprise, surprise, steam room is only accessible to gym members. And, not surprisingly, yoga classes cost 25$ each and 47$ for the tennis courts. In the end, I simply used the fitness centre without being able to relax after my activities in the steam room. \\nThere are also steam rooms at the adjacent Guerlain spa but at the hefty price of 280$ for a 90-minute massage that is not even done by a regular massage therapist, so they won\\u2019t be giving receipts. Won\\u2019t be coming back. It is just not worthwhile"

The hotel is minutes from Pearson Airport and you can jump on the highway and go anywhere.  The hotel staff were absolutely amazing and super-responsive!  They were so good, in fact, that we impromptu extended our stay by a night and hit up Canada's Wonderland the next day!  Would recommend",

I will certainly stay at this hotel the next time I am flying through Pearsons int'l",
            "Love that the room I was in was lino instead of carpet. The Indian dish from the attached restaurant with the homemade chili sauce was excellent. The hallways above ground floor are a little scary because they are dark and the air system is loud. Mixed feelings about the pool and spa area . Enjoyed having it to myself ( you have to book ahead)  but do not use the wet spa. I turned it on and a LOUD high pitch buzzing came out of it and stayed on the ENTIRE 45 min I was there. Just use the dry spa. Much quieter and more enjoyable. The hot tub was tepid. The guy who drove the shuttle at 530 in the morning was super rude to me which I didn't understand as I was feeling happy and grateful. Oh well. I was even more happy and grateful after I was away from him so I'll call it a win. Overall I was really happy with the hotel even with some of the negatives. The people working the desk were all very friendly. I'd stay there again",
            "The front desk check in, cleanliness, location, sleep quality and quality of the room were excellent as expected from Best Western brand. Where it differed was in value. Price per night was at high end compared to other hotels and offered far less amenities. \\n\\nNote that every Best Western is independently owned and operated. This particular location does not offer any continental breakfast and charges $3 for a very small cup of coffee in the lobby. There is limited parking and no outdoor parking if you have a larger vehicle. We chose this location for the Stay, Park & Fly package but they could not accommodate our vehicle.\\n\\nTatiana the front desk person was able to quickly locate an alternative parking for us to try at the regular Airport Park & Fly lot and arranged for us to get a shuttle back to the hotel via the airport once we parked there.\\n\\nIt did not appear that the gym or pool were available either but even if they were by the time we got the parking sorted out it was quite late and we had to be awake at 5 a.m. the next morning.\\n\\nIf you don't have a larger vehicle and don't need any amenities this is a great place to stay. Only because the price we paid for the night was high and the amenities low I am rating VALUE as low on this chart.

Considering the price I paid, I wasnt really sure what to expect for a room. Yet when i checked in, I was greeted with a nice, big king sized room, fridge and microwave which was helpful for my long stay. The bathroom was alrger than what i expect from hotel bathrooms, ans the open half glass wall shower made showering breathable (as someone who overheats easily). The internet was surprisingly fast and all of the staff I saw during my stay was amazing. I ordered from the restaurant once, and the server on that night was just as friendly and helpful. \\n\\nI have never had such a good stay in a hotel before. Thank you thank you thank you for such a wonderful stay! I look forward to my next trip to Toronto. I'll be looking to book here first",
            "It\\u2019s an ok hotel. There are better close by. I was here on business, the staff were friendly for the most part. As my employer was paying for the hotel costs, I did not have much of an option. They tried to get me to give them my personal credit card for the security deposit. I explained that they had a card on file and they could use that for the deposit. After some discussion they figured it out and I went on my way. There were a few families living at the hotel and although they were noisy in the early evening but by 9 pm quieted down. Due to Covid protocols there was no room service, but I could call to the front desk if I needed anything.\\nEveryone was friendly including the 2 security guards working the front lobby.\\nThe room was clean, except for the coffee maker, which I decided not to use as it looked like it had seen better days. The refrigerator worked well and kept my stuff cold. \\nWhen I checked in they told me the restaurant would be open for breakfast, but I did not use the restaurant for any meals.\\nOverall it\\u2019s not bad, I have stayed in worse hotels.

Internet and tv were down for the majority of the time is a major disruption when you\\u2019re travelling for business and need to connect. The restaurant is handy but overall you\\u2019d be better off elsewhere.\\nDon\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll choose this property again",
            "This lovely hotel is close to the airport and has everything you need to make your stay and enjoyable one. The rooms a clean and spacious. The Staff are kind and helpful. The Flight Path restaurant serves delicious meals from incredible servers. The pool and fitness areas a clean and have great hours. There's covered (paid) parking (great for Canadian winters) and a shuttle to the airport (free) should you need it. Great stay - we highly recommend it...plus, the price was just right!.",
            "We stayed here so I could drop my wife off at the airport. Literally a five minute drive. Room was great. Restaurant was cozy and had great service, great food and good value. Parking is limited and you have to pay extra for it.",
            "The price was crazy of course, but a better value than the other hotels on the list.  The beds were comfortable and the staff was super helpful answering calls and helping out when they could.  Food was delivered cold and the air a bit stale with no windows that open, but I certainly felt welcome and not like a hostage",
            "We have stayed here 3 times in 2020. We stay here every year as you can get your room, 1 to 2 weeks covered parking while you are away. They have a shuttle that takes you to and from the airport. They also have a restaurant on site which is only average but you can park your car, check in to your room and then go down with out having to go outside and eat. Makes every thing so much simply",
            "The hotel was very clean and the amenities provided in the bathroom were well thought about.  The food was not superior in any way. The staff was very accommodating and pleasant. The rooms are made up every second day which I would have appreciated being made aware of.  Some people might be annoyed at the constant aircraft flying directly overhead but I found the sound proofing of the room excellent.",
            "After travelling many years, this hotel hit the mark in all areas: helpfulness, check-in, cleanliness, restaurant, location (for my needs) and exceptional staff.  The two gentlemen at reception were outstanding. They were patient, informative and had a sense of humour. I would highly recommend this hotel",
            "Best Western is very close to airport. Staff were very courteous. Hotel was very clean. Room was clean, roomy & bed comfortable. We ate at hotel eatery hostess was very nice and food was good. Airport shuttle is available",
            "Stayed at the Best Western Premier for one night before an early morning flight at yyz. Booked \\nA room with 2 queen beds and the price was good for 3 people. Clean, fast and friendly service and close to YYZ. Tips when booking this hotel included close to Parknfly, close to Airzona bar and grill with good food at good prices and if you like plane spotting this hotel is for you. Overall the property is quiet, clean and the staff were excellent. Will be back",
            "This is a great place to stay when you need to be near Pearson. I booked mainly for the free airport shuttle (takes 5 minutes to get to the terminal) and the economical room rate. I was happy with the room - nicely updated with a really comfy bed and great walk-in shower. Restaurant was closed for supper but there are options just down the street. Staff were friendly and helpful. Breakfast in the restaurant was fast, tasty and not overpriced. This hotel does what it's supposed to do, and does it well.",
            "Staff was especially welcoming and friendly. Our room was clean and dog friendly.\\n\\nBut we caught this hotel at a bad time. There were two elevators for guests but one was not working when we arrived. Then the second one failed as well. The security people in the lobby helped guests to find the service elevator to go up but any guest on the fifth floor who had baggage and a child was left wondering how to go down. Signs would have helped them. \\n\\nThe HVAC in our room did not work and neither did our coffee maker. Coffee in the lobby cost $3\\u002Fcup.\\n\\nDespite being next to the airport rooms seemed well soundproofed",
            "The staff is pleasant and helpful at this location.  Shuttle driver is helpful with bags and safe drive.  The cost is a bit high, but location is convenient near the airport and parking available reasonabl",
            "We like to stay close to YYZ for our flights and as we had an early morning flight this was perfect. We stay the night before our flight and this was the first time we stayed at this property. We booked on Expedia and paid $ 207.99 taxes in with our CAA membership. The property was clean and modern and was close to3 or 4 places to eat within walking distance and within the hotel itself. It had a pool and fitness centre and for those who like plane watching you can\\u2019t get any better. What stood out about this hotel was the customer service. From entering the property to checkout the staff was excellent. We will book this hotel again and would recommend it highly",
            "Excellent stopover going and coming from a trip.  Covered garage is a plus.  Front desk are so friendly, laid back and helpful.  Restaurant is simple, has great food and staff are also very friendly.  Rooms have been updated, are very clean and bed and pillows ate so comfortable.  Rooms have fridge, microwave and coffee maker.  We have been here before and will return again.  Join the Best Western Reward Club, get points to put towards a free stay but be sure to quote your rewards number when making your reservation.  FYI..your charge on credit card may be $50 more than your actisl bill but that is a hold charge that will be credited back to your card within a few days later.  I would suggest they tell you that up front so you understand that when your card is charged.\\nShuttle is prompt and courteous.\\n\\",
            "It was a very pleasant stay. Check in staff very friendly and helpful! Rooms were very clean and updated \\nVery convenient having the fridge , microwave and mini coffee machine.\\nI have one suggestion that is it would be great if you offered bottled water to guest on arrival",
            "Staying during mandatory hotel quarantine. Loved having a microwave and fridge available to me. All other amenities were good, bed, bathroom ect. Food quality was mediocre but plentiful.  Would have been nice to be given a choice between meals (the meat and vegetarian option for example)",
            "I love this hotel. Perfect rooms, prefect parking. Everything is amazing when you stay in this hotel close to Pearson airport. They offer 15 days parking package for traveling. Rooms are well decorated, modern and clean. Breakfast and amenities better than any other hotel in the area.",
            "This was in a strange location without a car, really nothing around. The room was very nice in a very new hotel, very comfy. The pool area was ok with a nice small gym as well. One disappointment was no breakfast like we traditionally are used o at most best westerns",
            "Stayed here on two occasions, both for an overnight layover. For needing a place to eat, shower and sleep it is a nice option. \\n\\nRooms, specifically the showers, could get a better cleaning but overall it was good. \\n\\nShuttle service was fast and very convenient.",
            "Prior to making my reservation I called the hotel to enquire about a late check out. I was told to ask upon check in. Which I did, which was promptly refused. I had booked the hotel specifically for this reason, having a late flight the next day, so I was not happy at all.\\n\\nThe room was fine, although I question the need to make guests pay for using the safe.\\n\\nThe shower needs looking at, the spray goes all over the place. An easy fix, but obviously overlooked by housekeeping.\\n\\nThere is no power outlet next to the bed, to the extend that the alarm provided by the hotel is not plugged in.\\n\\nUpon check-out (at 12, since I could have the late check out) I was charged for parking. While I understand this to be normal practice, I feel guests should be made aware - on the website as well as during check in.\\n\\nI was able to leave my bags at the hotel (no charge this time), I appreciate this.\\nOverall, the staff was friendly",
            "The staff are lovely at the hotel and extremely helpful.  The room was clean and basic. It is right on a flight path, but the noise is not noticeable at night. \\nParking is covered so problematic if you drive a larger vehicle such as a pick-up truck. No other options nearby to park. \\nThe restaurant is good and their staff helpful but has limited choices. This makes it difficult for those who have food restrictions. \\nThe Internet is slow, and TV is a little baffling regarding figuring out channels but that could be me not figuring it out properly. \\nIt is a pleasant hotel with courteous staff. Very responsive to communications as well.",
            "Unforunately, the interior decorator did not know the concept of visual editing and and uses way to many contrast colours, bold designs and bright lights that can not be turned off. The small room had a super bright night light and microwave which made the bright room impossible to fall asleep, thus leading to sleep deprivation before my intercontinental portion of my trip. There were so many contrasting colours and bood shape designs in such a small room that the interior design was a painful to look at. There were not enough pillow in the room adding to the sleeplessness and discomfort. The room would benefit from using less contrasting colours inconjunction with a more neutral and calming palette. The shuttle taxi from the airport was lack luster and a little rude, as they refused other hotel guests in favour of only taking on couple at a time instead of filling more seats in cold weather.\\n\\",
            "Nice hotel. Stayed here for 1 night after arriving at midnight form a flight. Just 7 min away from the airport. There is a shuttle service running every 30 min during the morning and every 1 hour during the evening. I believe that they should maintain a 30 min frequency all day long, as I had an evening flight and had to wait almost an hour for the next van to leave. Rooms are big and wifi service is quite fast. My room was clean as well as all the hotel common areas",
            "Very clean room, excellent service in restaurant.  Covered Parking. Great for against the elements. One of the closest to the airport for a park, fly, stay scenario. You can stay either at the beginning or end of your trip. Shuttle to the airport is included",
            "I like this location because it is close ( 1 block)  to an Enterprise car rental that is outside the airport. That way I can save hundreds on picking up a rental car. I fly in to Toronto , take the hotel shuttle over and then walk up to the Enterpise. If you arrive late there are 2 restaurants 2-3 blocks from the hotel, that are open til after 12am",
            "A lot of partying going on. Just needed a place to sleep near the airport in between flights. Sleep was minimal, doors slamming all night, loud guests. Vomit outside the exit doors, could have been much cleaner. Definitely won\\u2019t stay there again if I plan on actually sleeping",
            "Hotel is close to Airport, morning staff were friendly.\\nRestaurant at this hotel had a good selection.\\nMeeting room was comfortable and nicely laid out.\\nCoffee in the lobby cost $2.00, and nice selection of snacks available at the front desk",
            "Clean, modern and welcoming hotel; great stay, park and fly packages.  Free shuttle to and from airport.  Covered parking lot!  No snow to shovel off when arriving home from winter break. Fabulous amenities. Staff is excellent and very welcoming.",
            "Stayed here for 2 nights unexpectedly because my flight home was delayed. Very happy I randomly chose this place - I wanted something budget friendly and didn\\u2019t need extra frills or anything. All the staff I spoke to were friendly and helpful, restaurant\\u2019s food was good, beds were comfy, room was clean. No complaints! I\\u2019d stay here again. The airport shuttle every 30 mins was very convenient too.",
            "I was surprised and disappointed at the poor service from the staff and the poor cleanliness of the room, having stayed at hotels near airports quite a few times before around the world. Please note that there are 3 different airport hotels, and they do have a business card at the front desk which clarifies the locations for the shuttles! I really would have liked not to have problems, considering I had an early start the morning after my first night - I didn't get breakfast vouchers until I asked for them, although I paid the breakfast rate, and didn't learn about them and what's included until I overheard from other diners in the restaurant. Please bear in mind that there will be loud banging of doors and talking outside your room at all hours of the night",
            "This hotel is not the most chic but it is very clean and mere minutes from the airport. I live two hours from the airport and loathe the idea of delving into airport traffic. Travelling is hectic enough! This hotel offers a one night stay rate with $10\\u002Fday parking for your trip and a free shuttle that keeps you out of the airport melee. It is really a great solution and the staff are helpful, solicitous and courteous",
            "I stayed here for business travel during COVID-19, during an extended overnight flight layover and it did the job. The hotel was clean, check-in was quick and it's less than a 5 minute \\u00DCber ride from Terminal 3. My room faced the airport which meant I could hear the low rumble of aircraft taking off during the night but it wasn't that bad that it bothered me.\\n\\nThere are two things I base a hotel recommendation on; a comfortable bed and a nice shower with excellent water pressure, and this hotel had both of those. The TV was also wall mounted and larger than most hotel room TV's, which I appreciated. The coffee maker used the pod system, so if you are staying here for an extended period, you could use your own pods or a refillable one. The coffee was quite good, but I can't remember the brand they use.\\n\\nDue to COVID, all their other services and ammenities like the free breakfast and the gym, were closed, so I'm unable to comment on any of those. I would stay here again without hesitation",
            "I stayed in room 319, and while the decor was a tiny bit dated, the bed was very comfortable, the black-out curtains were amazing, and the staff and restaurant really made this stay very enjoyable.  I appreciated the fact that the lady at the desk helped me with my luggage, given that i use a mobility aid, and had been struggling a little bit.  Oh, and the room i was in was an accessible one, with the roll-in shower, and accessibility bars, etc.  I was right around the corner from the vending machine, so that was a great perk as well.  The room appeared to be relatively soundproof, and I barely heard the planes, so my sleep was quite restful",
            "Decently priced and close to the airport which is what we needed.  Thankfully they had a shuttle running early morning which was really convenient.  We had a domestic flight at 6:45am so we had to be at the airport by 5ish.  They had shuttles running even at 4am.  We got on the 5am shuttle which got us there in plenty of time for us to drop off our bags and catch our flight. Sleep wasn\\u2019t the greatest but that is likely due to anticipation of getting up on time.  The room temp could have been a better.  We had the ac running all night and found the room a bit stuffy\\u002Fhumid still.  Staff was lovely and friendly.",
            "Why is someone vacuuming right outside my door at 9:30pm? lol This hotel isn't bad. I didn't eat there, but there's a restaurant (looks kind of boring) called The Flight Path. That makes sense because this hotel is right under the flight path to the Toronto airport. So every 5 minutes a very loud plane goes by and sounds like it may land on me. I read other reviews before booking here that said it was so quiet and they couldn't hear a thing, but not my room haha. It could be worse though, could be trains instead of planes I guess. All in all, I'm happy. I feel comfortable. Staff is nice, room is clean. Pool and area is lackluster. There's a free shuttle that takes you directly to the airport, so we'll see how that goes in the morning :",
            "We booked here again, along with a friend because of the free parking and shuttle to the airport.  In addition, the rooms are clean, and they have a nice little restaurant on site.\\n\\nGood service, pleasant staff, and easy to get to.\\n\\nOh... and one of the most comfortable beds we\\u2019ve ever slept in",
            "This was a nice, clean hotel. Close to the airport, with shuttle service. Our room was spacious and included a King sized bed, walk-in shower, mini fridge, and microwave. We were a bit worried about our quality of sleep, being so close to the airport but we slept very well and didn\\u2019t notice the noise of the planes taking off\\u002Flanding. Our only issue was that both elevators weren\\u2019t working when we came in after dinner. There are no indoor staircases, which was odd. A staff member brought us up to our floor, using the staff elevator, so it wasn\\u2019t a big deal. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for anyone needing a place to stay, close to the airport. I should also add that the front desk staff were very friendly and welcoming",
            "Needed location near airport for early flight with free shuttle to same. Best Western is a reasonably priced brand I know I can trust.  I was very impressed with modern d\\u00E9cor of  room and bathroom  AND individual shampoo\\u002Fconditioner- so hard to find these days.  They really got it right with a shower cap and make-up remover towelette.  Bed was extremely comfortable.   The room and bathroom were  sparkling clean.  Keurig coffee machine was a nice touch.  Definitely recommend this hotel. Due to covid didn't use pool\\u002Ftub.",
            "The check in was efficient. Had to fill out a small form re the parked car. I was only in the room a scant 12 hours. Its colours are eclectic. My room overlooked the entrance area, catching the evening sun. The room temperature was set at a very pleasant 70F\\u002F21C. Had a large bed. It was, however, a poor sleep. Duvets and I just do not get along. Never tried the television. There was a closet which held a small safe, iron and ironing board. I did not use the microwave. The coffee maker was simple to use but the coffee itself rather weak. A little fridge could be found beneath the microwave. There were two comfortable chairs, one traditional, the other on wheels. Almost had to go downstairs re the wifi but it eventually connected and was fine thereafter. An ice bucket is another nice touch. The property is just five minutes from the airport. You pay a bit more for location [just over $212 Cdn included a parking fee]. It seemed rather busy but the floor was quiet. The bathroom was clean. I liked having actual toiletries. The shower was good. There were plenty of towels and a hair dryer. All in all, it is a nice property but I was not well rested before the flight"

            "Had a wonderful stay at the residence inn, service was good and the rooms are new. Perfect with kids, we were travelling with my 18 month old son and the room was spacious enough that he could walk around. The complimentary breakfast was very good with a lot of choices.... try the waffles.\\n\\nWe went to Canada's Wonderland which took us about 25-30 minutes to drive. And it is only 20-25 minutes from downtown.\\n\\nI would highly recommend this hotel, we paid 175$\\u002Fngt for a one-bedroom but some people on this site seem to have got better rates.\\",
            "Second time at this hotel for a hockey tournament and we'll be back next month too. Spacious rooms, some with full kitchens. Our two bedroom suite was ideal. The included breakfast leaves a  little to be desired but it got us fed before we left for the rink. Pool and outdoor basketball court help keep the kids amused. Many restaurants within a kilometre and access to the 401 is a minute away",
            "HAD stayed at this hotel multiple times in the past, always pleasant stays in the past, will never return.\\n\\nAs per previous reviews, management of this hotel has grown indifferent, cheap, and lazy.\\n\\nA myriad of small unpleast issues could have been shrugged off but not the final insult.\\n\\nFirst, an unpublished and unadvertised $8 per night charge to park in their badly lit unsupervised lot.  I can understand charging for parking at a prime location, or for extended use of the lot if you are flying out, but this was just a straight up 'extra cash' grab.\\n\\nSecond, the staff paid NO attention to detail.  The rooms were cleaned, but if you expected food at breakfast, good luck.  The hotel was busy and massively understaffed so that the small vessels at the breakfast buffet emptied rapidly and took forever to get refilled.  3 out of 4 morhings I had to wait around to get coffee, wait around for the juice to be refilled, wait for more bread, etc....  A 15 minute breakfast dragged into an hour waiting for food to be brought out.\\n\\nONE poor server trying to take care of the entire dining area; it wasn't her fault, but trying to cater to the number of guests they had with 1\\u002F3 of the required staff is a clear sign of bad, cheap management. \\n\\nThe pool never had towels.  I mean never.  We would ask at the desk, be told 'someone is coming', and a full hour later, still no towels. \\n\\nMy teenager asked for the code to get on to their lobby PC's.  They were told condescendingly that the terminals are \\\"not for children to use\\\".  Nice attitude, great customer service for a 'family' hotel.\\n\\nThe last straw was an issue with our furniture.  The night of our last stay we picked up the coffee table to move it away from the fold out sofa bed so our son could go to bed.  One corner of the table top came away in my hand.  The table top was a heavy marble and the table top separated right along the vein of the marble.\\n\\nAll of this was explained to the hotel, but they still charged my credit card for 'breaking' the furniture.  Speaking to me and scolding me like a small child for this was icing on the cake.\\n\\nI am going to fight the charges, but this is a sad case of a once pleasant and comfortable hotel with decent and caring staff going right down the toilet",
            "Due to weather we missed our connection and stranded in Toronto. Booked two nights on points.  The first morning I took shuttle to airport to try to go standby on flight. Able to get on.

Staff helped load all luggage (multiple suitcases & car seats) onto cart, brought down and quickly\\u002Fsafely got them to meet me at airport with ongoing communication. The hotel was fine but the staff, particularly Krista at front desk, is why we so highly recommend as everyone was most helpful and accommodating. Such wonderful service should be celebrated.

However today is my last day and I can't tell you how amazing this stay has been and how incredible the staff here are during my time here. I've never been at a hotel where every single staff member from every area of the business is so wonderful and nice and happy. They always smile and say hello whenever we cross paths and that means so much when you're staying alone. Jason at the front counter I'd unbelievably friendly, helpful, and kind. I absolutely hope he gets recognized for his amazing customer service. The rooms are spacious, I loved the kitchen with microwave, fridge, freezer, and utensils!

            "Used to stay at Stage West hotel but after having stayed once at the Marriott Residence Inn for business, it has become my preferred hotel in Mississauga. Here are some of the reasons:\\nVALUE:\\n\\u2022\\tFirst and foremost, great value for what you get. Last time I stayed there was with my wife and two sons and one girlfriend (my son\\u2019s, not me!) We stayed in one of the two bedroom suites, breakfast and a light super and free parking were included for a cost of $199.00 plus taxes! Below are listed some other benefits of staying there.\\nROOM:\\n\\u2022\\tHave stayed in both one and two bedroom, both very comfortable, fully equipped kitchen, separate bedrooms with TV\\n\\u2022\\tThe two bedroom has a fireplace and en-suite bathroom in each room. Great for two couples or family.  \\nAMENITIES:\\n\\u2022\\tBreakfast and light dinner provided, \\n\\u2022\\tSmall gym, pool and whirlpool. \\n\\u2022\\tSmall tuck shop with basics\\nLOCATION: \\n\\u2022\\t10 -15 minutes from Pearson Airport,  hotel has free shuttle\\n\\u2022\\tEasy access to highways, 401, 427, etc\\u2026..\\n\\u2022\\tWithin walking distance are numerous restaurants for all budgets, across the street there is a Boston Pizza, Jack Astor\\u2019s, Canyon Creek, Tuckers, if you walk a block or two there are several other chain restaurants\\nSERVICE:\\n\\u2022\\tCannot say enough about the exceptional service provided; especially by one of the front desk staff.  My son was flying in and was to meet us the Hotel. He failed to show up at the time we expected him, one of the front desk staff saw that we were still in the dining room long after everyone had left and came and ask if she could help. To make a long story short, she went out of her way to confirm my son had arrived in Toronto and then made arrangements to retrieve his lost luggage and get him to the hotel.  Wow!\\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\u2022\\tThis is not a full service hotel, there is no bar (there were beverages in the dining room that could be bought from the front desk). There is no restaurant other than breakfast room, but if you are looking for a very affordable, very comfortable accommodations particularly for a longer stay or with a larger group, you can\\u2019t go wrong staying there",
            "We booked a 4 night stay while attending the CGTA & Mode Show.  We had read about the hot buffet breakfast but weren't expecting too much, so we were pleasantly surprised to find such a selection.  The light supper provided from Monday to Thursday evenings was also delicious - we felt like we were at an all-inclusive.  Suite was lovely, staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, couldn't ask for anything more",
            "We love this hotel, very spacious, nice pictures and bathroom deco.  The view of the landing aircrafts is also a nice plus for couples who have young kids.  Highly recommend it. (not bad for someone who is very picky, along with picky family members who usually find reasons to disagree with my hotel choices :)\\n\\nIf you need to order Chinese food, Gourmet Express can deliver to the room, great food at very reasonable prices.\\",

The rooms were a good size and everything was very clean.  We used the high speed internet and had no issues at all with it, it was nice and speedy and very easy to connect up.  The breakfast in the morning also good, they had a very good variety available.  \\n\\nWe would stay at this hotel again without any problems",

As one who uses his Marriott rewards and typically only stays at Marriott properties, I was rather disappointed. \\n\\nUpon arrival looks very old and tired.  Hallways and entrance are small. Room is small. One bedroom King bed. \\n\\nFront staff often were busy doing something out of sight from the front desk.  My request on my mobile app was not done.  Too late at night so I did without. \\n\\nSleep was okay.  Room was clean. Something I\\u2019d expect from a category 1 or 2 hotel from Marriott and not a category 4. \\n\\nNext time it\\u2019ll be the Airport Marriott or the Courtyard Airport.",

Notre suite 2 chambres et sofa bed \\u00E9tait tr\\u00E8s spacieuse et \\u00E9tait \\u00E9quip\\u00E9e d'une grande cuisine et de deux salles de bains. La literie est tr\\u00E8s confortable. Le petit-d\\u00E9jeuner est compris et tout \\u00E0 fait correct. Le seul point n\\u00E9gatif est le manque de place par rapport au nombre de chambres. L'accueil \\u00E9tait pro et agr\\u00E9able. Il y a une piscine int\\u00E9rieure et un terrain de basket ext\\u00E9rieur. Il existe un shuttle gratuit vers l'a\\u00E9roport. Je recommande sans h\\u00E9siter. Bon rapport qualit\\u00E9\\u002Fprix",
            "The rooms were nice and open but the furniture is outdated. I thought the price was good. We got a 2 bedroom suite for 152 bucks for one night however on the receipt there was 3 separate charges for HST and another charge for 5 bucks which was ridiculous, in addition they charge 10 bucks for parking! so the room ended up costing 190 bucks! Thats a little outrageous. The eating area for the included breakfast is very tiny so be prepared to take your food to your room oh and its only available between 6:30am and 9:30am which is STUPID for a saturday. Its close to the airport so expect alot of travelers at the hotel it wasn't quite by any means. A suggestion to the hotel take that 10 parking fee you rip your customers off for and put it into a fund to level out your parking lot its horrible literally! One more thing id like to mention is that this is a residence inn therefor people are usually staying for an extended period of time so its a good idea to have sufficient utensils. Only provided one tiny steak knife! I did not find the staff accommodating, friendly or helpful in anyway. The lady that checked me in should maybe look for a job elsewhere because she was not warm in welcoming in anyway. I have stayed at many Marriott's and this is by far the biggest disappointment for a Marriott",
            "Very clean.  Nicely decorated.  Nice staff.  We got the last room supposedly.  Stopped in during a road trip.  Was advised by the AAA manual that this was a decent place to stay.  The price was originally 175.00 but reduced to 145.00 Canadian.  Serving party sandwiches for dinner that night-did not try but breakfast was a winner.  Lots of choices both hot and cold including sausage, eggs, toast, pastries, juice, coffee, etc.  Decent treadmill in the small exercise room.  My daughter loved the pool.  We enjoyed the basketball court outside.\\",
            "From the minute we arrived and my daughter was offered as many cookies as her small tummy could manage by the check-in clerk, the staff could not have been more helpful nor polite. We were arriving after a long flight from the UK, and were slightly pensive about how good\\u002Fbad the Residence Inn was going to turn out, given we only booked as our normal hotel we use in the Pearson airport area was full. Anyhow, the rooms are very new, clean and fitted out to a very high standard. The pool and fitness areas were also very neat and tidy, and there\\u2019s even an outdoor basketball court for those that still have some energy left after a long journey. High speed internet access and breakfast are also offered complimentary by the hotel, and on both counts the service provided was first class. We\\u2019ll definitely use the hotel again on future trips.\\",
            "This hotel really met my needs.  I was passing through Toronto meeting up with family before heading to Europe on vacation. We got a 2 bedroom, which had a pull out bed in the living room.  It was just what we needed. \\n\\nThe pool and hot tub are nice, and there was even a tennis court with a basketball net that was great for my nephews and niece. There are also complimentary computers for internet access near the lobby. \\n\\nIf you are looking to visit Toronto, this hotel is a bit far from areas of interest. It is close to the airport, offers a complimentary shuttle and parking is free. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. In fact, we liked it so much we booked there again for our return two weeks later",
            "We stayed only one night at the Residence Inn before our flight out to Vancouver the next morning. Our check in took a little longer than expected but the complimentary cookies at the front desk made up for it. The suite had a kitchenette, dining area, living area, desk and seperate bedroom. The hotel is fairly new so everything was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable with a lovely duvet and plush pillows. The complimentary breakfast and internet were a definate plus! Would definalty stay there again.\\",
            "The suite was spacious and the bed was extra comfortable.  We could watch the planes landing from our windows but we did not hear the planes at all.  The full kitchen was complete and included utensils, dishes, pots & pans.  The only thing missing was an oven.\\n\\nPopcorn was also provided.  Supper is complimentary from Monday thru Thurday and it consisted of soup + pizza on the Thurday we were there.  They also have fresh baked cookies in the lobby.\\n\\nat $101 cdn per night this was excellent value for the area.  many restaurants one block away and half an hour drive from downtown Toronto, it was perfect for us.\\",
            "Stayed here briefly before flying back West. This has great rooms, is just off the main hotel strip by Pearson Airport (YYZ) and the breakfast was not too shabby either. Very much recommended and I downloaded the Marriott app for my iPhone which made checking in and out a breeze",
            "I stayed in this hotel for two days . Firstly there is nothing around the hotel . Only few restaurants and nothing more to spend tiime. The closest shopping area is 10 minutes with taxi but you have to pay 25 dollars .\\nThe hotel room was nice especially for families with its kitchen equipment Bed is comfortable but when it comes to bathroom amenities and cleaniliness its lower then marriott standars. Especially there was a towel thorn from sides and I warned the front desk they said ohhh how can it happen but the other day it was still there . And after breakfast I warned front desk personally but until my stay finished the thorned towel was still there . \\nShortly It is a standard family hotel with no great luxury and with an avarage breakfast.And in the middle of nowhere . At the beginning it seems cheaper according to downtown hotels but i\\u015Ff you want to buy somthing or entertain you should pay a lot of taxi fares",
            "We stayed here while picking up a family member in the airport.  We used the 888 number to reserve and not the direct line to the hotel.  We reserved a king suite with a rollaway bed.  Upon arrival noticed it was not in the room.  The front desk informed us they don't even have rollaway beds and couldn't understand why we were told that.  We were offered extra linens which we took as one of us had to sleep on the floor.  The girls were up to their eyeballs with problems it seemed as it was caribana weekend and the hotel was full.  We stayed downtown before and while it is a nicer property, for the price and breakfast for 4 we were happy.  I think being a Marriott the communication around the sleeping should have not have happened and perhaps free parking could have been offered for the false info.  It. Was also not a king bed as advertised but again, the value was great!! If traveling with more than 2 it is a good hotel.",
            "This hotel is super nice. The building and the facilities are brand new. The room we stayed had a micro wave oven, dishwasher and utensils and complete dinner set for four. We never use them but they are there just in case you are the type who choose to cook your own food. The hotel will even do the goceries for you if you needed them. The staff are superb. I will not hesitate to recommend this hotel.\\",
            "Due to our plane being quite delayed, we missed our connecting flight and this is where we were housed until the next day when we could fly out.  There was a free shuttle but the driver was exceptionally rude when a girl in about her late teens\\u002Fearly twenties was struggling to get her bag up the stairs and he chose to answer his cell phone while watching her.  The drive from the airport was quite quick and check in was welcoming and friendly around 10:45 pm.  We booked a return to the airport on the 6:40 am shuttle.  We were given a $20 dinner voucher by the airline but there is no restaurant open.  Instead, we could choose from their \\\"Market\\\" which consisted of frozen, microwavable dinners, Kraft Dinner (microwavable), instant noodles, chips, pop, ice-cream.  After a long day of travel, this is not \\\"dinner\\\".  The hotel and hallways look very worn and tired with carpet ripped and stains.  When we opened the door to the room, the smell that wafted out was remnants of many different guest's cooked meals that have lingered for a long time.  It was definitely enough to make me gag, literally.  The place is very dated and the shower leaked.  The bed was comfortable and the hotel quiet throughout the night.  The next morning, we skipped the breakfast and attempted to catch the shuttle.  We found that they shuttle had left early and we missed it.  We were scolded by the front desk that the shuttle has a tight schedule to keep but we showed her the time and it was definitely before 6:40 am.  She called them and they returned to pick us up.  Never would I ever stay here or any where near this hotel chain again",
            "If you're going to Toronto and plan to visit places like Canada's Wonderland, the Toronto Zoo, Ontario Science Centre, and even downtown Toronto, I STRONGLY recommend the Residence Inn by Pearson Airport. In summary, the positives were great customer service, nice amenities, the room was luxurious, and the free hot breakfast buffet was as good or better than anything you would find at a restaurant! The only complaints I have are that there is no wireless internet (although there is a wired connection in room or lobby computers) and it would have been nice if the bathroom weren't only accessible through the bedroom (but that is a fairly minor gripe and didn't impact our stay at all). You will not find better service, quality, or value in Toronto!\\n\\nWe, two adults and a 9 yr old, stayed for three nights in July 2011, and will absolutely stay here again if we return to vacation in Toronto again. Our rate was $92 a night plus $8 for parking each night. However, when you factor in the free breakfast for three, the nightly cost goes from $100 to $75. The only other place you will find a price like that are the cheap motels where you don't get anywhere close to the quality offered at Residence Inn.\\n\\nThe location is great as you are just off of the 401 which you will use to get to most major attractions. It's tucked away and not on a busy street. It's by the airport so you will see airplanes, but I couldn't hear them and our room was at the end of the building facing the airport. The area is littered with restaurants! Moxies, Lonestar, Tony Romas, Montannas, Boston Pizza, and the Keg, just to name a few! There is a lacking in fast food and other retail, but having a great deal of choice when it came to dinner was a welcomed feature. \\n\\nThe hotel is well maintained and very clean. The basketball court was a nice plus; the swimming pool was medium sized but never felt crowded (and we went swimming at least once a day); the spa was nice because our kid could actually go in it (both the pool and spa were salt water, too); the parking lot was never crowded; there's an outdoor patio with BBQ for the guests to use; and I never found the halls to be noisy. There was always the latest newspapers available in the lobby, the staff posted a detailed weather forecast in the lobby, and two computers with a printer so that you could stay connected to the internet. The staff were beyond excellent - we showed up before noon and asked if there was any possibility to check-in early and were accommodated without any hesitation and the front desk even called us five minutes later to make sure the room was to our liking! The one time late in the day when we found no towels by the pool the staff quickly supplied some. In general it felt like the staff were genuinely fantastic at customer service. \\n\\nThe room was very spacious. My only complaint is that I wish the bathroom wasn't only accessible through the bedroom but that's minor. Internet is only available through a wired connection but there's computers in the lobby. The temperature in the room was so good that even with the air turned off and the outside temperature surpassing 30 degrees Celsius each day, we were still comfortable. The kitchen comes completely stocked with everything you need to cook and eat - including salt and pepper shakers! There was even a welcome basket with microwavable popcorn! The appliances worked and were by no means outdated. The under-mounted stainless steel sink was VERY deep. The bathroom was nice although if you like deep bath tubs you won't find one here. The sofa bed was comfortable - perhaps more comfortable as a pull out bed than as a couch. The TVs were nice and the one in the bedroom was close to the end of the bed which made it easier to read. There was plenty of storage space (two dressers and a large closet) and lots of seating - including a very nice desk chair and the two dining chairs, as well as an arm chair in the living room. The bedding was also comfortable although I must have been allergic to the pillow or comforter filling. There were at least three different pillow types available. Another nice bonus was an ice-maker in the freezer. Overall, it was an amazing room!\\n\\nThe final thing I wanted to mention was the breakfast... the free hot breakfast buffet easily covered the cost of parking and was as good as anything you will find at a restaurant! The selection was superb and changed slightly each day. While we were there the selection included waffles, french toast, sausage patties, sausage links, scrambled eggs, potato pancakes, beans in tomato sauce, four types of cereal, a variety of yogurt, muffins, donuts, bagels, english muffins, toast, cinnamon buns, fruit salad, fruit, oatmeal, and much more! There's also a good selection of beverages - orange juice, apple juice, cranberry juice, and grapefruit juice, tea, coffee, and milk. There was also every appropriate condiment you would expect - such as, but not all inclusive, powdered sugar, granola, chocolate chips, syrup, cream cheese, six types of jam\\u002Fspread, even cheeze wiz. Needless to say, the breakfast was not just filling, but allowed you to pick up some snack options for later as you had the option of using disposable containers and cutlery. To add to the great spread, it was well maintained and someone was always there to refill the available food or pick up any plates you were done with. It was never too busy that we couldn't find a seat, but then again if it were that busy you could always take it back to your room and eat at your own table. If you show up a little late the selection may not be as good as around 7 am, but the one day we did show up late we still ate like kings! \\n\\nI was beyond impressed by this hotel and it's nice to know that there's still good value to be found in Toronto",
            "In any given year I usually have several occasions to stay out by the Toronto Airport even though I live in the region....usually while attending conferences at the nearby Congress Center. In the past, my hotel of choice has always been the The Courtyard Marriott, and although it's not my favourite Courtyard, I am a strong supporter of the Marriott brand and that hotel has served my needs - however.......on this occasion the Courtyard was sold out and I ended up booking the Residence Inn - what a lucky break!!\\nThis hotel was a stand out from the moment I walked through the doors - the lobby exuded warmth & charm, the front desk staff were welcoming and cordial and the check-in process was easy. I had a one bedroom suite which included a sitting area, separate bedroom, comfortable work area, fully equipped kitchen with eating area, two flat screen TV'S , separate dressing area and nice bathroom. The room was spotlessly clean,  the bed super comfortable and the shower  divine with excellent water pressure. There is a small gathering room, complete with fireplace & T.V. in the lobby where they serve an included full breakfast every morning and evening snacks from Monday to Wednesday. There is also a small market stand where you can buy chips, snacks and frozen entrees for your room. The hotel will also do a grocery run, upon request, and charge to your room. If cooking in your room is not your style then there are a myriad of excellent restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. There is a nice sized indoor pool, basic workout room and outdoor basketball court. The only update that I think this hotel would benefit from would be the introduction of a small bar in the evenings - the one advantage that, in my mind, the Courtyard has over the Residence Inn. My recent stay was only for  three nights but I would have been perfectly happy to have stayed three weeks - I was that comfortable! This is my new \\\"go to\\\" hotel - paradise at Pearson",
            "Okay, so there were good and bad things about this hotel.  \\nThe GOOD.  \\n-staff was fantastic, from the cleaning ladies and maintenance guys up, everyone really went out of their way to make sure everything was okay.\\n-other guests, we met more than a few people at the hotel and everyone was very friendly, sometimes at the 'higher end' hotels people can be really snotty.\\n-the cleanliness.  I don't think I saw a speck of dirt.  And believe me, I look!  Corners of ceilings in the lobby to the claw feet on the tables in the hall, no dust.  Pretty impressive.\\nThe BAD.\\n-the room is smaller than you think it will be, it was adequate, but not what I expected.\\n-the sofabed...oh....my.  Seriously, if you love the people you travel with, you won't expect them to sleep on this hammock.  We padded it with the (hideous) coverlet and 3 blankets.  Didn't really help.  Also, the sheets they provide for it are see through.\\n-the blankets.  Before we realized that we'd need a blanket to pad the bed, we thought we'd need it to sleep.  Still not sure if they were made of velcro or sandpaper.  Had to go down and ask for the same blanket (duvet) that they put on the beds.  Luckily, I've already made my comment about great staff.\\n-pillows and bed.  How did they raise the floor like that?  Very hard.  Hard pillows?  Yes, both the feather and the foam.\\n\\nThe hotel has a VERY dated feel to it.  It reminds me of the 70's, when you'd travel with the whole family.  There's even a barbecue outside!  The pool is bromine, which is kind of a salt\\u002Fchlorine combo, it's okay, but pretty drying on the skin.  I expected the pool area to be full of kids, but it wasn't bad at all.  The gym is quite nicely equipped, pretty much all you need.  A wired free connection in the room for the laptop was really nice.  Driving distance to shopping\\u002Fgrocery.  The tuck shop (snacks and drinks) had a really nice selection that wasn't wildly overpriced like minibars can be.\\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't stay there again unless I got a fantastic deal like I did this time.  The space wasn't worth it as I prefer more sophisticated hotels.  I wasn't left with a bad impression, not at all, but the hotel itself wasn't memorable at all",
            "We recently stayed at the Residence Inn for a girls hockey tournament.  Normally three nights in a basic hotel room with 2 Adults, 2 Kids, 2 Sets of Hockey Equipment etc.  is crammed and not very pleasant.  The rooms at the Residence were like mini apartments!  There was a full kitchen, a living room with pull out sofa bed, and a separate bedroom (with a door that shuts which is great for privacy) and the bathroom off of the bedroom.  On Thursday evening they had a free supper which on that night was soup and salads, but the menu shows chili, shepherds pie etc.  It was really good.  The continental breakfast is a hot breakfast which is also very good.  Housekeeping came in every morning and filled the dishwasher, ran it and then emptied it the next day --- awesome!   Upon getting home from our trip I realized I had left my reading glasses on the desk.  I called housekeeping and they did find them and Fedex'd them to me within two days --- Thank Goodness!  Overall a great stay and definately will look for Residence Inn whereever we travel in the future",
            "I have been to a couple inns near the airport for some reason or another and this has been by far the best service I have received.  The staff was very friendly and helpful no matter the time. There is a full breakfast served included at the hotel and they change the types of food offered every day I was there.  There is no restaurant or bar in the hotel but there are plenty within walking distance and they even have a full grocery delivery service to the hotel so you can use the fridge, microwave, stove and dishwasher in your room if you'd prefer.\\n\\nThe planes from the airport can still be heard but they're much quieter here as it's not on the main path like other hotels nearby.  We were on the third floor and after 21:00 there were no problems with noise level.  During the day you could hear the planes go by but it wasn't very loud to begin with.  We were on the South side of the hotel which faces the air traffic more than the North side and we had no problems.\\n\\nThe hotel room itself was very clean and spacious.  This hotel does allow pets but there is a charge to sanitize the room afterwards and each of the rooms with an animal are clearly marked.\\n\\nOverall I would say this is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Toronto and it will be the one I book again any time I need a hotel near the airport.  Thank you for the great experience",
            "Have stayed here frequently most recently twice in December 2013. The rooms are clean and spacious. The staff are great. Always friendly and very helpful.\\nMy only two complaints:1. They now charge $10  for parking which used to be included. Many others in the airport area like the Hampton\\u002FHomewood Suites on Eglington do not charge. 2.The breakfast is generally quite good but ends at 9 (or 930 on  weekends) and  we often miss it if we sleep in",
            "Had a junior suite with 2 bedrooms and kitchenette. Very well stocked (fridge, ice, toaster, coffee maker etc.), clean and had everything we needed. Pool and hot tub were fine as was the unexpected social hour snack\\u002Fmeal. The complimentary breakfast was very well done, lots of hot and cold choices. But beyond all of that, the staff are the winners of this hotel. Well done and thank you",
            "Just 5 minutes from Toronto Airport (complimentary airport transfer if required),  this hotel did not disappoint.  We were 4 adults and had booked a 2 bedroomed suite. It was spacious, immaculately clean with new furnishings and state of the art tv's in both bedrooms and sitting room.  The sitting room has a log effect remote control fire for cosy winter evenings and a  well equiped  kitchen which looked as though it had never been used.  With 2 ensuite bedrooms this apartment on the 9th floor (top floor) could easily sleep 6.  The breakfast was buffet style with plenty of choice and  complimentary coffee and  tea (make it yourself)  was available allday from the sitting area. The two men in our party made the most of the free internet service and I enjoyed the indoor swimming pool. All-in-all, this has to be one of the best airport stopovers we have ever had. \\nJune 17th 2006.  Jan & Brendan Lomax & Ann & Gordon Milne,  London .UK.\\",
            "I just got back from Toronto for business and my company booked us at this hotel for \\n4 days. Great hotel! Everyday there was a free breakfast. The rooms had full size appliances in the kitchenette, had a living room with TV, separate bedroom with TV, a separate area off the bedroom with a large sink area, and a separate bathroom with toilet and shower. It looked to be just remodeled. It was one of the nicest rooms I have stayed at and also comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are travelling to Toronto. Pool, hot tub and exercise room also. The staff were very friendly and helpful",
            "Close to airport with a convienent free shuttle service.  There is a managers reception with ok food and a charge for beer wine.  A few close restaurants near by within walking distance of 1\\u002F2 mile.\\n\\nHotel staff was very friendly and attentative",
            "We always try to stay at Residence Inn when we are away from home for various reasons, which includes homely feeling, good breakfast in the morning and if needed ability to cook food. Toronto Airport Residence Inn is no different, its very nice place, very clean rooms, fully equipped gym, laundry facilities on 3 floors, good breakfast in the morning. Honestly I didnt find anything lagging anywhere. Only issue is, the place is bit far from downtown, but if you can put up with that, its fine. Since we had a car, we were ok. There is also free shuttle to the airport. There are restaurants in walking distance from the hotel so you dont need to drive. In all very pleasant stay, I also like seeing airplanes landing which was very nice. If you have issues with the very little noise of aircraft, then try to get a room on the other side of the building, but the noise for me is completely alright, its much subtle than other hotels I have stayed at. We will comeback, just dont know when. Keep up the good work",
            "Great staff. Great breakfast. Pet-friendly. Well equipped kitchen. Internet and power at the kitchen table.  Comfy couch and huge walk-in shower. Price on small snack items at convenience store levels.  I could move in and live happily. Special thanks to Frey and Elny for their warm and careful attention to my extreme Celiac sensitivities",
            "If you are traveling to Toronto and have to stay at the airport then this is the place for you. The service is great, the staff are friendly and welcoming and the rooms are clean. Let's face it, no one wants to go to TO and stay overnight at the airport. So why to go somewhere that you feel welcome and at home",
            "We reserved a 2-bedroom apartment for a long weekend for four adults and one child.  It was perfect with two bedrooms, each with a bathroom and a sleeper sofa in the separate living room.  The full kitchen with a table was well used and we prepared some meals.  The full-breakfast was one of the best complimentary we've had at a hotel.  The staff was always helpful and courteous.\\n\\nThe indoor pool and hot tub, were large and well maintained and the workout room while small was pretty good.\\n\\nThe hotel is near the airport so you have to drive a bit to the city but the airport shuttle was handy when arriving and leaving.  Overall, a great value for a clean and well maintained hotel",
            "I did some research on this hotel on this site, and heard it was new- 2 years old. \\nThe rooms - marble tile bathrooms, new pillow top beds, new carpeting, nice view.\\nBreakfast - complimentary - scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, all continental items, waffles, pancakes - all complimentary\\nService - everyone from the front desk, to the breakfast help to housekeeping is friendly and do a terrific job. \\nAl in all, I can't think of a better hotel experience. They also have a nice fitness center, and pool.\\nYou are right by the airport (2 miles), can see planes landing, but amazingly , cannot hear them at all inside the hotel.\\",
            "Arrived late after 10 pm. Very close to airport, didn't take long by taxi. We booked a two bedroom apartment. It had two washrooms, which was helpful. D\\u00E9cor was a bit dated but the  overall environment was homely. Quite good free breakfast",
            "Booked a last minute family trip for the weekend. Great hotel, wonderful full All-American breakfast included. Clean, modern, courteous staff. Wished they had free parking. Otherwise absolutely nothing to complain about. Kids were confortable in the two room suite which has full refridgerator, range, dishwasher, micowave and coffee pot. Noticed the night before check out that they also offer free grocery shopping. Grocery is billed to your room. Wish I noticed before, traveling with 3 young kids we would have certainly taken advantage of this. Also coin operated washing machines. The kids also enjoyed that the pool stayed open until 11pm. Perfect for relaxation at the end of our daily adventures",
            "Rooms are nice with full kitchen.  I had a one bedroom suite.  \\n\\nExercise room a was standard  and a indoor pool\\n\\nOutside seat great as we'll. \\n\\nHotel does have shuttle that runs on demand.  \\n\\nTried the airport shuttle.\\nIt was free and service was excellent.  \\n\\",

            "My family and I booked a 2 bedroom suite at this airport hotel and I was a little leery due to some of the negative reviews, but when we walked into our suite everyone went ...hmm nice... The fully equiped kitchen had granite countertops and ceramic tile floors as did the 2 bathroms in our suite. The beds were very comfortable and with 3 tvs in the suite we all watched what we wanted in complete comfort. At $230 per night for this luxury suite along with a hot breakfast made this a great value. The service was very sincere and friendly and we really could not have asked for more",
            "We had a 2 Room suite that was quite large. Had a king size bed, stove, desk ,dishwasher, pots, dishes and all the utensils you would need if you where here for a long term stay. Also had a full size fridge and 2 flat screen TVs. Breakfast and airport shuttle where included in the rate. You can call for the shuttle on arrival and for the return to the airport just make a reservation at the front desk. They have an arrangement for you to park your car when you go away on holidays. We arrived by plane so we did not use this service. the only  thing I did not like was the hotel does not have a restaurant or a bar. We had to walk to the hotel next door to have lunch. There are restaurants nearby but when we arrived Sunday night most had closed early. It was very quiet inside the hotel even with flight going overhead we heard nothing. Good soundproofing",

            "Lots of friendly and helpful staff.  Location was prefect for access to the Budweiser Stage and CNE.  There's a pool area on the top floor for views.  Expect a long line up for the elevator after the budweiser stage concert. The tricycle people carriers are parked on the sidewalk near the hotel.  They charge about $15 -$20 cash per person 1 way to the Budweiser Stage.  Since your in the heart of the action, expect traffic to be congested. Hotel X is amazing \\uD83D\\uDC4F \\uD83D\\uDE0D \\uD83D\\uDE4C",
            "Absolutely fantastic hotel that, although pricey, provides an overall experience that justifies the extra expense.  This hotel has the most spectactlar athletic facilities we have ever seen in a hotel and the rooftop pool is wonderful (thoughfully designed with a partition that allows both indoor and outdoor use during winter).  Breakfast (not included in the room rate) at Roses Cafe was very good and reasonably priced for the quality.  The nearest streetcar station (509 & 511) is a 5 minute walk and the location is great for events at the Coca-Cola Coliseum and Convention Centre.  Staff were responsive and helpful.  We will definitely stay here again when back in Toronto",
            "I wish this place still had the same panache as the last time. Aw well, on to the next eventually. I can see the cost rising is impacting what Hotel X can provide and what customers can pay. This is a stearn way of suggesting Vote Pollievre?",
            "Honestly I had high hopes for Hotel X. From the outside looking in, 5 stars seems fitting. As a first time guest, i\\u2019ll tell you why I wouldn\\u2019t bother to stay here again. The actual rooms in the hotel favor a Marriott. No personality or character.  Food was a headache because there\\u2019s one restaurant with a mediocre selection and a cafe that closes whenever it wants. There was so many events happening during my stay it just felt like one big party from my room and i didn\\u2019t enjoy that. The staff was nice though. The gym isn\\u2019t the hotels gym but you can still use it and it\\u2019s designed to satisfy tennis players. You have to rent racquets if you wanna play on the court which is an additional charge. All the amenities from the theatre, to golf is going to cost you and is not included with what you paid. I\\u2019ve stayed in many hotels in toronto , this might not even crack my top 10.",
            "I just can't say enough good things about Hotel X Toronto. From the moment we arrived on Friday to the moment we left, it was a five star experience! \\n\\nI have been here a few times before and it has always been fabulous but with the staff shortages caused by Covid, I was ready to manage my expectations. (We went on a family vacation out west this year and ran into this everywhere - regardless of the type of hotel chain, high-end and not). Hotel X Toronto is an example of how it's done! \\n\\nWow, wow, wow! The most beautiful rooms (we splurged on a two bedroom suite for a girlfriend's birthday weekend); the great food and service at the X Lounge, the responsive and amazing front desk staff\\u002Froom service, etc. Our entire party also went to the Guerlain spa where every one of us had the best facial\\u002Fmassage we have every had. The gym in the hotel is also one of the nicest in the city! We only use the main equipment but there are all kinds of classes available too.\\n\\nThis hotel has a resort feel and is a tru oasis with killer views and an incredible rooftop pool. I am already planning my next stay",
            "Attended a work related conference at Hotel X.  Room was spacious, well appointed with amenities, very clean and had two very comfortable queen beds. My adult also travelled with me to the hotel, and when asked they were more than accommodating with a later check out for him and they also have a excellent departure lounge which made his wait for me to finish at 5:00 pm much more pleasent.  The hotel is very accessible by car and you have the choice of either valet or self parking which is not always available at a hotel of this level in Toronto.  Overall I highly recommend Hotel X and would definitely choose to stay here on my next trip to Toronto",
            "We recently visited this establishment. I travelled with 10 of my close friends. We are all between the ages of 40 and 50 and we\\u2019re all very disappointed with the accommodations. We purposely booked the weekend at this hotel for our bachelorette party because of the amenities that they offered first off our experience was to be started at the rooftop restaurant, which, of course was no fault to the restaurant got cancelled because of the rain, however They had no accommodations for us alternatively, in the hotel therefore we had no dinner reservations. We had to go to roses social, which was OK but the menu is just for pub food basically And of course it was too late to get any reservation at a nice restaurant in Toronto so even though they had interior seating for Valerie, they did not accommodate us because they were overbooked\\nThe hotel was extremely packed way too many people and therefore even to get some lunch, it was impossible. The caf\\u00E9 was closed at 3:00 PM and we ordered room service, which was our only choice since everything else was packed and it took over an hour and a half to get any type of food., Service Food was good once we actually received it\\nFollowing our dinner was supposed to be entertainment on level 27 as well as the lobby bar, which is a public bar that they normally have open to which were closed due to the 27th floor for personal party and the lobby bar is completely closed when they knew they had a full Capacity hotel that was further from the downtown region. I called to discuss charges on my card as well as my disappointment and of course no return call. No one seem to know or care about anything there Other than the one bartender at the pool bar Who completely resonated with us. \\nI would never return to this establishment. It was a complete disappointment",
            "I booked a night for my son and I to stay and enjoy the pool and amenities through Expedia, and due to covid they require that you book a reservation for the pool. I called countless times with no answer ahead of time, and emailed multiple times over a few weeks prior to our visit. Finally the day before we arrive they wrote to say because we booked on Expedia, we weren't allowed to reserve ahead of time, only those who book directly at the hotel.\\nConsequently, when we arrived we could only go to the pool after 5 pm.\\nTheir rooftop lounge took 25 mins for a drink and both food orders were wrong. \\nWe went to have a drink in the lobby before dinner and we're told that drinks would be 20 mins. \\nI actually stayed here before and the service was Fantastic, not sure what happened to this place- which is unfortunate as I live in the area and would have frequented the place for corporate events",
            "This hotel is nice to look at, but unfortunately for me the service and actual comfort is lacking. Very superficial type of place. \\n\\nFor the price you pay, you should expect world class customer service; this doesn\\u2019t exist. We had a loud neighbour the first night partying until 4am. Made several calls to the front desk and not a single one was answered. Had no choice but to just stay awake and listen to the party all night. \\n\\nBeds are also extremely stiff and uncomfortable. Feel like cheap box springs. \\n\\nRooms controls are confusing, specifically the light switches. Need a PHD to figure out how to turn the lights on. \\n\\nCafe opened late every morning so wasn\\u2019t able to get anything besides a $50 room service breakfast every day. \\n\\nOnly nice thing was the washrooms\\u002Fshower. They did a great job with that",
            "We had the greatest experience at Hotel X for one night Sept 1st. We stayed in room 1103 (corner suite) was beautiful. The room delivers amazing views of Lake Ontario, Porter Airport, Yacht club, Ontario place and the CNE.  We were lucky to enjoy the jets practicing for the air show & had a great night sleep.  With the window shut it was not noisy at all with the exhibition happening.\\nThe roof top pool views were just as beautiful while enjoying a few drinks.  We had lunch at Roses on the 2nd floor. I have shellfish & egg allergies so brioche buns are not good for me, the server was quick to assure me there would be no issues at all. I enjoyed a tasty burger on grilled sourdough rye, the staff where extremely accommodating and very friendly.   I will surely stay again",
            "We stayed 5 nights in December visiting from\\nVancouver and we had such a great experience from the time we checked in. The staff were all very friendly and helpful especially Priyan he went over and beyond to ensure we had the right room and even showed us a few upgrade options. The hotel is very clean and the rooms are especially clean and well laid out. Housekeeping did a very good job with daily water replenishment and the Nespresso machine was a great bonus. The powered window coverings worked very well and having L\\u2019Occitane bath products just confirms that this hotel stay is going to be good. The heat thermostat worked well and the washroom fan was so quiet you could not tell it was on! We used the theatre one evening and with our kids we had popcorn and again the service was amazing. The rooftop pool even in December was nice and warm.\\n\\nThank you for making our stay a real home from home experience and we had such an excellent time in Toronto and Hotel X exceeded our expectations",
            "First time staying at this hotel. I chose it because I was going to a concert with a friend  at the Budweiser venue. For this reason alone, it was worth the stay! So convenient to be able to walk to the concert. \\nThe hotel is modern and attractive. The bellman and front desk were very  helpful and friendly. Unfortunately, that\\u2019s where  the 5 star  service ends. The service at the restaurants was slow and cold. \\nYou need to make an appointment to visit the pool but it is still chaotic. Very disorganized and almost impossible to get a drink. We asked the waitress several times for assistance but she just ignored us- very rude! There is a definite party atmosphere up there and I would hesitate to bring children anywhere near the pool. \\nThere is no turndown which you expect from a 5 star.\\nRoom service took over an hour for breakfast and the order was messed up.\\nThe location right on Lakeshore is quite noisy, but the views are spectacular.\\nOver all it was an ok stay, but I don\\u2019t think I would stay again if I wasn\\u2019t going to the Budweiser sage",
            "Overall, our stay at Hotel X was quite good , but could have been very great. Starting with the positive, the room, amenities, and staff are top notch, attentive, and informative. Andray, who helped us with our bags, was especially gracious and helpful. The location isn't near much of anything, although, the hotel provides a house car that takes you wherever you want to go (when booked in advance and within a 3-kilometer measurement). The pool is great, but guests are relegated to a 2-hour window and must reserve their space in advance. The hotel is huge, and yet the amenities feel limited. Now for the sour note; unfortunately, the hotel made several erroneous charges to our credit card, and while they were apologetic and provided a mediocre fruit plate and truffles to amend the situation, additional erroneous charges were made after we sat with management to suss out the situation. It caused undue stress during what was supposed to be an overall joyful experience. And while the hotel admitted this was their fault, it did not leave the best of feelings that the most competent people are handling the check-in process. The two managers explained everything and were contrite, but even on our last day, we were still trying to figure out how to get the money refunded and be charged the correct amount. Lastly, the clientele isn't very diverse. On the surface, one might say, Well, the hotel has nothing to do with that, but any company can make an effort to market to a wider, more diverse clientele. Clearly, that is not happening here, and it should be so that all people feel comfortable amongst all people. So overall, the hotel is fantastic, but be sure to check your bill, twice, before checking out to ensure you are being charged the correct amount",
            "I will have to say, my stay was  very frustrating. It was my anniversary and the hotel did nothing to celebrate it. Literally nothing, zero hospitality.\\n1) at the SPA they mixed up my couples massage and took us separate. We ended up getting into one room and they did give us free samples after due to the mix up\\n2) The front desk says you can only book a 2 hour time slot for the rooftop pool. So we go an I see other couples granted back to back time slots and when I asked the worker at the pool, they said front desk granted it. This is my anniversary, are others \\\"buying\\\" their time? They wouldnt even let us sit in a complete empty seating area. In addition, it took 35 mins and going to a waiter 3 times for us to order food. The waiters were not interested, very slow.\\n3) Then my wife and I figure, lets go the Valerie to get a quick bite to eat, they say we are not allowed because brunch is over. Yet its all completely empty and we could even sit!\\n4) We go to the ROSA COCINA resturant and again, they recognize its our anniversary and dont bring ANYTHING to recognize our day.\\n\\nI told front desk about this and they did nothing and jus said sorry. TO be honest, this is a very nice hotel with lots to do. But I will say, it is by far the worst service Ive ever had anywhere I have ever gone. And they could care less about it being my anniversary.\\n\\nHonestly, dont go and save your money",
            "What a great hotel! Terrific amenities and an incredibly friendly, responsive staff. We were in Room 1116 and had a beautiful view back on to downtown Toronto. The room was clean, they provided water daily, the coffee machine in the room was a Nespresso, etc. We needed extra pillows and they sent them up promptly. \\n\\nWe ate at all three dining options (Cafe X, Roses and Valerie) and had a good meal or snack at each. The views from Valerie are gorgeous!\\n\\nThe only downside, which is small in my opinion, is the beautiful pool area is small and, therefore, they limit the number of persons who can use it at any given time. During summer, you make a reservation for a two-hour block of time there. But, the view is stunning and again, the staff are great. \\n\\nWe had no trouble getting Ubers\\u002FLyfts. There is a shared bike rack right across the street. and the street cars stop nearby. In other words, we had no trouble getting anywhere. While not in the heart of the downtown area, you are so close that it is an easy walk, ride, or bike ride to get there.\\n\\nWe were here with family, ages 13-64, and we all enjoyed this stay. Highly recommend! And if we return to Toronto, this is where we will stay",
            "There are truly no words for this hotel . From the moment you arrive to that lobby and scent the views of Toronto are spectacular and the pool only adds to that! The rooms are so well executed with all you need and the full glass windows are OMG! The beds and linen are divine , you truly don\\u2019t want to leave. We ate two meals ( dinner and brunch ) at Roses and both were exceptional ! Service couldn\\u2019t be better . We felt as if we were so special for our entire visit ! If you feel like a magical weekend away, RUN don\\u2019t walk to Hotel X",
            "I was tasked with finding a hotel for our group in Toronto. Having never really spent time in the city (besides the airport), I chose based on location, price point, and reviews. We chose Hotel X, and were extremely glad we did. Modern, clean, professional\\u002Fhelpful staff, very upscale\\u2026plus Starbucks basically right in the hotel. All the things that I look for in a great hotel! We ended up booking adjoining rooms that had two queen beds in one, and a king bed, (large bathroom - two sinks) and living room in the other. Wow! Perfect for our needs! The large windows and views from our room of the water\\u002Fcity skyline were fantastic. We had only very minor issues, and not worth removing a star for, but I will mention in terms of feedback for the hotel. No ice available on the hotel floor, so you have to call down for ice. It\\u2019s not a huge deal, but we didn\\u2019t like having to bother staffers and wait for ice. Also, the rooms had a \\u201Cmain\\u201D light switch, that if you didn\\u2019t have on, meant the bathroom lights wouldn\\u2019t go on. This caused a bit of stress until we figured it out. Again, minor things, but this is an honest review. We didn\\u2019t take advantage of the cool things available in the hotel on this trip (screening room, Pilates, tennis court etc) but hope to next time. We thoroughly enjoyed our evening at the restaurant Valerie on the hotels\\u2019 top floors - great sushi and atmosphere! Overall, we were very happy with the hotel and would definitely stay again",
            "I really enjoy every stay I have at Hotel X, it is definitely my go-to place for staycations in Toronto because the property literally has everything you could ever ask for!  The rooftop pool is by far my favourite as it's never over-crowded (due to having reserved times) & the pool side drink service is always a lovely extra (shout out to Quincey who is so friendly and great!)  This stay we really enjoyed spending time in our room; which was impeccably clean and had a lovely view.  A special mention to Armhie from housekeeping who made us feel so incredibly special during our stay, she really went above and beyond and exceeded our expectations!  The front desk staff was so lovely and welcoming (Parnav was great!) and we really enjoyed Roses Social for brunch- special mentions to Starr and Harshit for their excellent customer service!  If you haven't tried the huevos rancheros dish at Roses you need to, it's the best! We will be back, thank you Hotel X",
            "A family of 3, we stayed here both in 2018 and 2019 and so were very much looking forward to doing so again now the pandemic has allowed international travel. Once again it has been an outstanding experience. The staff are all courteous and helpful, the room is always spotlessly clean and well presented and the location across the way from Lake Ontario and the Budweiser Stage is wonderful. The facilities are incredible from a roof top pool to tennis courts, table tennis, basketball and even it's own cinema. On our next visit to Toronto from the UK, there is nowhere else we'll be staying. A special mention to MD Fariyal Hasham for his assistance before, during and after our stay",
            "This review is a little late in coming, but as they say, better late than never.... Hotel X... where do I start. Grandeur in size, exuberant in style and excellence in customer service.   My husband and I were there for our anniversary in December of 2019.   We loved the facility, there is so much to do.   It was everything we wanted and more for our anniversary.  A special thanks  to Director of Sales, Saira.  Her passion shines through, each time she talks about what the hotel has to offer.  If it wasn't for her we would not have enjoyed the hotel as much as we did.  Saira, is passionate about this facility and presents this to clients with great pride.  This library hotel is equipped with books everywhere, borrow a book from anywhere  in the hotel, take it to your room or the pool side and  enjoy it.  The hotel has a theatre, an art gallery, an all season outdoor pool, state of the art tennis court and gym...  The resturants and the VIP lounge offers great good selections. \\nIf you are visiting as a family, there is tons to do for the kids.  \\nWe loved our stay so much that we will be returning with our family soon. \\nOnce again thank you Saira for making our stay so memorable. Looking forward to coming back soon.",
            "My stay here was so amazing! It was a great staycation. The COVID protocol is on point. All the staff wear their masks correctly, self cleaning elevator buttons, sanitizer everywhere, pool bookings are 2 hours so you always get time at the pool, the lounge chairs are spaced out as well as seating in the restaurants.\\n\\nThe staff were all so nice. We got a sweets tray upon welcome, early check in, late check out, extra pool bookings, free parking, breakfast for two, room upgrade. I recommend booking the bed and breakfast package - it's worth it!\\n\\nNo complaints at all. Great job Hotel X and thank you!",
            "Words cannot describe my stay at this downtown luxury. Me and my wife stayed overnight to give us a retreat from the city while we are currently under the \\\"grey\\\" zone\\n\\nThe view was spectacular and the breakfast was the best I ever had from any Hotels I have visited.  \\n\\nThe Guerlain Spa was def worth the price, shouts out to Julie! \\n\\nThanks Hotel X, especially Steven and Carlos for their warm and friendly manners during our stay \\n\\nWill visit again the future",
            "We stayed in Hotel X in June 2024 as part of a 3 week holiday. From the moment we checked in the staff were so helpful, we received complimentary cold bottles of water and the check-in process was so smooth! \\n\\nOur room was fab, great size and the hotels location is perfect. On the other side of the main road in the marina and there's a perfect little walkway into midtown. There are also rental bikes across the road which we used. \\n\\nThe staff were really helpful and gave us lots of tips and helpful advice. You also get free use of the house car within a 5km boundary. Make sure and book this service in advance with reception",
            "Stayed one night at Hotel X on a Friday and no issues. The parking in the garage is easy, getting checked in no problem. Beautiful room and view.\\nWedding was great, food and drinks \\uD83D\\uDC4C.\\nBreakfast at the Cafe was nice but expensive of course. My parking ticket was not working so the gentlemen at the front desk let me go without paying for parking which was very kind.\\nThanks Hotel X and hope to see ya again real soon",
            "We arrived an hour and a half before check in as you need a reservation for the pool and we were hoping for some outside pool time before a concert.  We were told we could go at 7pm or 7am the next day.  Value for dollar I\\u2019ve had better rooms and better and consistent access to outdoor space at radisson blu down the road.  I\\u2019m disappointed for the price paid, I am essentially having to stay in my room.  Will not be staying here again, while the location is convenient to Budweiser Stage, not being able to use the only amenity I booked the hotel for (outdoor pool) has put a sour taste in my mouth.  If outdoor pool access is what you want, then save your money and book elsewhere",
            "My second time staying here. Truly one of the best hotels I\\u2019ve ever stayed at. The rooms are cleans and top notch. Even the soap smells amazing.  The service is impeccable!  Will never stay elsewhere.\\nWas Sitting in the lobby waiting for an Uber, out of nowhere, the power man walks up and puts a bottle of water in front of me. Did not even ask for it.\\n\\nExceptional service",
            "This is such a beautiful hotel and the perfect location to stay at it you are attending an event at Budweiser Garden.  The convenience can't be beat.  Imagine being back at your room ten minutes after the event ends?  Having stayed in downtown Toronto many times, this is my all time favourite Toronto Hotel.   I love staying near the water and the lakefront trails can't be beat.  Easily within a half hour walking distance to many neat restaurants and activities along the shore.  The hotel itself is very luxurious and the staff could not be nicer or more accommodating.  The rooftop pool is fantastic as is the hotel fitness centre!  Have been back many times and will return again",
            "Paid over $500 for a one night stay and while the rooms were comfortable, had nice views and some of the staff we encountered we're friendly that's about where the good stops. The main reason a lot of people (including ourselves) book this hotel is because of the rooftop pool that floods all of their advertisements however what they fail to mention is that you only get one 2 hour time slot per stay to use the pool and you can't even pick your own hours you have to go with the times they offer, we were offered a 9a.m- 11a.m timeslot and when we were offered this it was already 10:15 a.m leaving us only 45 minutes to enjoy the pool, there is also no way to pre book your pool time before check in to prepare for this rule and no you are not allowed to stay and use it after check out either if you didn't get a chance during your stay.  We have stayed at many hotels in the city both luxury and budget friendly and have never had to book a pool slot (outside of covid) and not been allowed to stay and enjoy hotel amenities after check out. It's very clear that all this hotel cares about is taking as much money from their guests as possible without actually wanting to provide the service that should come with the steep price tag. If you're looking for a hotel in Toronto with a luxury feel who also have pools with amazing views and actually care about their guests I'd recommend the Sheraton Center or Fairmount",
            "Hotel was lovely, rooms were clean, was a beautiful space, but very disappointed in guest experience.\\n\\nFelt as though we were unable to use most of the in-house complimentary amenities from the concierge car service to pool. Almost everything was booked up by the time we checked-in for our one night stay and the hotel was chosen specifically for what it offered. We were able to use the screening room which was great, but the room was clearly not cleaned before our reserved time as there was other guests trash throughout the space\\u002F all over the floor.\\n\\nGlad they\\u2019re investing in a second pool because for what was able to be reserved (an outdoor dining chair for 1 hour as other guests had thrown their towels on pool loungers when they were not needed) is not a relaxing or luxury hotel experience.\\n\\nPlease do better for your guests who are not there for\\u002F apart of weddings",
            "We had the most incredible girls weekend at Hotel X!  From the moment we checked in, we felt like royalty.  We stayed in the a corner suite with the most amazing views from all directions.  The living room style set up was perfect for lounging, relaxing and having a great catch up with friends.\\n\\nOur room had an incredible bathroom with a large soaker tub.  The water pressure in the stand up shower was incredible (always a bonus).  Just off of the washroom was a beautiful little vanity complete with cosmetic mirror and lights.\\n\\nThe concierge Stephen was AMAZING and so helpful in helping us select our restaurant for the evening.  As we were celebrating birthdays he also arranged for a beautiful surprise bottle of Rose to be sent up to our room.\\n\\nAfter a night on the town, we returned to our room and had the most incredible sleep!  Housekeeping had set up our pull out bed and the turndown service was lovely.  I have to say that the beds and bedding at Hotel X are top notch.\\n\\nOn Saturday morning we visited 10XTO, the beautiful luxury athletic club attached to the Hotel.  My girlfriend and I went to a Pilates reformer class with Joanna.  She was an amazing instructor and delivered an awesome class.\\n\\nFollowing our workout, we went to the Sky Bar for Lunch and took in the last moments of the breathtaking view.  We ordered one of each the Asian inspired appetizers (all delicious).\\n\\nIf you are looking for a 5 star experience for your next girls get away, Hotel X is the place to be.  We will absolutely be back!",
            "Do not stay here if you expect any service as a hotel guest. So unwelcoming and absolutely not worth the steep price. I\\u2019m from Toronto and paid for a one bedroom suite which cost just over $1000 for a bachelorette. Might as well have stayed at home.  I called room service to order 2 martinis and the lady on the other line said \\u201Cwe don\\u2019t do that\\u201D. When asked what that means she said they don\\u2019t provide alcohol, which is fine but she didn\\u2019t tell me what my options were since there was no in-room bar fridge. When pressed she stated that they only have \\u201Ccanned alcohol\\u201D and if I want a martini I should call the front desk and they can get one from one of the restaurants. Long story short, after about a dozen unanswered calls to front desk and guest services I was told they can\\u2019t help me and my best bet was to try to go to the restaurant myself and get the drinks. To be clear, they weren\\u2019t actually sure this would work. I also highly doubt the restaurant would allow me to walk around the hotel with 2 martinis\\u2026 \\n\\nI also booked the hotel solely for the pool which we basically couldn\\u2019t use. My checkout was at 12 but apparently I could only book the pool from 9-11 EVEN THOUGH checkout was at 12. They don\\u2019t stipulate this when you book the hotel unless it\\u2019s in MICRO print somewhere I didn\\u2019t see. We got there around 9:30 am and there were no lounge chairs. We had to sit on hard, uncomfortable patio chairs and were forced to leave at 11 am. \\n\\nDo not stay here and use you hard-earned money to go to a hotel that services their guests. \\",
            "My fiancee and I booked Hotel X as soon as lockdown was being lifted and it was the best decision we could have made. As someone who travels to countless of resorts for business - Hotel X truly reminded me of a destination resort. It was such an amazing escape from the day to day. The food, service and amenities are incomparable to other hotels in the city. Yuna & Matt went out of their way to make sure our stay was nothing less than perfect. We booked the pool with ease and had a great time at the rooftop pool. We had dinner at The Grill (you have to try to the flatbread!). It was such a great way to feel some normalcy during the pandemic and Hotel X made sure we felt safe and everything was always cleaned and sanitized. Our room had an incredible view and the comfiest bed. We can't wait to return next month -this is definitely now our go to staycation spot",
            "This is a phenomenal hotel and my preferred hotel whenever I visit Toronto. The second you walk in, you are greeted by a very clean signature scent and a breathtaking live wall. The service at the front desk is unmatched. The rooms are large, clean, modern and super comfortable. There are multiple restaurants available in house, which is very helpful in Toronto winters where you might not want to venture outside. The additional amenities (pool, golf, racquetball, Pilates studio and more) allow for team building activities and self care options when staying. Overall an amazing property.",
            "Our check and check out were seamless.  The staff is unbelievable and so pleasant. It took a couple tries to get through to room service. I heard that from a few people.  The lights are bit complicated but once you figure them out no problem.  We were escorted to our room with our bags but the bellman did not go over the room ammenities and how the lights worked.  The rooms were well laid out but some of the furniture was showing its age. The beds were comfortable.  The hotel is beautiful has great views and tons to offer from gym facilities to tennis courts and a spa.  The location is not really accessible for walking or sightseeing you definitely need a car or ride share.  I am rating this hotel based on the staff and amenities. I think the rooms are completely over priced for what you get. You could stay and many other high end hotels for the same money that offer more in terms of locations and luxury.",
            "Lovely property with very luxorious amneties. Absolutely beautiful view from our room on the 23rd floor.\\n\\nComplimentary soaps from the room had amazing fragrences and really made you feel like you were at a spa",
            "Thanks to the great staff and accommodations at Hotel X my family enjoyed an amazing two-day winter break stay in Toronto. My teenage boys enjoyed the part-indoor, part-outdoor infinity pool on the 28th floor, even though it was January. The Aurora Winter Festival along the lake was amazing and a short walk from the hotel. The hotel was kind enough to provide comp tickets. We also received free tix to the Second City Improv performance at one of the two theaters in the hotel, which the entire family enjoyed. One of the my boys loves books and thoroughly enjoyed the library at the property. My boys also enjoyed the attached sports facility where we played basketball and ping pong and fitness center for free. Because we were celebrating my wife's birthday, the staff was also kind enough to surprise her with a special treat in our hotel room. We totally recommend adding the Library Club Lounge to your experience. The breakfast and happy hour and attentive staff are totally worth the extra expense. My wife also enjoyed her time at the onsite spa, where again the staff and treatment could not have been better. Hotel X was truly the highlight of our Toronto experience",
            "We stayed for two nights over the Easter long weekend and had a fabulous time. Very friendly staff. The concierge Steve stood out in particular - he is a true professional who paid special attention to ensure our kids had a great time! \\n\\nIt\\u2019s a beautiful modern hotel. We especially enjoyed the heated rooftop pool, spacious movie room with popcorn and drinks, access to the gym\\u002Ftennis\\u002Fracquetball, ping pong and basketball, and the kids play centre (small fee) that had sports, electronics, and arts. The concierge planned an Easter egg hunt for the kids which was a big hit! \\n\\nBreakfast was delicious! Next time we\\u2019ll take advantage of the Guerlain spa. I bought some perfumes which are exclusive and hard to find. The only downside was that the lounge was closed and the skybar is under renovations. It would have been nice to experience those amenities. But we had a fabulous time nonetheless and will be back",
            "Hotel X is a dreamy, well designed hotel with excellent amenities. I fell in love with the design and decor of the public spaces of the hotel. My room was large, well appointed and had many great features: robes & slippers, Nespresso machine, automatic black out blind, good lighting, ample plugs and USB ports, an ultra comfortable bed and a nice sunset view. \\n\\nThe 24\\u002F7 fitness centre can\\u2019t be beat. I love that I was able to sign up for a hot yoga class too (additional charge).\\n\\nI liked the lake view. I didn\\u2019t try the restaurants but liked the Nespresso cafe and appreciated the convenience of the attached Starbucks. \\n\\nI stayed at this hotel for work while attending a conference at the beanfield centre so the location was unbeatable. I would definitely stay in this hotel again, especially if I don\\u2019t have a need to be right downtown. It\\u2019s worth nothing it\\u2019s a close walk to the island airport (and they have a free shuttle) for added convenience",
            "We had originally booked a room here for our wedding weekend in 2020. After postponing and eventually cancelling the big wedding, we weren't able to get a refund on the room so we used the excuse for a mini honeymoon. The service was excellent, all staff very friendly and responsive. The one bedroom suite was beautiful, with views of both the water and the city skyline. Booking reservations at the pool was efficient, as was reserving a table at the Falcon Sky bar.  We had drinks there on Friday night, great atmosphere, great DJ, only complaint was no drink menu to see a list of cocktails or have any idea of pricing. \\nFor a suite, I thought the bar area could have been a bit better equipped; the mini fridge is extremely small, not many glasses or extra utensils\\u002Fwine tools for entertaining. \\nLighting in the room was excellent, always appreciate dimmer switches! \\nWe tried to book the car service that drops guests off within a 5km radius of the hotel, however  it's not running due to Covid...this seemed a little strange as taxis\\u002FUbers are all operating with easy protocols in place. \\nThe rooftop pool is really nice, great views and limited capacity which means you can't stay for more than two hours but it doesn't get crowded which we appreciated. \\nOnly minor complaint would be that extended checkout is only 30 minutes, which doesn't make much of a difference. \\nOverall we had a great stay, very comfortable, clean and relaxing environment.  \\",
            "We chose to stay here based on a friend's recommendation, and the service, amenities, food, views, and value were outstanding! We were in a junior suite, which was spacious, came with everything you could possibly need (robe, slippers, umbrella, etc), was absolutely silent on a Saturday\\u002FSunday night, and included access to the Library Lounge. We paid for breakfast at Maxx's on our first morning, and utilized the complimentary breakfast in the lounge on our second day. The staff were terrific, room service was great, all of the bars had great city views, the art gallery on the lower level was gorgeous, and the rooftop pool even has an accessibility chair to lower people into the water. They have truly thought of everything. It was too cold to enjoy the wraparound balcony but we look forward to coming back in better weather",
            "Managed to sneak away with the hubby for a weekend at the end of last summer and had such an amazing time.  The views, staff and facilities were fantastic!  Was a little skeptical given the situation but felt immediately at ease from the moment we got there.  Staff was very attentive, and I really liked the added touch of being able to communicate everything through text message.  I needed extra towels and a facecloth and just texted.  So convenient!  Discovered later that they had tennis courts?  Wow, wish I knew beforehand so I could have brought the right shoes!\\n\\nNow I know and will definitely be back once this COVID stuff is done",
            "This hotel is not only sleek and modern but a perfect place to stay when attending a concert at Bud Stage.  A quick walk over saves so much stress in having to find parking and waiting in traffic.  Had a delicious meal at ROSES Cocina and room service breakfast was amazing as well.  Staff was professional and friendly including the valet staff who did their best to try and keep us dry during a rain storm.  Only real improvement note I would make was when at the pool we didn't see anyone coming around to take drink orders.  We had to go in and order and pick up drinks ourselves.  Not sure if poolside drink service is usually available but may be a missed opportunity for those wanting to enjoy a drink or two while at the pool.  We had two teenagers as well with us who really enjoyed everything about the stay and have already asked to go again!  Thank you for a great night",
            "Hotel is very nice and modern!  It is close to the Budweiser Concert venue so perfect if you are going to an event there.  There is not a lot else within a 10 minute walking distance and while you can walk several kilometers into downtown, easier to take an Uber which wasn't the most convenient.  Our room also overlooked a festival that was apparently happening that weekend and there was a DJ until midnight both nights.  It was very loud.  Elevators are also very fast!  The pool was crowded and much smaller than it looks online.  There are reservations but I don't think they were enforcing people to leave after their two hours time slot.  We had no room to sit when we were there as it was completely full (came up about 20 min into our 2 hour block).  Weather was a little cool so we decided not to stay.  Better management of the pool, letting guests know about the loud festival, and location to downtown would make this a 5 rating.  If we go back for a concert would definitely stay here a night but other than that would pick somewhere closer to downtown or the harbour area",
            "Stayed two nights with a friend in a suite to attend a\\nbachelorette weekend. We specifically picked this\\nhotel to have a relaxing pool day Sunday at the end\\nof the weekend. \\n\\nCome to find out at check in amenities can not be used last check out (noon). Have been to several luxury resorts around the world and this is not consistent with those experiences. Have always been able to use the amenities after check out. Further, you may only book for a two hour window. Fine. They allow us to book the llam-1:00pm window. They inform us only guests on the reservation may use the pool, so we added the bride (who lives in Toronto) to the reservation for the Saturday night so she could join us by the pool Sunday. The hotel charged us $50 for this. We arrive promptly at 1lam for our two hour scheduled visit Sunday and there is not a single lounger for us to use. The bride needs an even tan for her wedding next weekend and had to lay towels on the ground to tan her back. See pictures for the kind of luxury pool experience you can expect at hotel X. How disappointing. Would\\nhave chosen a different hotel had we known all of\\nthe stipulations and complications of using the\\nrooftop pool. Even if you follow all the rules you'll still\\nend up tanning on the ground. There is a plethora of\\nspace up there the hotel should invest in 50 more\\nloungers and get ride of all the chairs",
            "We had the best time :) The hotel and amenities are amazing. Everyone who works at the hotel is friendly and professional. Two random things: the shower has tremendous water pressure!!! and the ventilation system in the room is completely silent, for those who hate that type of noise. We would definitely stay again",
            "Reposting since my first post got deleted. Guess they\\u2019re trying to hid their unethical practices that could possibly be a violation to public health!\\n\\nTo sum up my previous post, I over heard 2 hotel staff members talking to one another in great detail about how the pool water never gets changed. One gentleman mentioned that every night, they dump a ton of chlorine to \\u201Cclean\\u201D the pool. He even said that feces and urine have been found in the pool several times and all they do is scoop it out and dump more chlorine in, which in my opinion does not seem all too effective. You\\u2019re pretty much swimming in a pool with bits of human waste! To my knowledge, the pool water is just as old as the hotel! I do not recommend anyone staying at this shady so call 5 star hotel that can\\u2019t maintain their pool properly",
            "Stayed here with our young kids for a staycation. Room (superior queen) was the perfect size and the view of the water and airport made the kids super happy. The in room amenities for the kids such as milk and desserts, balloons, stuffies and colouring pages were above and beyond to make their stay extra special. The kids play centre was great, well equipped with toys and video games, and the staff was very caring and attentive to the kids. The entire property was beautifully kept and well equipped with the pool, virtual golf, gym, etc. we didn\\u2019t use the gym much but it was probably one of the more impressive facilities I\\u2019ve seen anywhere. The pool was small (the indoor part; outdoor is much bigger) but the water was warm and we still enjoyed it. Service at the restaurant onsite was excellent, but I will note that it\\u2019s your only food option so there\\u2019s not a lot of variety. However, you can always order delivery so not a big deal. The concierges were always kind and helpful, and I will note that the manager Pranav went out of his way to help us book the room according to our needs, and ensure we had a good stay. The retro arcade room was really well done as well, we enjoyed using that. The rooms are very clean and everything is very up to date, I even noted the elevator buttons were self sanitizing! It\\u2019s 5 stars in terms of most aspects, not quite like the Ritz Carlton or ShangriLa, but this property was way more fun than those places and much better value. We would definitely stay again, and that\\u2019s really what matters",
            "Stayed at this hotel in summer 2019.  Excellent service and amenities.  Location is also great for access to the Enercare Centre. Only recommendation is that guests be able to access the squash club during their stay",
            "I live in Toronto and selected this hotel to host a group weekend to celebrate an upcoming wedding. \\nI met 7 out-of-town guests on Friday. From the moment we pulled up until we checked out, the staff was authentically courteous. \\nThe hotel exceeded my expectations from the website and online photos. \\nWe used a number of the amenities during our 2 night stay. \\nHot yoga, gym equipment, pool and steam rooms were enjoyed the first day. The pool is partially indoors with access (swim under the glass divider) to the outdoor pool. It is fully heated and we swam outside during the snowstorm!  The indoor pool is very limited for space. Most of the pool space is outdoor.  \\nWe had the package that included 4:30 wine and cheese as well as the continental breakfast. Both services were superb. \\nWith our own curiosity tour, we saw the multiple squash courts, the 10XTO fitness facilities and dined in Maxx's restaurant. All amenities impressed everyone in our group. \\nWe had free self parking and it was very easy and hassle free access to the hotel elevator. \\nEvery employee, no matter what part of the hotel you were in, had a smile and were eager to help however needed. \\nYou can certainly come here and have no reason to leave if you're looking for a getaway to chill and treat yourself. \\nI live 15 min away and plan to book family Staycations in the near future.",
            "I basically chose this hotel at such an off-centre location because it had a full gym with fitness centre, yoga classes, steam room and even tennis courts! However, surprise, surprise, steam room is only accessible to gym members. And, not surprisingly, yoga classes cost 25$ each and 47$ for the tennis courts. In the end, I simply used the fitness centre without being able to relax after my activities in the steam room. \\nThere are also steam rooms at the adjacent Guerlain spa but at the hefty price of 280$ for a 90-minute massage that is not even done by a regular massage therapist, so they won\\u2019t be giving receipts. Won\\u2019t be coming back. It is just not worthwhile"

            "This hotel is BEAUTIFUL. Rooms are perfect could not fault in anyway. Love the d\\u00E9cor, pretty balcony with the sound of running water from the fountain downstairs, bathroom is MASSIVE and they provide a menu of bath salts. Very clean and very comfortable bed. The location is also very central and easy walk of the Greyhound bus stop. We felt massively let down by the breakfasts. With the room rate being so high you would expect more. I don't mind that the breakfast is on a tray for you to collect when you wish. As this allowed no time limit to having to get up and it was nice to have in the room still in robes. However what is provided is very limited. As I have a special diet I was given a bowl of chopped fruit. My husband was given one croissant and a small slice of loaf\\u002Fcake. I would expect a gluten free option to be more than just fruit. Surely Canada has some sort of bread\\u002Ffruit bread\\u002Fbreakfast treat. I would stay again but would be buying my own breakfast",
            "The Ivy isn\\u00B4t so much a classical hotel. It\\u00B4s a business club with serveral nice meeting lounges, a lady fitness studio, a spa and perhaps the best restaurant \\\"George\\\" I have ever eaten at. We were told - also there was no one, when we we stayed - that the Ivy is a hot spot for weddings in Toronto. And I can understand this.\\n\\nThe rooms - they only have four, so feel yourself luck if you get one - are big and lovely decorated, with over king size beds which might be the most comfortable I ever had sleeped in, a big bath - seperated shower and closet - with Bulgari toiletries and several different bathing salts available for disposal in the big bathing tube.\\n\\nThe breakfast - croissant, cake, fresh fruit and juice, coffee or tea, everything excellent - was offered on tray outside the room on an old french pastries table and had to be carried in your room. We ate it on our balcony with view to the patio. Great start of the day. Coffee (Nespresso) and softdrinks were complimentary the whole day. \\n\\nThe hotel itself is very central, probably 10 min walk to Eaton Center with a subway station just around the corner and big public parking space on the other side of the street.\\n \\nSo go there, even if you don\\u00B4t want to mary",
            "Wonderful hotel, clean, very well decorated, staff were great!\\nThe room was big, beds were comfortable, bathroom was a very nice and we had a balcony. Great room.\\nThe only sad thing is we arrived on a Sunday and the restaurant was closed, would have very much like to eat at the George restaurant.\\nAlso I would have given it a 5 star experience but the parking was a block and half away.\\",
            "I've been staying in Marriotts, Hiltons and Holiday Inns for over 4 years with work, but it's only by coming to The Ivy that I'm reminded how good a hotel experience you can have if you go to the boutique places.\\nThe first thing is even though this is effectively 'an old boys club for women', my wife booked it for our first trip to Toronto and we both found it to be utterly beautiful, relaxing and a joy to stay in. We could happily move into room 3 and never leave, the bed and bathroom are brilliant, the honesty bar and espresso machine outside the room make you feel at home to come and go as you please, the staff were super friendly and helpful, and even though the spa is women only they allowed us in after hours. As for the George restaurant, we've never had a better tasting menu anywhere in the world. A rare foodie experience I'll not forget in a hurry.\\nOne of those places that genuinely nourishes your body and mind. Can't say enough good things about it",
            "The Ivy is a small unique hotel -  four rooms in total - all different and beautifully appointed.  The beds are the most comfortable ever, with the finest of linens.  Decor is simply gorgeous,  beautiful ly upholstered seating, exposed brick walls and lovely wallpapers, bamboo hardwood floors and bamboo tiles in the luxurious bathrooms. Each room has a balcony overlooking an inner city courtyard.  The Ivy is part of Verity Womens Club and upstairs from George Restaurant.  The club's spa and fitness facilities are open to guests .  You feel like a pampered personal friend  rather than a hotel guest..  A small guest lounge with a marble table with selection of fine spirits and wine is part of the lovely surroundings.  Definitely for discerning independent travellers who like to discover unique and special properties",

It\\u2019s every bit (and better) what the hotels pictures show. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed every second. \\n\\n10\\u002F10 the best hotel we\\u2019ve every stayed in.

            "This centrally located downtown Toronto hotel is extremely spacious, beautifully appointed and impeccably conceived. I'd like to move in. (The continental breakfast delivered to your door, the heated flooring in the very large bathroom, the generous balcony overlooking the intimate brick courtyard, the gorgeous drapes and furniture...) And yes, of course, all the technology required for a 21st century traveler",
            "The rooms at the Ivy are so beautiful, you really don't want to leave them.  Save time to enjoy the spa like bath, with an assortment of scented salts and heated floors - enjoy a drink or breakfast on the balcony overlooking the secluded patio of the George restaurant - and make sure you get your full eight hours sleep in the heavenly beds - amazing comfort and luxury.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, each one with a different interior design, and unlike anything you would get at a large chain hotel.  Within walking distance of downtown Toronto, the Ivy is conveniently located albeit off the beaten path.  We liked being able to enjoy a bottle of champagne in the seating area outside the rooms as a group - almost like being in your own home - before heading downstairs to the wonderful George restaurant. Personal and knowledgable concierge staff - access to Internet and computers - on site spa - and ambience from the exclusive Verity Women's Club.  I have stayed at the Ivy many times, and already am looking forward to my next visit",
            "Not only our favorite place in Toronto, the Ivy at Verity is one of the nicest and most perfects hotels we have ever stayed at.  My mom and I, who take a trip every year, enjoyed the spacious and intricately decorated Room # 3.  Everything was spotless, comfortable, and beautiful.  Every detail of this \\\"hotel\\\" (more like an oasis) was designed and thought through.  I oftentimes found myself wanting to return to the Ivy and other areas of Verity (Sweetgrass Spa, Member's lounge, Library, Computer area) to lounge in the chairs, hang out on the room's large private patio, have a drink at the private honor bar, or take a dip in the pool or bath (prepared with salts and tea preparations).  The concierge was available 24hrs and extremely kind and helpful in accommodating any of our needs or desires, altering our daily delivered breakfasts, making reservations and offering suggestions catered to our likes, and personally introducing us to the host at George Restaurant before our reservation.  We cannot say enough good things about the Ivy\\u002FVerity\\u002FSweetgrass Spa, where you can find every amenity at high quality, spectacular service, and a beautiful ambience.  It is private but alive, and suited for a getaway, for business, and for romance.  With an entrance through Verity, as well as a private entrance (with secure coded door) for the rooms, a guest can customize his\\u002Fher stay.  The location was central to many places such as a few blocks from the subway, or a walk to St. Lawrence Market\\u002FDundas.  We cannot wait to return and could have enjoyed many more days at the Ivy at Verity!  Thank you for a wonderful experience",
            "We just spent one blissful night at The Ivy at Verity. Could have stayed longer but the hotel was fully booked for the rest of the week. However, even the one night was enough for us to enjoy the wonderful surprises that this hotel offers. This place is a piece of heaven, when you enter the hotel through the Club \\\"Verity\\\" you are transported into another dimension, where your every wish is fulfilled. Our room was tasteful as it was beautiful, colors that soothe, bed linens that feel like \\\"cloud 9\\\", nothing missing or lacking. Best of all, we get to use the facilities of Verity's Sweetgrass Spa, and wine & dine at \\\"George\\\" Verity's 5-star restaurant, all under the same roof. After one night I am refreshed and rejuvenated, as if I spent a week at a resort. A place like this is hard to find, lucky for me I found it. Can't wait to return",
            "The Ivy at Verity is actually four lovely rooms within a private club for women, although they are available to anyone.  The rooms are large, beautifully presented, immaculate, and comfortable.  The bathroom was large and impressive.  One minor flaw (if you are a reader) is that the lighting is very low.  While not unpleasant it does make it a bit difficult to read once the drapes have been pulled.  During the day the large windows let in plenty of light.  The staff is about as accommodating as it is possible to be.  Breakfast is presented in the public room just outside the four separate guest rooms on trays that are then taken to one's own room (where there is a table and chairs perfect for eating).  Generally it is a continental breakfast, but it is possible to order some additions if one wishes.  There is a pod-style coffee maker available at all times, and while sweeteners are provided there was no milk or cream unless it was requested.  There is a small, private cafe\\u002Frestaurant within the complex that has a good, but limited menu, and another restaurant as well as a busy pub within the two adjacent buildings.  While there is no valet or in-house parking, there is a public lot immediately across the street.  The parking is metered (and expensive) but very convenient.  Just east of Yonge Street it is a bit out-of-the-way, but still only a few blocks to the Eaton Center.  It was easy to get a taxi to travel to the other parts of the city, or a short walk takes you to the Metro.  Cheap it was not, but very pleasant",
            "Great hotel, a nice surprise actually. Great location, easy to walk to main attractions in the city. The hotel is really unusally situated in an office building. The rooms are large and most likely recently furnished. Service was really good. Only downside is that some of what they offer, like gym, is women only.",
            "We stayed here for an evening and had dinner at George restaurant.  What a fabulous experience.  If you are travelling to Toronto, it is walking distance to the financial district, Yonge Street, the Eaton Center shopping mall and great restaurants.  The room was sooo cozy, heated flooring, spacious bathrooms with various scented bath salts, contemporary design.  The breakfast in the morning was right outside the door and we enjoyed eatting in bed.  Dinner at George was AMAZING.  The food, the service were top notch.  I highly recommend it.  There are only a few rooms, each one is decorated differently.  The spa though is women only, so sorry guys. If you are looking for a boutique hotel that is cozy, in a great location and can splurge, Verity is for you",
            "We chose the Ivy's Urban Retreat package for one night as a way to celebrate our anniversary in Toronto. In the city, there are no shortage of luxury hotel options, but it can be difficult to find a place to stay that is really in the \\\"boutique\\\" category while offering privacy, luxury, fun, and peace while away from home. In just about every category for evaluation, the Ivy excels. This 4-room hotel downtown stands out and above other options in Toronto, and we're thrilled to have discovered it.\\n\\nYou can request a particular room when booking, and we chose room #2. With a calming colour scheme, plenty of space, a gorgeous marble bathroom (deep tub and huge shower room!), and a large flat screen with a blu-ray player, it's well-outfitted, comfortable, and very quiet. You have access to a refreshments area with honour bar and complimentary soft drinks, as well as access to the members only lounge area, which we didn't make use of. Their packages have incredible value, and we had the chance to enjoy an included five-course meal at the onsite George restaurant and an hour long massage at the onsite Sweetgrass spa. \\n\\nTo clarify some confusion amongst the reviews and elsewhere, Verity is the parent company here and responsible for the spa and restaurant, as well as the hotel. The spa (and this includes all available fitness facilities) is women only, but this absolutely does not mean that men are somehow unwelcome. In fact, should you wish, men can request in-room spa services. As a male guest, I absolutely loved my stay here, and my partner was able to make use of the beautiful spa facilities. \\n\\nToronto seems to be a city where it can be difficult to feel as if value matches cost for accommodations. The Ivy at Verity bucks this unfortunate trend and offers an experience we hope to someday return for",
            "Got a chance to stay at Ivy in colourful Room 3 (each of the 4 rooms is different in size or decor) on a Saturday night.  Pure bliss!  Huge bathroom with separate room for the toilet and separate large shower stall and huge soaker tub with choice of scented bath salts.  High-end Hastens bed, swivel wall-mounted flat screen large TV, desk, 2 upholstered chairs, overstuffed armchair, ottoman, actual balcony facing peaceful courtyard (over George restaurant), and complimentary continental breakfast (coffee ready to order) and honour bar (several full-size bottles but no gin; two kinds of wine and assorted beers kept on ice) available just outside the room for in-room enjoyment.  \\n\\nBeing a Saturday\\u002FSunday, the business centre\\u002Flibrary area of the private women's club upstairs was empty and the concierge said I could use it.  Although the gorgeous basement-level pool, hot tub, and spa area is women-only, I still recommend this place to couples if the man can skip that part.  We got the urban one-night getaway package, so a 4 course tasting menu at George was included.  The service at George was a little rough -- we weren't offered any upgrades or wine pairings and the amuse bouche and first two courses came out too quickly --  we hadn't even received our aperitif cocktails yet!\\n\\nIvy is significantly cheaper than staying at Hazelton but now that I've stayed overnight at both, I would choose Ivy again and again.  The only difference is the slightly smaller closet space at Ivy compared to the two-sided closet\\u002Fstorage area in Hazelton rooms, and the lack of a TV in the bathroom at Ivy.  Otherwise the room setup and comfort quality is the same.  Ivy provides Bulgari white tea scented toiletries along with the choice of 3 scented bath salts.  Hazelton provides a fridge in-room stocked only with wine products and teas whereas Ivy gives many choices just outside the room and a free breakfast (Ivy continental included 2 kinds of croissants, jam, apple strudel slices, an interesting coconut oatmeal porridge that tasted great at room temperature, fresh berry fruit salad, choice of orange or grapefruit juice, and hot tea or coffee on demand.)  Yes, Hazelton does room service and has a restaurant open for brunch on site, whereas George at Ivy does not provide that flexibility.  The indoor pool at Hazelton was a huge disappointment (no windows, awful lighting and no relaxation area around the pool) whereas the women-only pool at Ivy is lovely and even has an underwater treadmill!  Queen Street East between Church and Jarvis is no Yorkville.  But for $200+ less on average per night, Ivy offers better value at a similar standard",
            "I stayed at the Ivy in November and it was wonderful! The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated and so serene. I especially love the bathroom, and the special touch of the bath salts \\\"buffet\\\". After a night out at the nearby distillery district, we enjoyed decadent desserts from George in the comfort of our room. The service was great. This was my 3rd time at Ivy and I expect I will return again",
            "The Ivy is a hidden gem in the centre of Toronto.  Spacious beautifully decorated rooms, luxurious linens and the bathrooms are stocked with the best toiletries - a deep bath and separate shower stall.  You  feel pampered and regenerated.  Great dinner package options at George restaurant and spa options at the spa. Small and personal - treat yourself",
            "Spent a wonderful weekend in Toronto at The Ivy at Verity.  A boutique hotel with just 4 rooms. Our was beautifully decorated, spacious with an amazing bathroom.   They have thought of everything -- honor bar, round the clock concierge and unique touches like freshly brewed tea to enjoy while you soak in a huge tub soaking in specially chosen bath salts.   It was a truly magical experience.   Can't imagine every staying anywhere else in Toronto.   Book ahead so you won't miss out",
            "Stayed here with my husband and baby while attending a wedding at the connected George Restaurant below the hotel. Both hotel and restaurant were exceptional. Only regret is that I didn't take a bath in the beautiful tub. The bath salts laid out looked truly divine! My husband could not get enough of the big shower.",
            "This hotel is centrally located inside a building that houses many different businesses.  There are only four rooms, but are they nice.  We would enjoy staying here again.  The staff particularly Roger was super.  This place is an oasis in the city.  Only downside is parking is in the lot across the street and is about $25 per day.  It is a bit hard to find as it is next to George Restaurant and there is only a small sign",
            "We absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was so welcoming and helpful. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was perfect. \\nThis hotel is owned by the women's club and was originally used exclusively by the club for when they had guests in town. Now anyone can book a room if you are lucky enough to nab one. There are only four rooms in the entire hotel and they are separated away from the rest of the club so it is very quiet. The rooms are very large with a king bed and beautiful full wall windows with a door onto a private balcony. Each room is color coded and unique. the bathroom comes with heated floors, a separate room for the toilet, an amazing shower, and the largest bath tub I have ever seen. I am 6'2\\\" and I could stretch out in the tub with room to spare. The added bonus is the in house made bath salt that they provide in three different scents.\\nYou also get breakfast delivered to your door. It is not a large meal but it gets you through to lunch. \\nThe last thing I have to say is that you MUST have dinner at George while you are there. This restaurant specializes in tasting menus for all dietary plans. The biggest benefit is that after your three hour multi -course meal you just have to walk up the hidden staircase to your room (never leaving the building). \\nI will definitely stay here again if ever back in Toronto",
            "we had a wonderful stay and George restaurant is awesome - the ambiance was spectacular and our room was intimate and very quiet - the access to the spa services was a great addition to the enjoyment of our sta",
            "We live in Toronto and were celebrating- my birthday, my husbands birthday and my best friend's and her husband's birthday all fall within a month of each other, so we decided this year to celebrate in style- a night at the Ivy. We kicked things off first at the Sweetgrass spa (for women only) then enjoyed a 10 course tasting menu on George's beautiful courtyard patio.\\n \\nGoing with another couple allowed me to gawk at their room too (room #1). I love how this hotel has only four rooms and all are tasteful and elegant, and so different. Our room (#3) was a glamorous blend of modern mixed with classic timeless materials, a nod to their chocolate factory past. Gorgeous blue wallpaper is charming against the relic brick of a bygone era. The rooms themselves are massive, much roomier than any other downtown hotel I've seen. With different seating areas to recline and relax, including a sunny deck that faces George's patio, my husband and I loved every minute of our stay. The bathroom has a super deep soaker tub and inviting aromatic bath salts- they have clearly anticipated your every thought! \\nOne feature I loved was the Samsung tablet that you use to control the television, but also acts as a portable TV, which they have linked to Netflix...cue the Orange is the New Black marathon! \\n\\nMy bestie's room was an intimate portrait of a Parisian hotel, soft pink striped wallpaper was welcoming and warm. Her room was every bit as luxurious as mine, every detail carefully constructed. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back, absolutely adore the staff, spa and restaurant here. It's a rare gem in a city full of over-done, over hyped hotels (IMHO). Nice gestures like the honour bar and delicious complimentary breakfast are just the finishing touches to a spoiled brat weekend. Thanks Ivy",
            "We always like to stay in what we call small luxury hotels or special places. The Ivy is both. In the hart of a former chocolate factory you find a hotel space that is very special. Great design, fine materials, very quiet airco, fine linen, great shower, lots of space for your clothes and bags. And breakfast is served in your room! At 08.00 it is outside your door, get it in and enjoy all you ordered the evening before. Very nice and helpful staff",
            "The Ivy at Verity is a tiny hotel. The set up seems odd at first... it is an exclusive women's club with gym, spa, library, lounges etc, and tucked away on a upper floor, the 4 lovely and spacious guest rooms.  The rooms overlook a court yard and face the windows of an ad agency, where you can see folks working away. At first it felt a bit like we were in a bedroom at work. We kept our drapes closed and all was well. As a woman, all of the amenities were amazing. I think if I had been travelling with a male companion it would have been disappointing.  I was in room three and it was BEAUTIFUL.  Just my style. Very comfortable king bed, incredible bathroom with an irresistible bathtub. All of the soaps and salts and lotions were really lovely and great quality. The room had lots of plush seating, and huge balcony. The honour bar, just outside of the rooms was a really nice touch - although when I was there it was not properly stocked and was never replenished, even after two calls to the concierge. Location is central enough to walk downtown, has a transit stop right out front, and there is paid parking directly across the street. I thought the breakfast was quite good. This will always be my first choice hotel when I stay in Toronto, I really loved it",
            "We had an excellent time here. The massage package with the room for two can be used by one person for the full hour by a RMT therapist. The breakfast consisted of coffee, a choice of freshly squeezed juice, pastry's, fresh fruit offered on a tray outside of your room. They have a small area to sit or you can bring your tray to your room.\\nThe hallways are so confusing of how to get to your room or even how to get to the reception area, although they were very accommodating to help you find your way. It was a nice treat with the spa downstairs for the following day.\\nVery close to the Eaton Centre. A great part of the city. It truly was a welcomed treat",
            "My wife & I stayed 1 night after dropping our daughter off at the airport.  I booked the hotel & knew that it was locate in a women's club.  I didn't think that this would be an issue but as a man, I never felt completely comfortable there.  Basically, I was an interloper, not able to use the gym, massage must be in-room, etc.  The room itself was very nice. It was very large and very open, not what I would call cozy or relaxing.  We also ran into an issue with the television.  Basically, it didn't work.  After much trying the young woman at the desk got it reconnected but we were never able to access HBO which is what my wife was hoping for.  Breakfast was not bad but was not particularly filling.  All in all, not a bad stay but not one that I'd repeat, particularly give  the cost",
            "This hotel is amazing!  Concierge are very helpful and informative. Room 4 was very large, beautifully decorated with a balcony over looking the courtyard.  Lovely bathroom with bathtub, separate shower and heated floor.  Three types of scented bath salts are available for your bathing pleasure!  An honour bar is available with red and white wine and a selection of spirits.  Continental breakfast, including in house freshly baked croissants is left outside your door at 8am.  \\n\\nDinner is highly recommended at the award winning George Restaurant!\\n\\nI give this hotel 10 out of 10!  Can't wait to go back",
            "Room could not have be nicer or more comfortable.\\nI wanted to give all top reviews becauae of this ....but a few things lacking.\\nService was average, there are other things in the building womans club,gym,spa so hotel service was a bit off. Like last on list.\\nThe breakfast was placed so nice, but was not really up to par. Juice and fruit good,but breads were a bit tough with no where to heat. Forgot our turn down service two of the four nights (there are only four rooms) \\",
            "My husband had an in- room massage, I relaxed in the spa, before our wonderful dinner at George. Back in our luxurious room, later that evening, we enjoyed a brandy and watched a light snow falling on our terrace.  A magical birthday getaway. Can't wait to go back",
            "This hotel is part of a small, elegant upscale spa and restaurant complex and women's club. The restaurant is superior as are the spa facilities and the rooms.  Decoration is in impeccable taste in every part of the complex.  The beds are British--Hypnos is the brand.  They are ultra-luxury in price; more importantly, they make for an exceptional sleep. We had a perfect escape to an elegant oasis in the middle of Toronto in the winter.  Highly recommended",
            "Amazing getaway in the heart of Toronto.  Great location, only four rooms in the entire hotel, gorgeous boardrooms, library, balconies.  The hotel rooms are enormous, luxurious, romantic and spotless.  The spa downstairs is just for women (which was kind of wonderful) but the male half of a couple might feel a little left out.  Then he should remind himself that he gets paid more than his wife does to do the same job\\u2026 and go relax in the giant bathtub instead",
            "Love this place, love Toronto.  Been here 3x in the past year and will be returning soon.  Beautiful retreat.  Wonderful to walk downstairs to George for dinner, to the spa for a massage, or up the street to the subway to get around the city.  Staff is first rate, attentive, and respectful of my privacy. It's expensive but the price is fair",
            "I wouldn't have even known this was their unless we were staying there as part of a wedding party, but it was truly a special little oasis in the city.  The room was massive by inner city standards.  There was a king size bed, little sitting are for reading and another one with a little table for eating\\u002Fdrinks.   There was also a large patio with a table overlooking a quiet courtyard.  Never once did it sound like we were in a city.  The bathroom was also huge and had a great assortment of quality soaps including 3 different scents of bath salts.   Room included a continental breakfast.  There also was an open area outside the room with complimentary soft drinks and cocktails for fee.  Would highly recommend this quiet, gem in the city",
            "A Gem in a perfect location. Where do I begin. I was greeted by a super nice and friendly staff. I was early for an appointment but interested in my wedding possibly there. I met with planner immediately who was a sweetheart. Just for any thinking about a wedding there, the prices can't be beat!  When I returned I was taken up to my room. The hotel is so lush, with velvet, satin,art work, a library and lounge. One of my favourite features is the honour bar which has inexpensive drinks, free pop, and a espresso coffee machine and tea. The best part was it was right out my bedroom door. The continental breakfast was just the right amount and delicious. The room was just WOW!  It was huge and the wonderful scent from the bath crystals was light yet a delight to the senses. The fixtures were unusual and very artsy. The bathroom was huge! Everything was soft and plush from towels, bedding and bath robes. I only had the pleasure of one night so not enough time to explore all the hotel and neighborhood had to offer. The menu was on a tablet, unlike some hotels where they are a bit used and messy. If you needed something, a friendly staff member was there quickly. I really can't say enough about this wonderful hotel and staff!  Thank you for an amazing night",
            "Stayed in room #4 for one night. Concierge was so accommodating- helped with parking and showing us all the ammenities. \\nThe room was spacious and beautiful. Large patio. Complimentary bath salt bar over the spa tub, separate stand up shower and toilet rooms. \\nThe hotel also had a bar for guests in a small sitting area outside the room. It worked based on the honesty system- each drink you had you recorded and were charged 6$\\u002Falcoholic beverage at the end of your stay. They had wine, beer, and all sorts of hard liquor + mix. \\nThere was a complimentary continental breakfast waiting on a table outside your room starting at 715- and when you were ready you called the concierge to bring a pot of fresh coffee. \\nOverall lovely, romantic spot. We also purchased the 4 course tasting menu at George which was amazing. Will return!",
            "Great hotel, unique experience. Highly recommended. George Restaurant was also amazing. Friendly staff, good breakfast and complimentary drinks all day. We also liked the spa, which is for women only. A bit weird neighborhood, but quite close to everything",
            "Definitely not your usual hotel. Looking for a home away your home.....This is the place where to go when you are in Toronto. Even if not located in some fancy neighborhoods, this place is a gem. At first a \\\"Women's club\\\" , the Ivy offers some rooms now... Mine was .. Yes ... awesome. A large room with a large bed, a pretty big bathroom with for the first time ever of my life a bath salt \\\"bar\\\" ... Breakfast it serve at your door at the requested time. Might be a little bit light (missing some toasts and butter), ordered croissants and chocolate brioche and ends-up with a muffin with grapes   ... But this was good.\\nTeam is great ... I will highly recommend this place ... Especially if you are a woman ... Next time i will try the SPA",
            "The Ivy at Verity ( a private women's club in downtown Toronto) attached to 5 star dining at George Restaurant with it's own private courtyard patio.\\nPosh but cozy, exclusive but welcoming. So beautiful and stylish but with plenty of substance. The people are warm and helpful and the beds are Hastens so the best sleep ever acheived. There is a Verity spa (complete with hot tub, steam room, and sauna ) on property called Sweetgrass that is exclusive for women but men staying in the hotel can have treatments in their hotel room. They even have fitness facilities (again, exclusive to women)  and you can add on a yoga class if you want for a nominal fee.\\nFabulous stay, incredible bed, God is here, in the deails",
            "This boutique hotel is exactly that. Small, but beautifully put together. Staff were all fantastic. Rooms perfect. Best bathrooms we've found in Canada, and when the weather allows a lovely veranda to sit on. Attached is a ladies health club and spa, and if I lived in Toronto I would join. Can you start one in England  - preferably near where I live \\uD83D\\uDE04 Husband and I had a champagne breakfast to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was lovely",
            "You owe it to yourself ( and to your spouse) to go on quick getaways and this Spa is ideal for that purpose. With Only 4 rooms it does require a bit of planning but once you have been whisked to iour private paradise, the biggest problem will be to get your better half to leave the room ! Starting with a show piece Hastens bed,  Italian linens  your ill undoubtebly have the best sleep of your life! A Wall of windows and french doors open up to  a gorgeous  indoor courtyard. ( I guess a summer visit is required), .\\nWe have now been spoiled for any other hotel room ever again!\\nWe will be back hereoften, often,  often and we look forward to trying George, the restaurant on the main floor.",
            "If you like plush  guesthouses then this is for you. Big rooms, beautiful big bathroom and not far from the nicer parts of town. Extensive basics \\u002Fservices are explained to you upon arrival and so you do feel like you're in a plush guesthouse rather than a efficient luxury hotel. The mini bar and breakfast area (even for in room breakfasts) are in a small shared space. The reception is one of those low down desks hence the guesthouse\\u002F plush b&b feel. Men cannot use any of the spa facilities, not even the gym :( Great for a traveling business woman who spends a lot of time in plush hotels and wants a more the social experience you would get in a b&b\\u002Fguesthouse.",
            "I am amazed by just how relaxing one night in the city actually was.  \\n\\nBut the bed is lovely.  And the aqua wallpaper in #3 is soothing.  And the design, in general, is excellent.  And the bathroom is exquisite (with great soaps and the like).  And they have this nice internal lobby where there's an honour bar and a Nespresso machine, which is actually where we enjoyed our dessert from George.\\n\\nI would've loved to stay for longer (though, well, it's not exactly a cheap stay), and I would've enjoyed the possibility of a massage.  I kind of wish I could stay here more often.  Shame it's not dog-friendly, and shame that the parking isn't included.  But these are definitely minor",
            "What a gem of a hotel.  Beautiful decor, impeccably maintained, and can't say enough about the most comfortable bed we've ever experienced.  The bathroom has heated floors, and the scent of homemade bathsalts (lavender, jasmine and eucalyptus) permeated through to the bedroom.  Would definitely stay there again",
            "Strange setting, 4 room hotel inside a women's only networking club in central Toronto.\\nSet in a beautifully renovated industrial complex, the room was a treat to the senses, salts for the bath, special wood floors in the bathroom. Everything about the room was perfect. We also had a beautiful little terrace overlooking a courtyard where we had breakfast.\\nThe affiliated George restaurant was also magnificent, and all the staff was attentive and knowledgable.\\nI loved the place.\\nI'll definitely go back",

            "To start off, the reception greeted me with smiles and hospitality.  The room was extremely clean and set up with bath salts and nice music.  The bed was like drifting on a soft cloud.  The decor and art were stunning and well thought out.  I felt at home and much relaxed in this hotel and didn't want to leave.  Especially after an amazing massage done right in the convenience of my room.  The staff was extremely accommodating and allowed me a late check out, so I could soak in the tub with some lavender bath salts (tub big enough for two).  mmmm...\\n\\nI would return to this hotel at any opportunity I may have",
            "I found the Ivy on hotels.com. Thought it sounded unique and it is! Four gorgeously and differently appointed rooms. Huge bathroom with rain shower and deep soaking tub, including in-house-made, complimentary bath salts - a nice touch after a long day of walking. There is an honor bar with white wine, liquors, and soft drinks. Also tea bags and instant coffee. Continental breakfast is included and it is quite ample - yogurt\\u002Fgranola, boiled egg, croissant or muffin, juices, and coffee\\u002Fcream. Really nice.\\n\\nThe only difficulty that I encountered was a previously unannounced electricity outage one night from 10pm to 4am the following morning. WEIRD. A letter left in my room. No explanation. Battery lantern and flashlight provided. \\n\\nThe building is in a sort of run-down block of Queen St just a bit east of the better parts of Queen St West. But I did not feel unsafe. \\n\\nThere is a great women's clothing store a few doors down. Don't miss it! And an excellent antiques store in the the next block east. Plenty of good restaurants a block or two away as well as the upscale George attached.\\n\\nLovely subterranean swimming pool and hot tub. And a spa",

            "We have completely enjoyed our week's stay at this hotel. The staff is excellent, friendly, professional, and helpful. The breakfasts are first rate and the snack suppers convenient when you don't feel like going out in the evening. The beds are comfortable, the water pressure in the showers is good and the water hot. We had plenty of room for the two of us and our Goldendoodle. There is a fine large lot behind the hotel that is lighted and perfect for the dog to do her business. The pool is a comfortable temperature and you can watch the planes come in from the clean and warm whirlpool. Most of the time when we ventured into Toronto we were traveling against the heaviest traffic so we think the location works for visiting the city. Yes, you can hear the planes but for us it became white noise. The hotel is doing renovations and just completed the Hearth Room where the meals are served. It is clean, beautifully decorated, and has a fireplace and comfortable seating. There is not one thing we didn't like about this hotel. We can highly recommend it. The only thing I would have changed is we would have gone to St. Lawrence Market on our first day and bought some of that amazing food to cook for dinners",

            "We stayed here while picking up a family member in the airport.  We used the 888 number to reserve and not the direct line to the hotel.  We reserved a king suite with a rollaway bed.  Upon arrival noticed it was not in the room.  The front desk informed us they don't even have rollaway beds and couldn't understand why we were told that.  We were offered extra linens which we took as one of us had to sleep on the floor.  The girls were up to their eyeballs with problems it seemed as it was caribana weekend and the hotel was full.  We stayed downtown before and while it is a nicer property, for the price and breakfast for 4 we were happy.  I think being a Marriott the communication around the sleeping should have not have happened and perhaps free parking could have been offered for the false info.  It. Was also not a king bed as advertised but again, the value was great!! If traveling with more than 2 it is a good hotel.",

            "Due to our plane being quite delayed, we missed our connecting flight and this is where we were housed until the next day when we could fly out.  There was a free shuttle but the driver was exceptionally rude when a girl in about her late teens\\u002Fearly twenties was struggling to get her bag up the stairs and he chose to answer his cell phone while watching her.  The drive from the airport was quite quick and check in was welcoming and friendly around 10:45 pm.  We booked a return to the airport on the 6:40 am shuttle.  We were given a $20 dinner voucher by the airline but there is no restaurant open.  Instead, we could choose from their \\\"Market\\\" which consisted of frozen, microwavable dinners, Kraft Dinner (microwavable), instant noodles, chips, pop, ice-cream.  After a long day of travel, this is not \\\"dinner\\\".  The hotel and hallways look very worn and tired with carpet ripped and stains.  When we opened the door to the room, the smell that wafted out was remnants of many different guest's cooked meals that have lingered for a long time.  It was definitely enough to make me gag, literally.  The place is very dated and the shower leaked.  The bed was comfortable and the hotel quiet throughout the night.  The next morning, we skipped the breakfast and attempted to catch the shuttle.  We found that they shuttle had left early and we missed it.  We were scolded by the front desk that the shuttle has a tight schedule to keep but we showed her the time and it was definitely before 6:40 am.  She called them and they returned to pick us up.  Never would I ever stay here or any where near this hotel chain again",
            "From the minute we arrived and my daughter was offered as many cookies as her small tummy could manage by the check-in clerk, the staff could not have been more helpful nor polite.

Anyhow, the rooms are very new, clean and fitted out to a very high standard. The pool and fitness areas were also very neat and tidy, and there\\u2019s even an outdoor basketball court for those that still have some energy left after a long journey. High speed internet access and breakfast are also offered complimentary by the hotel, and on both counts the service provided was first class. We\\u2019ll definitely use the hotel again on future trips.\\",
            "Okay, so there were good and bad things about this hotel.  \\nThe GOOD.  \\n-staff was fantastic, from the cleaning ladies and maintenance guys up, everyone really went out of their way to make sure everything was okay.\\n-other guests, we met more than a few people at the hotel and everyone was very friendly, sometimes at the 'higher end' hotels people can be really snotty.\\n-the cleanliness.  I don't think I saw a speck of dirt.  And believe me, I look!  Corners of ceilings in the lobby to the claw feet on the tables in the hall, no dust.  Pretty impressive.\\nThe BAD.\\n-the room is smaller than you think it will be, it was adequate, but not what I expected.\\n-the sofabed...oh....my.  Seriously, if you love the people you travel with, you won't expect them to sleep on this hammock.  We padded it with the (hideous) coverlet and 3 blankets.  Didn't really help.  Also, the sheets they provide for it are see through.\\n-the blankets.  Before we realized that we'd need a blanket to pad the bed, we thought we'd need it to sleep.  Still not sure if they were made of velcro or sandpaper.  Had to go down and ask for the same blanket (duvet) that they put on the beds.  Luckily, I've already made my comment about great staff.\\n-pillows and bed.  How did they raise the floor like that?  Very hard.  Hard pillows?  Yes, both the feather and the foam.\\n\\nThe hotel has a VERY dated feel to it.  It reminds me of the 70's, when you'd travel with the whole family.  There's even a barbecue outside!  The pool is bromine, which is kind of a salt\\u002Fchlorine combo, it's okay, but pretty drying on the skin.  I expected the pool area to be full of kids, but it wasn't bad at all.  The gym is quite nicely equipped, pretty much all you need.  A wired free connection in the room for the laptop was really nice.  Driving distance to shopping\\u002Fgrocery.  The tuck shop (snacks and drinks) had a really nice selection that wasn't wildly overpriced like minibars can be.\\n\\nAll in all, I wouldn't stay there again unless I got a fantastic deal like I did this time.  The space wasn't worth it as I prefer more sophisticated hotels.  I wasn't left with a bad impression, not at all, but the hotel itself wasn't memorable at all",

            "If you are traveling to Toronto and have to stay at the airport then this is the place for you. The service is great, the staff are friendly and welcoming and the rooms are clean. Let's face it, no one wants to go to TO and stay overnight at the airport. So why to go somewhere that you feel welcome and at home",
            "This hotel really met my needs.  I was passing through Toronto meeting up with family before heading to Europe on vacation. We got a 2 bedroom, which had a pull out bed in the living room.  It was just what we needed. \\n\\nThe pool and hot tub are nice, and there was even a tennis court with a basketball net that was great for my nephews and niece. There are also complimentary computers for internet access near the lobby. \\n\\nIf you are looking to visit Toronto, this hotel is a bit far from areas of interest. It is close to the airport, offers a complimentary shuttle and parking is free. I would definitely recommend this hotel to others. In fact, we liked it so much we booked there again for our return two weeks later",
            "We love this hotel, very spacious, nice pictures and bathroom deco.  The view of the landing aircrafts is also a nice plus for couples who have young kids.  Highly recommend it. (not bad for someone who is very picky, along with picky family members who usually find reasons to disagree with my hotel choices :)\\n\\nIf you need to order Chinese food, Gourmet Express can deliver to the room, great food at very reasonable prices.\\",
            "Stayed here for 4 days. Great price! Ample parking space (they charge for it). Decent buffet and good staff. Room was comfortable. It is a half hour drive to downtown Toronto. There are good restaurant and grocery options around this property, and also a mall.",
            "Stayed here briefly before flying back West. This has great rooms, is just off the main hotel strip by Pearson Airport (YYZ) and the breakfast was not too shabby either. Very much recommended and I downloaded the Marriott app for my iPhone which made checking in and out a breeze",
            "Have stayed here frequently most recently twice in December 2013. The rooms are clean and spacious. The staff are great. Always friendly and very helpful.\\nMy only two complaints:1. They now charge $10  for parking which used to be included. Many others in the airport area like the Hampton\\u002FHomewood Suites on Eglington do not charge. 2.The breakfast is generally quite good but ends at 9 (or 930 on  weekends) and  we often miss it if we sleep in",
            "I have been to a couple inns near the airport for some reason or another and this has been by far the best service I have received.  The staff was very friendly and helpful no matter the time. There is a full breakfast served included at the hotel and they change the types of food offered every day I was there.  There is no restaurant or bar in the hotel but there are plenty within walking distance and they even have a full grocery delivery service to the hotel so you can use the fridge, microwave, stove and dishwasher in your room if you'd prefer.\\n\\nThe planes from the airport can still be heard but they're much quieter here as it's not on the main path like other hotels nearby.  We were on the third floor and after 21:00 there were no problems with noise level.  During the day you could hear the planes go by but it wasn't very loud to begin with.  We were on the South side of the hotel which faces the air traffic more than the North side and we had no problems.\\n\\nThe hotel room itself was very clean and spacious.  This hotel does allow pets but there is a charge to sanitize the room afterwards and each of the rooms with an animal are clearly marked.\\n\\nOverall I would say this is one of the best hotels I've stayed at in Toronto and it will be the one I book again any time I need a hotel near the airport.  Thank you for the great experience",
            "Used to stay at Stage West hotel but after having stayed once at the Marriott Residence Inn for business, it has become my preferred hotel in Mississauga. Here are some of the reasons:\\nVALUE:\\n\\u2022\\tFirst and foremost, great value for what you get. Last time I stayed there was with my wife and two sons and one girlfriend (my son\\u2019s, not me!) We stayed in one of the two bedroom suites, breakfast and a light super and free parking were included for a cost of $199.00 plus taxes! Below are listed some other benefits of staying there.\\nROOM:\\n\\u2022\\tHave stayed in both one and two bedroom, both very comfortable, fully equipped kitchen, separate bedrooms with TV\\n\\u2022\\tThe two bedroom has a fireplace and en-suite bathroom in each room. Great for two couples or family.  \\nAMENITIES:\\n\\u2022\\tBreakfast and light dinner provided, \\n\\u2022\\tSmall gym, pool and whirlpool. \\n\\u2022\\tSmall tuck shop with basics\\nLOCATION: \\n\\u2022\\t10 -15 minutes from Pearson Airport,  hotel has free shuttle\\n\\u2022\\tEasy access to highways, 401, 427, etc\\u2026..\\n\\u2022\\tWithin walking distance are numerous restaurants for all budgets, across the street there is a Boston Pizza, Jack Astor\\u2019s, Canyon Creek, Tuckers, if you walk a block or two there are several other chain restaurants\\nSERVICE:\\n\\u2022\\tCannot say enough about the exceptional service provided; especially by one of the front desk staff.  My son was flying in and was to meet us the Hotel. He failed to show up at the time we expected him, one of the front desk staff saw that we were still in the dining room long after everyone had left and came and ask if she could help. To make a long story short, she went out of her way to confirm my son had arrived in Toronto and then made arrangements to retrieve his lost luggage and get him to the hotel.  Wow!\\nCONCLUSION:\\n\\u2022\\tThis is not a full service hotel, there is no bar (there were beverages in the dining room that could be bought from the front desk). There is no restaurant other than breakfast room, but if you are looking for a very affordable, very comfortable accommodations particularly for a longer stay or with a larger group, you can\\u2019t go wrong staying there",
            "Arrived late after 10 pm. Very close to airport, didn't take long by taxi. We booked a two bedroom apartment. It had two washrooms, which was helpful. D\\u00E9cor was a bit dated but the  overall environment was homely. Quite good free breakfast",
            "I stayed in this hotel for two days . Firstly there is nothing around the hotel . Only few restaurants and nothing more to spend tiime. The closest shopping area is 10 minutes with taxi but you have to pay 25 dollars .\\nThe hotel room was nice especially for families with its kitchen equipment Bed is comfortable but when it comes to bathroom amenities and cleaniliness its lower then marriott standars. Especially there was a towel thorn from sides and I warned the front desk they said ohhh how can it happen but the other day it was still there . And after breakfast I warned front desk personally but until my stay finished the thorned towel was still there . \\nShortly It is a standard family hotel with no great luxury and with an avarage breakfast.And in the middle of nowhere . At the beginning it seems cheaper according to downtown hotels but i\\u015Ff you want to buy somthing or entertain you should pay a lot of taxi fares",
            "Very clean.  Nicely decorated.  Nice staff.  We got the last room supposedly.  Stopped in during a road trip.  Was advised by the AAA manual that this was a decent place to stay.  The price was originally 175.00 but reduced to 145.00 Canadian.  Serving party sandwiches for dinner that night-did not try but breakfast was a winner.  Lots of choices both hot and cold including sausage, eggs, toast, pastries, juice, coffee, etc.  Decent treadmill in the small exercise room.  My daughter loved the pool.  We enjoyed the basketball court outside.\\",
            "Just 5 minutes from Toronto Airport (complimentary airport transfer if required),  this hotel did not disappoint.  We were 4 adults and had booked a 2 bedroomed suite. It was spacious, immaculately clean with new furnishings and state of the art tv's in both bedrooms and sitting room.  The sitting room has a log effect remote control fire for cosy winter evenings and a  well equiped  kitchen which looked as though it had never been used.  With 2 ensuite bedrooms this apartment on the 9th floor (top floor) could easily sleep 6.  The breakfast was buffet style with plenty of choice and  complimentary coffee and  tea (make it yourself)  was available allday from the sitting area. The two men in our party made the most of the free internet service and I enjoyed the indoor swimming pool. All-in-all, this has to be one of the best airport stopovers we have ever had. \\nJune 17th 2006.  Jan & Brendan Lomax & Ann & Gordon Milne,  London .UK.\\",
            "The rooms were nice and open but the furniture is outdated. I thought the price was good. We got a 2 bedroom suite for 152 bucks for one night however on the receipt there was 3 separate charges for HST and another charge for 5 bucks which was ridiculous, in addition they charge 10 bucks for parking! so the room ended up costing 190 bucks! Thats a little outrageous. The eating area for the included breakfast is very tiny so be prepared to take your food to your room oh and its only available between 6:30am and 9:30am which is STUPID for a saturday. Its close to the airport so expect alot of travelers at the hotel it wasn't quite by any means. A suggestion to the hotel take that 10 parking fee you rip your customers off for and put it into a fund to level out your parking lot its horrible literally! One more thing id like to mention is that this is a residence inn therefor people are usually staying for an extended period of time so its a good idea to have sufficient utensils. Only provided one tiny steak knife! I did not find the staff accommodating, friendly or helpful in anyway. The lady that checked me in should maybe look for a job elsewhere because she was not warm in welcoming in anyway. I have stayed at many Marriott's and this is by far the biggest disappointment for a Marriott",
            "We stayed overnight in a 1 br suite when we went to Medieval Times.  We enjoyed the location and the facilities.  Our room had a small kitchen and dishwasher. Bed and Sofa bed was comfortable for our girls. The pool and the hot tub were very enjoyable. Breakfast in the morning was good and convenient. Staff was great and helpful.\\nWould return to this hotel every time in Toronto, attending consumer shows at the International center or when departing on trip from Toronto  Pearson Airport.\\nGreat value",
            "We always try to stay at Residence Inn when we are away from home for various reasons, which includes homely feeling, good breakfast in the morning and if needed ability to cook food. Toronto Airport Residence Inn is no different, its very nice place, very clean rooms, fully equipped gym, laundry facilities on 3 floors, good breakfast in the morning. Honestly I didnt find anything lagging anywhere. Only issue is, the place is bit far from downtown, but if you can put up with that, its fine. Since we had a car, we were ok. There is also free shuttle to the airport. There are restaurants in walking distance from the hotel so you dont need to drive. In all very pleasant stay, I also like seeing airplanes landing which was very nice. If you have issues with the very little noise of aircraft, then try to get a room on the other side of the building, but the noise for me is completely alright, its much subtle than other hotels I have stayed at. We will comeback, just dont know when. Keep up the good work",
            "If you're going to Toronto and plan to visit places like Canada's Wonderland, the Toronto Zoo, Ontario Science Centre, and even downtown Toronto, I STRONGLY recommend the Residence Inn by Pearson Airport. In summary, the positives were great customer service, nice amenities, the room was luxurious, and the free hot breakfast buffet was as good or better than anything you would find at a restaurant! The only complaints I have are that there is no wireless internet (although there is a wired connection in room or lobby computers) and it would have been nice if the bathroom weren't only accessible through the bedroom (but that is a fairly minor gripe and didn't impact our stay at all). You will not find better service, quality, or value in Toronto!\\n\\nWe, two adults and a 9 yr old, stayed for three nights in July 2011, and will absolutely stay here again if we return to vacation in Toronto again. Our rate was $92 a night plus $8 for parking each night. However, when you factor in the free breakfast for three, the nightly cost goes from $100 to $75. The only other place you will find a price like that are the cheap motels where you don't get anywhere close to the quality offered at Residence Inn.\\n\\nThe location is great as you are just off of the 401 which you will use to get to most major attractions. It's tucked away and not on a busy street. It's by the airport so you will see airplanes, but I couldn't hear them and our room was at the end of the building facing the airport. The area is littered with restaurants! Moxies, Lonestar, Tony Romas, Montannas, Boston Pizza, and the Keg, just to name a few! There is a lacking in fast food and other retail, but having a great deal of choice when it came to dinner was a welcomed feature. \\n\\nThe hotel is well maintained and very clean. The basketball court was a nice plus; the swimming pool was medium sized but never felt crowded (and we went swimming at least once a day); the spa was nice because our kid could actually go in it (both the pool and spa were salt water, too); the parking lot was never crowded; there's an outdoor patio with BBQ for the guests to use; and I never found the halls to be noisy. There was always the latest newspapers available in the lobby, the staff posted a detailed weather forecast in the lobby, and two computers with a printer so that you could stay connected to the internet. The staff were beyond excellent - we showed up before noon and asked if there was any possibility to check-in early and were accommodated without any hesitation and the front desk even called us five minutes later to make sure the room was to our liking! The one time late in the day when we found no towels by the pool the staff quickly supplied some. In general it felt like the staff were genuinely fantastic at customer service. \\n\\nThe room was very spacious. My only complaint is that I wish the bathroom wasn't only accessible through the bedroom but that's minor. Internet is only available through a wired connection but there's computers in the lobby. The temperature in the room was so good that even with the air turned off and the outside temperature surpassing 30 degrees Celsius each day, we were still comfortable. The kitchen comes completely stocked with everything you need to cook and eat - including salt and pepper shakers! There was even a welcome basket with microwavable popcorn! The appliances worked and were by no means outdated. The under-mounted stainless steel sink was VERY deep. The bathroom was nice although if you like deep bath tubs you won't find one here. The sofa bed was comfortable - perhaps more comfortable as a pull out bed than as a couch. The TVs were nice and the one in the bedroom was close to the end of the bed which made it easier to read. There was plenty of storage space (two dressers and a large closet) and lots of seating - including a very nice desk chair and the two dining chairs, as well as an arm chair in the living room. The bedding was also comfortable although I must have been allergic to the pillow or comforter filling. There were at least three different pillow types available. Another nice bonus was an ice-maker in the freezer. Overall, it was an amazing room!\\n\\nThe final thing I wanted to mention was the breakfast... the free hot breakfast buffet easily covered the cost of parking and was as good as anything you will find at a restaurant! The selection was superb and changed slightly each day. While we were there the selection included waffles, french toast, sausage patties, sausage links, scrambled eggs, potato pancakes, beans in tomato sauce, four types of cereal, a variety of yogurt, muffins, donuts, bagels, english muffins, toast, cinnamon buns, fruit salad, fruit, oatmeal, and much more! There's also a good selection of beverages - orange juice, apple juice, cranberry juice, and grapefruit juice, tea, coffee, and milk. There was also every appropriate condiment you would expect - such as, but not all inclusive, powdered sugar, granola, chocolate chips, syrup, cream cheese, six types of jam\\u002Fspread, even cheeze wiz. Needless to say, the breakfast was not just filling, but allowed you to pick up some snack options for later as you had the option of using disposable containers and cutlery. To add to the great spread, it was well maintained and someone was always there to refill the available food or pick up any plates you were done with. It was never too busy that we couldn't find a seat, but then again if it were that busy you could always take it back to your room and eat at your own table. If you show up a little late the selection may not be as good as around 7 am, but the one day we did show up late we still ate like kings! \\n\\nI was beyond impressed by this hotel and it's nice to know that there's still good value to be found in Toronto",
            "The price is right, the breakfast was healthy and service was attentive and polite. A great stay overall. They do charge for parking but it is one of  the lowest in the location. Even at the great rate, they did not skimp on lotions, soaps etc. They were all high quality. The owners should be proud of the staff they selected. Well run for sure",
            "We booked a 4 night stay while attending the CGTA & Mode Show.  We had read about the hot buffet breakfast but weren't expecting too much, so we were pleasantly surprised to find such a selection.  The light supper provided from Monday to Thursday evenings was also delicious - we felt like we were at an all-inclusive.  Suite was lovely, staff were extremely friendly and accommodating, couldn't ask for anything more",
            "We recently stayed at the Residence Inn for a girls hockey tournament.  Normally three nights in a basic hotel room with 2 Adults, 2 Kids, 2 Sets of Hockey Equipment etc.  is crammed and not very pleasant.  The rooms at the Residence were like mini apartments!  There was a full kitchen, a living room with pull out sofa bed, and a separate bedroom (with a door that shuts which is great for privacy) and the bathroom off of the bedroom.  On Thursday evening they had a free supper which on that night was soup and salads, but the menu shows chili, shepherds pie etc.  It was really good.  The continental breakfast is a hot breakfast which is also very good.  Housekeeping came in every morning and filled the dishwasher, ran it and then emptied it the next day --- awesome!   Upon getting home from our trip I realized I had left my reading glasses on the desk.  I called housekeeping and they did find them and Fedex'd them to me within two days --- Thank Goodness!  Overall a great stay and definately will look for Residence Inn whereever we travel in the future",
            "I did some research on this hotel on this site, and heard it was new- 2 years old. \\nThe rooms - marble tile bathrooms, new pillow top beds, new carpeting, nice view.\\nBreakfast - complimentary - scrambled eggs, sausage, potatoes, all continental items, waffles, pancakes - all complimentary\\nService - everyone from the front desk, to the breakfast help to housekeeping is friendly and do a terrific job. \\nAl in all, I can't think of a better hotel experience. They also have a nice fitness center, and pool.\\nYou are right by the airport (2 miles), can see planes landing, but amazingly , cannot hear them at all inside the hotel.\\",
            "Close to airport with a convienent free shuttle service.  There is a managers reception with ok food and a charge for beer wine.  A few close restaurants near by within walking distance of 1\\u002F2 mile.\\n\\nHotel staff was very friendly and attentative",
            "The suite was spacious and the bed was extra comfortable.  We could watch the planes landing from our windows but we did not hear the planes at all.  The full kitchen was complete and included utensils, dishes, pots & pans.  The only thing missing was an oven.\\n\\nPopcorn was also provided.  Supper is complimentary from Monday thru Thurday and it consisted of soup + pizza on the Thurday we were there.  They also have fresh baked cookies in the lobby.\\n\\nat $101 cdn per night this was excellent value for the area.  many restaurants one block away and half an hour drive from downtown Toronto, it was perfect for us.\\",
            "To be honest when I first came to this hotel I had absolutely no expectations and was a little disappointed in the exterior look of the hotel. However today is my last day and I can't tell you how amazing this stay has been and how incredible the staff here are during my time here. I've never been at a hotel where every single staff member from every area of the business is so wonderful and nice and happy. They always smile and say hello whenever we cross paths and that means so much when you're staying alone. Jason at the front counter I'd unbelievably friendly, helpful, and kind. I absolutely hope he gets recognized for his amazing customer service. The rooms are spacious, I loved the kitchen with microwave, fridge, freezer, and utensils! Makes it easy to bring and heat up any leftovers. The rooms are clean and well kept. I couldn't have asked for more during my stay here and I'll recommend this hotel to all my friends.",
            "Very clean, comfortable rooms, heated indoor pool, usual free breakfast with a nice variety of hot and cold choices.\\nShuttle to and from the the airport.  Good TV and internet available in room.  Comfortable lobby lounge.\\",
            "We stayed only one night at the Residence Inn before our flight out to Vancouver the next morning. Our check in took a little longer than expected but the complimentary cookies at the front desk made up for it. The suite had a kitchenette, dining area, living area, desk and seperate bedroom. The hotel is fairly new so everything was clean and the bed was extremely comfortable with a lovely duvet and plush pillows. The complimentary breakfast and internet were a definate plus! Would definalty stay there again.\\",
            "We reserved a 2-bedroom apartment for a long weekend for four adults and one child.  It was perfect with two bedrooms, each with a bathroom and a sleeper sofa in the separate living room.  The full kitchen with a table was well used and we prepared some meals.  The full-breakfast was one of the best complimentary we've had at a hotel.  The staff was always helpful and courteous.\\n\\nThe indoor pool and hot tub, were large and well maintained and the workout room while small was pretty good.\\n\\nThe hotel is near the airport so you have to drive a bit to the city but the airport shuttle was handy when arriving and leaving.  Overall, a great value for a clean and well maintained hotel",
            "In any given year I usually have several occasions to stay out by the Toronto Airport even though I live in the region....usually while attending conferences at the nearby Congress Center. In the past, my hotel of choice has always been the The Courtyard Marriott, and although it's not my favourite Courtyard, I am a strong supporter of the Marriott brand and that hotel has served my needs - however.......on this occasion the Courtyard was sold out and I ended up booking the Residence Inn - what a lucky break!!\\nThis hotel was a stand out from the moment I walked through the doors - the lobby exuded warmth & charm, the front desk staff were welcoming and cordial and the check-in process was easy. I had a one bedroom suite which included a sitting area, separate bedroom, comfortable work area, fully equipped kitchen with eating area, two flat screen TV'S , separate dressing area and nice bathroom. The room was spotlessly clean,  the bed super comfortable and the shower  divine with excellent water pressure. There is a small gathering room, complete with fireplace & T.V. in the lobby where they serve an included full breakfast every morning and evening snacks from Monday to Wednesday. There is also a small market stand where you can buy chips, snacks and frozen entrees for your room. The hotel will also do a grocery run, upon request, and charge to your room. If cooking in your room is not your style then there are a myriad of excellent restaurants within walking distance of the hotel. There is a nice sized indoor pool, basic workout room and outdoor basketball court. The only update that I think this hotel would benefit from would be the introduction of a small bar in the evenings - the one advantage that, in my mind, the Courtyard has over the Residence Inn. My recent stay was only for  three nights but I would have been perfectly happy to have stayed three weeks - I was that comfortable! This is my new \\\"go to\\\" hotel - paradise at Pearson",
            "Last Christmas vacation me and my family stayed in their on of kitchenette suites and we found very enjoyable and great services. Morning breakfast was too goo with too many varieties. We stayed in this hotel because it is very convenient to all our relatives and friends places.\\nThanks and we back again",
            "Second time at this hotel for a hockey tournament and we'll be back next month too. Spacious rooms, some with full kitchens. Our two bedroom suite was ideal. The included breakfast leaves a  little to be desired but it got us fed before we left for the rink. Pool and outdoor basketball court help keep the kids amused. Many restaurants within a kilometre and access to the 401 is a minute away",
            "I just got back from Toronto for business and my company booked us at this hotel for \\n4 days. Great hotel! Everyday there was a free breakfast. The rooms had full size appliances in the kitchenette, had a living room with TV, separate bedroom with TV, a separate area off the bedroom with a large sink area, and a separate bathroom with toilet and shower. It looked to be just remodeled. It was one of the nicest rooms I have stayed at and also comfortable. I would definitely recommend this hotel if you are travelling to Toronto. Pool, hot tub and exercise room also. The staff were very friendly and helpful",
            "My family and I booked a 2 bedroom suite at this airport hotel and I was a little leery due to some of the negative reviews, but when we walked into our suite everyone went ...hmm nice... The fully equiped kitchen had granite countertops and ceramic tile floors as did the 2 bathroms in our suite. The beds were very comfortable and with 3 tvs in the suite we all watched what we wanted in complete comfort. At $230 per night for this luxury suite along with a hot breakfast made this a great value. The service was very sincere and friendly and we really could not have asked for more",
            "Booked a last minute family trip for the weekend. Great hotel, wonderful full All-American breakfast included. Clean, modern, courteous staff. Wished they had free parking. Otherwise absolutely nothing to complain about. Kids were confortable in the two room suite which has full refridgerator, range, dishwasher, micowave and coffee pot. Noticed the night before check out that they also offer free grocery shopping. Grocery is billed to your room. Wish I noticed before, traveling with 3 young kids we would have certainly taken advantage of this. Also coin operated washing machines. The kids also enjoyed that the pool stayed open until 11pm. Perfect for relaxation at the end of our daily adventures",

But beyond all of that, the staff are the winners of this hotel. Well done and thank you",
            "This hotel is super nice. The building and the facilities are brand new. The room we stayed had a micro wave oven, dishwasher and utensils and complete dinner set for four. We never use them but they are there just in case you are the type who choose to cook your own food. The hotel will even do the goceries for you if you needed them. The staff are superb. I will not hesitate to recommend this hotel.\\",
            "We had a 2 Room suite that was quite large. Had a king size bed, stove, desk ,dishwasher, pots, dishes and all the utensils you would need if you where here for a long term stay. Also had a full size fridge and 2 flat screen TVs. Breakfast and airport shuttle where included in the rate. You can call for the shuttle on arrival and for the return to the airport just make a reservation at the front desk. They have an arrangement for you to park your car when you go away on holidays. We arrived by plane so we did not use this service. the only  thing I did not like was the hotel does not have a restaurant or a bar. We had to walk to the hotel next door to have lunch. There are restaurants nearby but when we arrived Sunday night most had closed early. It was very quiet inside the hotel even with flight going overhead we heard nothing. Good soundproofing",

The upside to that was the pantry\\u2019s cleanliness. Will definitely recommend this hotel to everyone",
            "I stayed here for 6 nights and it was lovely. The on-site parking, though a little pricey, was a huge selling point and very convenient. Just a block from the train station, there's a bodega across the street, and the staff was pleasant and competent. I would absolutely stay here again",
            "We booked a \\u201Cluxury suite.\\u201D  While it was spacious and had large windows, there was nothing luxurious about it. The place screamed \\u201Cdeferred maintenance.\\u201D  Furniture was old, tired, and uncomfortable. Extensive water damage in the bathroom. What was described as granite countertops were plastic. Everything about this suite screams \\u201Ccheap\\u201D from the poor quality flooring to the tiny televisions. To make matters worse, the hotel has no gym, which I consider unacceptable in 2024. There is actually a gym in the building but the hotel has no arrangement for guests to use it. I am really regretting booking at this place",
            "We come with a group of 20+ people. The prices are really fair for the rooms we got. Spacious living room with a lot of facilities such as dish washer. Though it's a pity the balcony could not be accessed. Pool and gyms are closed due to the Covid. The staff were super helpful with the recommendations and even helped us to find agencies to book some trips. The service was fast when we needed something. Great location as well,  the street behind the hotel has a lot of restaurants and bars. Close to Eaton Centre",
            "This is an excellent accommodation for anyone seeking a little more room than what a standard hotel offers. Sure there are signs of wear and tear throughout, but the rates are excellent, and the rooms are so spacious. Also, the customer service was absolutely fantastic. All the staff we interacted seemed attentive and willing to go the extra mile to help their guests",
            "Location is fantastic, 5 minutes from bloor  and yonge and subway. The appartements are fully renovated with full kitchen. The staff is uber friendly and helpfull. The hotel is very clean and well maintained. Too bad that they are getting rid of the pool to build a gym. Good value",
            "Nice hotel. Good location. Comfortable bed. And clean and tidy. Staff polite and helpful (the tour firm they recommended for Niagara falls were great and reasonably priced. I even did the boat ride, which was spectacular. ) Some negatives: they clean the room every other day (maybe that is the norm); there were a few broken things in my room (one of the lights and the towel rail); the gym is private and needs to booked and paid for). The breakfast is minimalistic,  but suited me as I don't each much first thing in the morning.  I was on the 27th floor or what they call the PH floor. Overall,  I would consider it again",
            "My wife and I spent 5 nights here. The location was close to the gay village neighbourhood and high-end Yorkville Ave. We were able to walk to most things we wanted to explore. \\n\\nThe hotel room was a cute, cozy, and clean apartment. We had a full kitchen, living space, bedroom, and bathroom with a rainfall shower. It was everything we needed to have a relaxing space to enjoy after a long day of exploring. \\n\\nWe only used housekeeping once since we were only there a few days. If we requested clean towels or toilet paper from the front desk it was brought up in less than 5 minutes. \\n\\nA classic continental breakfast of muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit was provided each morning. \\n\\nWe stayed in a \\u201Cluxury king suite, one bedroom\\u201D booked through Hotels. ca and the room was wonderful. I\\u2019d stay here again",
            "Needed a simple room and got a nicely equipped suite. Very surprised when we walked into a suite that cost less than half of a single room. Heart of Toronto, walking distance to almost everything and yet quiet at night. Staff was amazing and very helpful.",
            "great staff, rooms are excellent, renovation in lobby is well done. complimentary breakfast was good and could be expanded. my first choose when staying in Toronto. close to everything, dining shopping. very easy to get to. staff were accommodating for a late checkout. the room upgrade was wonderful",
            "Suites are spacious, stylish and comfortable. Great location! Seems to be no daily room service but fresh towels were delivered to our door without delay when we asked one evening. Staff very professional and helpful.\\n\\nBe aware that they put a large security deposit on your credit card as if you are renting an apartment (which you basically are). Ours was $500 for a king suite",
            "I've been to various downtown hotels over the years and the rooms are often very small. I really enjoyed this condo-like \\\"suite\\\". Mine had a small kitchen as well as a living room area. Note that the hotel has different types of rooms.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the stay. I also found the bed to be very comfortable. The living room was nicely arranged. Really had an excellent time and would have happily stayed longer",
            "Fantastic place as your close to where you want to be.  After travel in 3 time zones from Hawaii, Houston and Toronto in one week this apartment hotel is a great place. When I do come back to Toronto this will be the spot to come to from now on as you have everything you need and food stores are a few blocks down the street.\\nI recommend staying at Town INN Suites when you visit Toronto",
            "We recently stayed at the Town Inn Suites.  Room were newly renovated, clean, tastefully decorated, spacious, comfortable, and well equipped.  Nothing was lacking.  Staff was cheery, friendly, and super helpful.  It was a truly wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend this place.  Also great was its perfect location to restaurants and shops",
            "I booked this hotel because others in the Yorkville Areo were extremely expensive. While the outside of this hotel doesn\\u2019t look exciting, I was very pleasantly surprised at the inside of the room. It looks like a chic simple New York City modern apartment.\\n\\nOnly con is the breakfast situation - at peak time (730ish - 830), forget about getting in there peacefully.  Better to go out on the streets for a pastry.   \\n\\nLocation is amazing.  Staff friendly",
            "This was my first time at town inn and everything was amazing. I was missing a pot in the kitchen, and I called front desk and they were very quick with bringing one straight to my room. Over all amazing experience and everything was clean. I will for sure be booking again",
            "We took a family suite at $400\\u002Fnight in Nov - parking an extra $30. The suite is well appointed, clean & comfortable. The hotel is very central in D\\u002FT Toronto everything is close. the staff is nice.\\nWhat it lacks is amenities - there is barely enough crockery & cutlery for 4 people, 2 cooking pans, 2 cooking utensils, no paper towels, no salt\\u002Fpepper, 2 tissue boxes, 2 sets of towels, 1 bar of soap for 5 people, coffee pods never replenished. I twice asked the reception for towels which never came. Toiletries were never replenished during our stay.\\nThe heater didnt work, which they came & fixed very quickly.\\nA good place but certainly not worth the price",
            "Beautifully renovated, still a few dings in walls etc but very clean. Very attentive staff and clean quiet rooms that look exactly like the photos. Breakfast is continental style but well stocked(except for missing sugar which was quickly rectified). Breakfast room is small so plan on  taking breakfast back to your suite. Location feels safe for a solo female traveller, and has a convenience store across the street. Bloor and Yonge are a short walk away.  \\nThe slippers are a lovely bonus. \\n\\nRegarding some reviews - Anyone who is a seasoned traveler should be aware that hotels do require credit cards. This is a long time well known practice and should not come as a surprise to anyone, it's not the hotels responsibility to inform you directly",
            "I had stayed at this hotel years ago, and I was aware that hotel had gone through renovations but did not know what to expect..  When I booked room originally there wasn't two double beds room available online.  When I checked I asked if one was available, the manager quickly looked into it, and was able to give me a suite, at nominal increase in price.  When I walked in the room I was totally surprised how beautiful it was.  It was very modern, clean, and comfortable, the suite was very large.  It had stove, microwave, dishwasher, where I made good use of the appliances, during my 4 day stay.  The cleaning staff was a very sweet lady, and accommodated me with towels, toiletry, dish washer detergent, etc, I had told her it was ok not to make beds etc, I would take care of it. The location is great spot, close to many amenities, restaurants, shopping, few blocks away from Bloor St.  Wi Fi was free, and used it a lot for work and leisure. I was pleasantly surprised of this hotel and will plan to visit there again",
            "I stayed in a suite here for 2 weeks while looking for somewhere permanent to rent. My suite was perfectly fine, not high end luxury but not budget either. It had quite a large kitchen and living space, a bathroom (with a shower but not a bath), and a separate bedroom. I wasn't here on holiday so it was nice to have some form of kitchen to cook with. The kitchen had most things you would need.\\n\\nThe bedroom was a little on the small side, partly because there was a huge king sized bed and not much room for anything else. The bathroom was nice, but I had some problems with the hot water in that I had to leave the shower running for 30 minutes sometimes before it got to a reasonable temperature to shower in. Since moving into a condo in Toronto I have the same problem, so I wonder if it's a common thing here.\\n\\nThe wifi was a little slow but functional. I had to sign in again every 24 hours which got irritating given I was there 2 weeks.\\n\\nI stayed here during the COVID-19 pandemic and I was self isolating here after arriving in Canada. The staff were mostly accommodating of this. The only issue I had was requests getting misinterpreted when calling down to reception for something, usually ending up in them bringing the wrong thing or too much of something which was wasteful. Because of the circumstances during my stay, the location made little difference. But if I were getting about, I think I might have found the location a little too far away from the centre",
            "Great central location, close to food, shopping. Overall good value for money, and recently renovated apartment suites. Front desk staff are friendly and professional. Underground parking is a bit pricey so suggest checking other nearby garages. \\n\\",
            "Had to review! Stayed twice in 1 week, seeing 2 rooms, 1 with kitchen and 1 without. Both were perfectly clean, spacious, well decorated and comfortable.  The staff was very helpful; you got the impression, they all wanted to make sure your stay was the best it could be. Parking ($30 per night) was a little pricey, but easy to use and very convenient, appreciated. The atmosphere on colourful Church street and the convention shops surrounding the hotel greatly added to our seamless, stress free stay. You\\u2019ll definitely feel safe.  Across the street and south 100m is a great coffee shop in the morning and a pub in the evening, providing a perfect start and end to your day.  Do not hesitate to stay at this hotel, period",
            "Really enjoyed my stay here. The suites are quite spacious and I really enjoyed having a full kitchen with COVID and all\\u2026 The staff were friendly and super helpful when I needed some recommendations. Looking forward to my next visit here",
            "Very comfortable accomodation to explore Toronto and not to far to Niagara falls! Cooking & washing facilities! There is even breakfast available! A lot of restaurants & shops nearby and the Subway station is only 5 min to go! Very friendly & helbful staff",
            "The Place is close to Downtown.  This neighborhood is known as \\u201Cgay Village\\u201D.  It\\u2019s not a problem for us, but some may don\\u2019t like.  People from the hotel were very nice.  In fact, our suite was a huge apartment complete, with 2 bed rooms, kitchen And 1 bathroom.   No breakfast.   Ideal for familys and thouse who travel in small groups",
            "I arrived early and in the rain. I was able to store luggage, check in early and helped find the museum by the very friendly front desk staff.\\nMy room with a king sized bed was clean and comfortable. I loved having my own kitchenette.\\nThe view was lovely and I will definitely stay again",
            "I cannot say enough about the amazing staff here. Check in and out is easy. The staff are polite, professional and efficient. I overbooked as I was coordinating for family members and they released the extra room with no penalty and no questions asked. Value for money is synonomous with the Town Inn Suites in Toronto, especially at a time when hotel stays have really sky rocketed. This still feels afordable without sacrificing expectations for clean and comfy stays. Having the extra room of a kitchen\\u002Fliving room and a one bedroom was perfect with multiple wedding guests staying here. The continental breakfast was great - croissants, yoghurt and lots of coffee in a clean dining area. There is parking (extra fee) and a an easy in\\u002Fout drive so that checking in and dropping luggage is a breeze. This is a great place to stay when in TO and not far from key areas of interest. We stayed here a few years ago at Christmas also and happily the consistency from then til now is noteworthy",
            "We had a really excellent stay. The room was clean. The hotel manager and his staff are so friendly and efficient - they are like a family. Excellent location downtown. Everything you will need is in the apartment and the kitchen is fully equipped. The Wifi is fast and reliable. Would definitely recommend this place",
            "Clean, comfortable and practical accommodation, just as shown in the photograph. Personable check-in staff. We enjoyed a quiet night's sleep. Suite was well-equipped with fridge, stove, toaster, dishes, dishwasher, etc. for eating in. Good space in our suite for sitting together with friends who stayed in an adjacent suite. I would not hesitate to choose Town Inn Suites in future",
            "Nice location, walking distance to street cars, restaurants. Staff were friendly. They are very welcoming at the reception, unlike at the hotel we went for an overnight stay in Montreal. Didn\\u2019t expected the complimentary breakfast which is nice and not in a bag. Fresh croissants. Amenities in our room is good",
            "Went to spend a week-end In Toronto and came across this fabulous place, booked on line. The front staff service was amazing , very happy and welcoming staff. Our room was beautiful, King size bed with Fully equipped Kitchen , living room. Our room was very clean ,everything we needed was there, such an amazing place , parking is on premises , and breakfast offered is across the street. The pool was not opened at this time, understanding, but look forward to our next visit. amazin",
            "We booked this hotel at the last minute, which is not normal for us but we had some circumstances that made it necessary.  This is the most we've ever paid for a room. $290 per night Canadian,  There were plenty of great things about the hotel, especially the location that was convenient to Toronto's wonderful public transportation system and good walking as well.  There were supermarkets nearby.  The desk staff were friendly and I appreciated that they wore masks.  It was handy to have a kitchenette in the room and the bed was notably comfortable.  Trips of 5 nights or more came with a free airport pickup, which worked as planned.  The shower was good with plenty of hot water.  I liked that they had recycling in the room.\\n\\nWe often stay at low budget hotels, and this place was less clean than most.  Attached are some photos of just a sample of the stains and food that were smeared on the wall when we checked in.  There was a weird stinginess about the place.  For example, the room came with a dishwasher and we stayed 5 nights, but they only provided us with 2 dishwashing detergent tabs.  There was also a coffeemaker, but for two of us they provides a total of 4 coffee pods.  The room was serviced once during our 5 days, which was okay if they had let us know but it was strange they didn't tell us and we started to get overflowing trash.  There are some cooking implements but no hand dish soap, salt, etc.  We bought a bunch of breakfast food when we arrived because their website said breakfast was discontinued due to Covid, but when we left the first morning we saw that they were serving breakfast.  They have one instant coffee machine that folks were lining up for, with pastries, apples and yogurt.  The balcony looked inviting but was locked for unexplained reasons",
            "At first we thought this place was a bit out of the way and we should have stayed at the waterfront.  Well actually Church Street was the right choice, located on Church between Wellesley and Bloor\\u002F Yonge on the subway it was actually a really good location.\\n\\nWent for the bigger apartment (which we probably didn\\u2019t need) and appreciated the space.  Though a little tired the place was clean and well run.  Really comfy bed.  Perhaps a better range of TV channels for non Canadian visitors.  I wouldn\\u2019t have minded if they were in English or French, just a bit more choice.\\n\\nBreakfast is why I have marked the star rating down.  Breakfast is served in a small room that would seat probably a dozen people.  The food doesn\\u2019t vary and if staying for more than two days you are likely to tire of it.  Let\\u2019s just say it\\u2019s an interpretation of a continental breakfast.  But that\\u2019s not why you are in Toronto. Right?  There are plenty of places nearby to get breakfast, but that\\u2019s a pain to feel that you need to, having the cost already in your price.  It\\u2019s probably a better idea to grab breakfast, head to the lift and have it in your room, especially at busy times",
            "I booked the Junior Suite with kitchenette, and a washer & dryer. These were extremely useful! It had a full-sized refrigerator and stove, and a dishwasher.  The suite was very, very clean and comfortable. I was on a high floor, with a great eastern view (note that there is construction on the west side.) Front desk staff are very professional and attentive. They recommended the purchase of a monthly parking pass to save me money. I also recommend using transit downtown. The Bloor\\u002FYonge subway interchange is less than a five minute walk away, and the subway is accessible (elevators and escalators - at least in the city core). The neighbourhood is people-friendly, and well served by caf\\u00E9s, restaurants, shopping, and small grocery markets nearby. Internet service was very good. I don\\u2019t have cable tv at home, and enjoyed watching that. NOTE: As with many suite hotels, housekeeping will visit only once per week; I didn\\u2019t need anything, but the front desk would have obtained extra towels, etc. I would have stayed longer if I could have, and the Town Inn will be my base the next time I am in Toronto. Book early so you get a high floor and a better view!  NOTE ALSO: if you park at the hotel, there are stairs from the parking garage to the elevators. I managed fine, but persons with more severe mobility issues will need to be dropped off at the front entrance or use the \\u201CGreen P Parking\\u201D on Charles Street.\\nThis hotel is an exceptional value for the city centre. Thank you, Town Inn!",
            "I recently stayed at the Town Inn Suites and was pleasantly surprised. It is centrally located to downtown and the subway. It is very walkable. There are rental bikes nearby if you was to bike around the city. The suites are large with a separate bedroom and kitchen. The rooms are clean. The continental breakfast is basic. I will stay here again if my travels bring me back to Toronto",
            "The room are fully equipped with Kitchen amenities, they are spacious and comfortable. This hotel is centrally located and easy access to subway and food outlets. Also it is safe location for families who intend to visit Toronto.  Their front office Manager Mr. Vishal was very helpful as he was always available to address our concerns",
            "This is well located hotel with full kitchen and dining table rooms with street views still .\\nSubway station within 10 minutes walk and convenience stores around .\\nEveryday cleaning staff ensured towels and toiletries were replaced daily  and wifi worked pretty well .\\nAman at front office and the manager Vishal need to be complimented for ironing out  our first time stay .Will be back when next time travelling there .\\nOnly some rooms need to be refurbished   and hope would by the time we come back next",
            "Great hotel for a family with plenty of space to keep everyone happy.  Fully equipped kitchen which we used mainly for the fridge, has dishes and cutlery, as well as a corkscrew.\\n\\nHousekeeping daily for new towels, emptied trash, and made beds.\\n\\nBreakfast is limited, but you can bring back to the room",
            "We booked a suite here for a 4 day stay in Toronto. The suite was fairly spacious, but in our suite there was not so much as even a small refrigerator or a coffee maker. There was a balcony that was locked, so no way to access it.  The bathroom would have been good, but there was only one towel rack in the whole place. The rooms seemed cold and needed something to warm them up, such as throw pillows.   Breakfast was short and sparse. It ended at 9 AM. I got there at 8:50 to an empty coffee pot. I asked the attendant to bring more coffee. She smiled and said, That's It for coffee for the day. Unbelievable! What kind of hospitality it that? The breakfast room was tiny, not even close to big enough for a hotel this size. In short, I found this hotel to have lots of potential, but very little of it was realized. They need to up their game",
            "Nice clean well equit rooms.  In ideal location for exploring Toronto near to a subway station. Staff friendly and helpful.\\nThe only issue was with breakfast as the room was tiny so had to take food back to the apartment to eat. Also only opened till 9am for breakfast felt this should have been longe",
            "Great location in Toronto. We stayed in a two bedroom suite with kitchen. The kitchen diner was great with loads of space and air conditioning however the rest of the apartment was tired @nd needed updating. No access to the balcony and a tiny windowless bathroom. No air conditioning anywhere except in the kitchen diner. Continental breakfast was limited in variety. Lots of space and facilities for a group of five however I would not stay here again unless all areas were update",
            "My family and I, including 2 cats,  had to find an affordable place to stay while we were putting our condo on the market to sell. The location had to have a full kitchen and enough space for us all and more importantly would allow flexibility on the duration and of course accept pets.  Town Inn Suites was just the spot in the city. Super friendly, kind and professional staff, amazing location, clean and very diligent when it came to bring us items we needed",
            "I was looking for a place that had a kitchen, and so this hotel provided a great full kitchen. But the suite was extremely bland, with laminate floors, plain walls, and Ikea-style furnishings. No personality at all. The room was large but I would have gladly given up half the space for an ounce of elegance and aesthetic appeal. The old-fashioned heating unit never got the room temperature above 19 degrees and so I had to get a space heater in order to bring the room to a comfortable temperature. Despite the website saying that the hotel had been renovated, the bathroom was the style of a Motel 6. The bathtub was strongly stained, giving it a very shabby appearance. There was no hook to hang bath towels. On the plus side, the parkade was very convenient, running $30\\u002Fnight. The staff was extremely friendly, with a very pleasant check-in. One drawback that is not due to the hotel itself is that it is directly across the street from a large construction site. Construction began at 6 am, hence not allowing for a full night\\u2019s sleep",
            "Stayed here for 5 days. The staff are extremely  helpful and efficient and have a professional  style. We were upgraded to a lovely apartment before we left Australia  perhaps  because  we mentioned  that we were on our honeymoon!! Jun couldn't  do enough for us with emails back and forth, prior to us beginning  our trip across  Canada. The Deluxe King Suite was lovely..even has a kettle!!! Kitchen is very modern with good appliances  and full size oven and stove top. Large microwave oven, and very large stainless steel  fridge. The only minus was the free breakfast.  Very basis choices indeed..\\nThere is a decent grocery store at the corner of the next block, which is a few minutes  walk ( a convenience  store is directly across from the hotel) (didn't go to that one). A hairdressing  salon is just around the corner and Croissant  Tree restaurant  is diagonally  opposite.  This eatery is great for any time of the day meals or snacks. Very cheap quality food in a nice setting.. There is a coin laundry in the hotel and an indoor pool. Dog friendly  too. Definitely  would recommend this  hotel",
            "Recently stayed here with some friends.  Stayed in 2 bedroom suite. Upon arriving entered hotel lobby which was decorated beautifully recently renovated. Staff was very informative and detailed. On what hotel offered. Hotel offers complimentary breakfast from 7am again lounge is nicely decorated and updated. Has a pool and sauna for your personal use.   Hotel is in an amazing location close to all attractions and walking location to shops. Hotel staff was very helpful Assisting with our needs. Room was modern and nicely decorated. Only thing about this hotel is there is a $1000 deposit required for stay even though we  only spending one night. However due to the hotel amenities inside the room fridge stove microwave and newly update could understand why. When booking wanting great location and feeling the comforts of home away from home this is a great place to stay",
            "Always clean. Employees always ready to accomodate clients.\\nRooms clean. With the kitchenette, really practical. We recommand.\\nWe book sometimes last minute and they have rooms. With or without kitchenette",
            "It's not the nicest hotel in Toronto but it checks off all the boxes in terms of everything you'd need from a hotel. Rooms are big with a kitchen, although I didn't use it. There was also a free breakfast, which didn't have a ton of options, but helps with a quick start to the day. The staff are great and I'd probably come back",
            "One of the best hotels I've stayed at. The Aircondition worked, so many kitchen appliances, the room was spacious, the bed was big and locations was okay with nearby A&W and other restaurants. We didn't bother with the breakfast anymore hehe",
            "This suite hotel must have been nice when it was an apartment. It hasn't been kept up. the balcony doors are locked. I asked if mine could be opened, and was told that they have been locked for years, and could not be opened. The kitchen is fine to keep things in the fridge and heat things up in the microwave, but I wouldn't be excited to cook in it. It does come with an included  breakfast of coffee\\u002Ftea muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit"

Wonderful to walk downstairs to George for dinner, to the spa for a massage, or up the street to the subway to get around the city.  Staff is first rate, attentive, and respectful of my privacy. It's expensive but the price is fair",

It is truly a hidden gem within downtown Toronto. You are in heaven in downtown Toronto! Peaceful, stunning rooms, incredible service, fantastic atmosphere, luxury and pampering at its best.\\n\\nWhat made me incredibly sad though was that they don't allow dogs; that's about the worst thing I can say :(\\n\\nIf you are lucky enough to be able to get in you would be crazy to pass up on the opportunity!\\n\\nL",
            "Definitely not your usual hotel. Looking for a home away your home.....This is the place where to go when you are in Toronto. Even if not located in some fancy neighborhoods, this place is a gem. At first a \\\"Women's club\\\" , the Ivy offers some rooms now... Mine was .. Yes ... awesome. A large room with a large bed, a pretty big bathroom with for the first time ever of my life a bath salt \\\"bar\\\" ... Breakfast it serve at your door at the requested time. Might be a little bit light (missing some toasts and butter), ordered croissants and chocolate brioche and ends-up with a muffin with grapes   ... But this was good.\\nTeam is great ... I will highly recommend this place ... Especially if you are a woman ... Next time i will try the SPA",
            "The Ivy at Verity was a very unique experience in the best way. It's set in part of a private club and therefore you miss out on the busy lobby and usual hotel dealings. Instead you'll find a very well appointed room with awesome amenities like AppleTV for Netflix, an amazing Hastens bed and very polite seamless service. Each morning a lovely breakfast was left outside our door, the honor bar was great and we really enjoyed being able to nip in off the street, walk directly to our room without seeing a soul. It's an extremely high quality stay in a city with hotels all over the map. \\n\\nGeorge Restaurant was lovely, great cocktails, nice service. \\n\\nMy only thought is to be aware that the neighborhood can be a bit goofy at night. Just make sure you head west, where the action is. It was a great location to catch a game at the Air Canada Centre however! \\n\\nDefinitely recommend! Thanks Ivy",
            "The Ivy is a wonderful boutique hotel in downtown Toronto.  Everything in the room is top notch from the overall spaciousness of the room, the decor, the walk-in shower room, the deep soaking tub, upscale ammenities etc.  The staff were attentive and accommodating and helped make our stay a great one.  We would recommend this hotel highly to anyone",
            "Great hotel, unique experience. Highly recommended. George Restaurant was also amazing. Friendly staff, good breakfast and complimentary drinks all day. We also liked the spa, which is for women only. A bit weird neighborhood, but quite close to everything",
            "We just left Toronto and loved our stay at the Ivy at Verity. The hotel is at a women's club and there are only four rooms, so taxi drivers tour buses, etc may not be familiar with it. Just made us more thankful we found this hidden gem. We actually stayed in two different rooms for our two night stay (2 and 4). Both were very specious, with large balconies, tasteful decor, and lots of natural light. The beds were super comfortable and it was very cozy and upscale at the same time. The bathrooms were huge. The staff was very responsive and helpful, particularly George. They provided a simple breakfast and were very eager to help with any questions we had. A great place for a couples getaway. We also enjoyed appetizers in the club's lounge and were very impressed with the quality of the food",
            "The Ivy is a hidden gem in the centre of Toronto.  Spacious beautifully decorated rooms, luxurious linens and the bathrooms are stocked with the best toiletries - a deep bath and separate shower stall.  You  feel pampered and regenerated.  Great dinner package options at George restaurant and spa options at the spa. Small and personal - treat yourself",
            "I absolutely love the Ivy Hotel and have stayed there several times.  It is a perfect retreat for a romantic get away with your partner and there are several packages available which include dinner at the hotel's George Restaurant.   I have also used the Ivy when having a girls' day with my sister, niece and mom at the adjacent Sweetgrass Spa and an evening out so the room was nice to come back to.   In addition, I have used the Ivy for business purposes if I book a corporate dinner at George or have meetings downtown the next day, the Ivy is conveniently situated in the downtown core.   The 4 room boutique hotel is luxurious and cozy with a unique ambience.  The staff and service is attentive. I am already looking forward to my next stay",
            "We absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was so welcoming and helpful. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was perfect. \\nThis hotel is owned by the women's club and was originally used exclusively by the club for when they had guests in town. Now anyone can book a room if you are lucky enough to nab one. There are only four rooms in the entire hotel and they are separated away from the rest of the club so it is very quiet. The rooms are very large with a king bed and beautiful full wall windows with a door onto a private balcony. Each room is color coded and unique. the bathroom comes with heated floors, a separate room for the toilet, an amazing shower, and the largest bath tub I have ever seen. I am 6'2\\\" and I could stretch out in the tub with room to spare. The added bonus is the in house made bath salt that they provide in three different scents.\\nYou also get breakfast delivered to your door. It is not a large meal but it gets you through to lunch. \\nThe last thing I have to say is that you MUST have dinner at George while you are there. This restaurant specializes in tasting menus for all dietary plans. The biggest benefit is that after your three hour multi -course meal you just have to walk up the hidden staircase to your room (never leaving the building). \\nI will definitely stay here again if ever back in Toronto",
            "To start off, the reception greeted me with smiles and hospitality.  The room was extremely clean and set up with bath salts and nice music.  The bed was like drifting on a soft cloud.  The decor and art were stunning and well thought out.  I felt at home and much relaxed in this hotel and didn't want to leave.  Especially after an amazing massage done right in the convenience of my room.  The staff was extremely accommodating and allowed me a late check out, so I could soak in the tub with some lavender bath salts (tub big enough for two).  mmmm...\\n\\nI would return to this hotel at any opportunity I may have",
            "Amazing getaway in the heart of Toronto.  Great location, only four rooms in the entire hotel, gorgeous boardrooms, library, balconies.  The hotel rooms are enormous, luxurious, romantic and spotless.  The spa downstairs is just for women (which was kind of wonderful) but the male half of a couple might feel a little left out.  Then he should remind himself that he gets paid more than his wife does to do the same job\\u2026 and go relax in the giant bathtub instead",
            "Had a girl trip July 7th thru July11th and had picked The Ivy at Verity.  So glad we did!  It was wonderful.  Couldn't hardly get out of bed in the morning because the bed was like sleeping on a cloud!  The breakfast was amazing.  Fresh croissants and banana bread, fruit and yogurt. The pool area was beautiful and relaxing.  The highlight was George, our concierge, who was too wonderful for words!  He was so helpful with helping plan our day and making suggestions for us.  He found out we loved iced tea, so always had it ready for us at any time of the day.  He booked our day trip to Niagra Falls, which was wonderful.  We didn't want to leave!  I would never want to stay anyplace else in Toronto.  Loved it, loved it!  Miss you now, George!!  You made our trip the best",
            "The Ivy isn\\u00B4t so much a classical hotel. It\\u00B4s a business club with serveral nice meeting lounges, a lady fitness studio, a spa and perhaps the best restaurant \\\"George\\\" I have ever eaten at. We were told - also there was no one, when we we stayed - that the Ivy is a hot spot for weddings in Toronto. And I can understand this.\\n\\nThe rooms - they only have four, so feel yourself luck if you get one - are big and lovely decorated, with over king size beds which might be the most comfortable I ever had sleeped in, a big bath - seperated shower and closet - with Bulgari toiletries and several different bathing salts available for disposal in the big bathing tube.\\n\\nThe breakfast - croissant, cake, fresh fruit and juice, coffee or tea, everything excellent - was offered on tray outside the room on an old french pastries table and had to be carried in your room. We ate it on our balcony with view to the patio. Great start of the day. Coffee (Nespresso) and softdrinks were complimentary the whole day. \\n\\nThe hotel itself is very central, probably 10 min walk to Eaton Center with a subway station just around the corner and big public parking space on the other side of the street.\\n \\nSo go there, even if you don\\u00B4t want to mary",
            "Stay here ONLY if you want to feel pampered, rich and completely relaxed. Stay here ONLY if you like complimentary breakfast delivered to your room with fresh-squeezed orange juice and homemade chocolate scones. \\nStay here ONLY if you like the idea of being in the middle of a big city but waking on to your balcony to overlook a garden area that\\u2019s as peaceful as the countryside. \\n\\nThe pictures don\\u2019t lie. It\\u2019s every bit (and better) what the hotels pictures show. My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed every second. \\n\\n10\\u002F10 the best hotel we\\u2019ve every stayed in. Thank you The IVY at Verity for giving these two perpetually tired parents their first night away!",
            "What a gem of a hotel.  Beautiful decor, impeccably maintained, and can't say enough about the most comfortable bed we've ever experienced.  The bathroom has heated floors, and the scent of homemade bathsalts (lavender, jasmine and eucalyptus) permeated through to the bedroom.  Would definitely stay there again",
            "This centrally located downtown Toronto hotel is extremely spacious, beautifully appointed and impeccably conceived. I'd like to move in. (The continental breakfast delivered to your door, the heated flooring in the very large bathroom, the generous balcony overlooking the intimate brick courtyard, the gorgeous drapes and furniture...) And yes, of course, all the technology required for a 21st century traveler",
            "Strange setting, 4 room hotel inside a women's only networking club in central Toronto.\\nSet in a beautifully renovated industrial complex, the room was a treat to the senses, salts for the bath, special wood floors in the bathroom. Everything about the room was perfect. We also had a beautiful little terrace overlooking a courtyard where we had breakfast.\\nThe affiliated George restaurant was also magnificent, and all the staff was attentive and knowledgable.\\nI loved the place.\\nI'll definitely go back",
            "We chose the Ivy's Urban Retreat package for one night as a way to celebrate our anniversary in Toronto. In the city, there are no shortage of luxury hotel options, but it can be difficult to find a place to stay that is really in the \\\"boutique\\\" category while offering privacy, luxury, fun, and peace while away from home. In just about every category for evaluation, the Ivy excels. This 4-room hotel downtown stands out and above other options in Toronto, and we're thrilled to have discovered it.\\n\\nYou can request a particular room when booking, and we chose room #2. With a calming colour scheme, plenty of space, a gorgeous marble bathroom (deep tub and huge shower room!), and a large flat screen with a blu-ray player, it's well-outfitted, comfortable, and very quiet. You have access to a refreshments area with honour bar and complimentary soft drinks, as well as access to the members only lounge area, which we didn't make use of. Their packages have incredible value, and we had the chance to enjoy an included five-course meal at the onsite George restaurant and an hour long massage at the onsite Sweetgrass spa. \\n\\nTo clarify some confusion amongst the reviews and elsewhere, Verity is the parent company here and responsible for the spa and restaurant, as well as the hotel. The spa (and this includes all available fitness facilities) is women only, but this absolutely does not mean that men are somehow unwelcome. In fact, should you wish, men can request in-room spa services. As a male guest, I absolutely loved my stay here, and my partner was able to make use of the beautiful spa facilities. \\n\\nToronto seems to be a city where it can be difficult to feel as if value matches cost for accommodations. The Ivy at Verity bucks this unfortunate trend and offers an experience we hope to someday return for",
            "We stayed here after our wedding before going home to Etobicoke, and I am so happy that we did! We arrived late (about 1am?) and the concierge was there to greet us and take a breakfast order. The room was well-appointed - beautiful furniture, gorgeous lighting, a patio overlooking the courtyard.  The bed was easily the most comfortable I've ever slept on in my life. And the bathroom! HUGE tub, heavenly salts, separate toilet and shower stalls... just to die for. Breakfast was juice, coffee\\u002Ftea, pastries, yogurt & fruit -- and was waiting on a tray for us in the lobby area which also had a nice bar to choose from (though we weren't in the mood to take advantage of it seeing as it was 9am). I would recommend this place to everyone",
            "Got a chance to stay at Ivy in colourful Room 3 (each of the 4 rooms is different in size or decor) on a Saturday night.  Pure bliss!  Huge bathroom with separate room for the toilet and separate large shower stall and huge soaker tub with choice of scented bath salts.  High-end Hastens bed, swivel wall-mounted flat screen large TV, desk, 2 upholstered chairs, overstuffed armchair, ottoman, actual balcony facing peaceful courtyard (over George restaurant), and complimentary continental breakfast (coffee ready to order) and honour bar (several full-size bottles but no gin; two kinds of wine and assorted beers kept on ice) available just outside the room for in-room enjoyment.  \\n\\nBeing a Saturday\\u002FSunday, the business centre\\u002Flibrary area of the private women's club upstairs was empty and the concierge said I could use it.  Although the gorgeous basement-level pool, hot tub, and spa area is women-only, I still recommend this place to couples if the man can skip that part.  We got the urban one-night getaway package, so a 4 course tasting menu at George was included.  The service at George was a little rough -- we weren't offered any upgrades or wine pairings and the amuse bouche and first two courses came out too quickly --  we hadn't even received our aperitif cocktails yet!\\n\\nIvy is significantly cheaper than staying at Hazelton but now that I've stayed overnight at both, I would choose Ivy again and again.  The only difference is the slightly smaller closet space at Ivy compared to the two-sided closet\\u002Fstorage area in Hazelton rooms, and the lack of a TV in the bathroom at Ivy.  Otherwise the room setup and comfort quality is the same.  Ivy provides Bulgari white tea scented toiletries along with the choice of 3 scented bath salts.  Hazelton provides a fridge in-room stocked only with wine products and teas whereas Ivy gives many choices just outside the room and a free breakfast (Ivy continental included 2 kinds of croissants, jam, apple strudel slices, an interesting coconut oatmeal porridge that tasted great at room temperature, fresh berry fruit salad, choice of orange or grapefruit juice, and hot tea or coffee on demand.)  Yes, Hazelton does room service and has a restaurant open for brunch on site, whereas George at Ivy does not provide that flexibility.  The indoor pool at Hazelton was a huge disappointment (no windows, awful lighting and no relaxation area around the pool) whereas the women-only pool at Ivy is lovely and even has an underwater treadmill!  Queen Street East between Church and Jarvis is no Yorkville.  But for $200+ less on average per night, Ivy offers better value at a similar standard",
            "I stayed at the Ivy in November and it was wonderful! The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated and so serene. I especially love the bathroom, and the special touch of the bath salts \\\"buffet\\\". After a night out at the nearby distillery district, we enjoyed decadent desserts from George in the comfort of our room. The service was great. This was my 3rd time at Ivy and I expect I will return again",
            "It's official--The Ivy at Verity is now my new favourite hotel in all of Toronto. From the moment I was greeted at the front door to the morning I left I felt incredibly welcomed and spoiled. The rooms are beautifully decorated and luxurious, I appreciated the self serve open bar set-up outside my door and can't even describe how amazing my meal at the George restaurant was. Incredible experience. I would (and will) highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Toronto from now on. Amazing accommodations",
            "This hotel is part of a small, elegant upscale spa and restaurant complex and women's club. The restaurant is superior as are the spa facilities and the rooms.  Decoration is in impeccable taste in every part of the complex.  The beds are British--Hypnos is the brand.  They are ultra-luxury in price; more importantly, they make for an exceptional sleep. We had a perfect escape to an elegant oasis in the middle of Toronto in the winter.  Highly recommended",
            "Not only our favorite place in Toronto, the Ivy at Verity is one of the nicest and most perfects hotels we have ever stayed at.  My mom and I, who take a trip every year, enjoyed the spacious and intricately decorated Room # 3.  Everything was spotless, comfortable, and beautiful.  Every detail of this \\\"hotel\\\" (more like an oasis) was designed and thought through.  I oftentimes found myself wanting to return to the Ivy and other areas of Verity (Sweetgrass Spa, Member's lounge, Library, Computer area) to lounge in the chairs, hang out on the room's large private patio, have a drink at the private honor bar, or take a dip in the pool or bath (prepared with salts and tea preparations).  The concierge was available 24hrs and extremely kind and helpful in accommodating any of our needs or desires, altering our daily delivered breakfasts, making reservations and offering suggestions catered to our likes, and personally introducing us to the host at George Restaurant before our reservation.  We cannot say enough good things about the Ivy\\u002FVerity\\u002FSweetgrass Spa, where you can find every amenity at high quality, spectacular service, and a beautiful ambience.  It is private but alive, and suited for a getaway, for business, and for romance.  With an entrance through Verity, as well as a private entrance (with secure coded door) for the rooms, a guest can customize his\\u002Fher stay.  The location was central to many places such as a few blocks from the subway, or a walk to St. Lawrence Market\\u002FDundas.  We cannot wait to return and could have enjoyed many more days at the Ivy at Verity!  Thank you for a wonderful experience",
            "I've been staying in Marriotts, Hiltons and Holiday Inns for over 4 years with work, but it's only by coming to The Ivy that I'm reminded how good a hotel experience you can have if you go to the boutique places.\\nThe first thing is even though this is effectively 'an old boys club for women', my wife booked it for our first trip to Toronto and we both found it to be utterly beautiful, relaxing and a joy to stay in. We could happily move into room 3 and never leave, the bed and bathroom are brilliant, the honesty bar and espresso machine outside the room make you feel at home to come and go as you please, the staff were super friendly and helpful, and even though the spa is women only they allowed us in after hours. As for the George restaurant, we've never had a better tasting menu anywhere in the world. A rare foodie experience I'll not forget in a hurry.\\nOne of those places that genuinely nourishes your body and mind. Can't say enough good things about it",
            "You owe it to yourself ( and to your spouse) to go on quick getaways and this Spa is ideal for that purpose. With Only 4 rooms it does require a bit of planning but once you have been whisked to iour private paradise, the biggest problem will be to get your better half to leave the room ! Starting with a show piece Hastens bed,  Italian linens  your ill undoubtebly have the best sleep of your life! A Wall of windows and french doors open up to  a gorgeous  indoor courtyard. ( I guess a summer visit is required), .\\nWe have now been spoiled for any other hotel room ever again!\\nWe will be back hereoften, often,  often and we look forward to trying George, the restaurant on the main floor.",
            "My husband had an in- room massage, I relaxed in the spa, before our wonderful dinner at George. Back in our luxurious room, later that evening, we enjoyed a brandy and watched a light snow falling on our terrace.  A magical birthday getaway. Can't wait to go back",
            "We always like to stay in what we call small luxury hotels or special places. The Ivy is both. In the hart of a former chocolate factory you find a hotel space that is very special. Great design, fine materials, very quiet airco, fine linen, great shower, lots of space for your clothes and bags. And breakfast is served in your room! At 08.00 it is outside your door, get it in and enjoy all you ordered the evening before. Very nice and helpful staff",
            "Who knew that I could travel a half hour from home and feel like I was in Paris?! We had a lovely stay at the Ivy for a 1-night getaway in the city. \\n\\nI can't compliment the hotel and it's staff enough. First and foremost was the European-inspired decor of this chic little boutique hotel - just stunning. With only 4 rooms, it's intimate and cozy, but doesn't feel 'small'.  \\n\\nWonderful spa, library and lounge area. The hotel rooms are excellent -  no detail spared. The walkout to the terrace was a nice surprise. \\n\\nThe 'honesty bar' in the sitting room down the hall was a personalized touch. \\n\\nWill definitely be back",
            "My husband and I stay in Toronto every few months so like to try different hotels each time. Recent stays have included Intercontinental Yorkville, Pantages, and Ritz-Carlton. For our latest stay, we booked a room at The Ivy at Verity. I can honestly say I've never had a more lovely hotel stay! The staff seemed very proud to work there and were both warm and professional.\\nThe room we stayed in (Room 1) was large and beautifully appointed ... The care they've put into decorating each room is apparent in every fabric and furniture choice. The bed was luxuriously comfortable and the bathroom spoiled us with heated floors, marble vanity and a selection of aromatherapy bath salts. \\nThe common area immediately outside the rooms is a charming space with a large granite table used for drinks in the afternoon and breakfast in the morning. Alcohol was $6 a drink (very reasonable) and done on the honour system...all the drinks were out on the table and you filled out a card with what you drank to bring to the concierge later for payment. Espresso and soda was free as was the wifi and a continental breakfast. That breakfast was also delicious! Large flaky, buttery croissants, yoghurt and granola, hard boiled eggs, and juice were waiting on trays labelled with each room number and you simply rang the concierge to have fresh coffee delivered when you woke up.  \\nI didn't want to leave! I can't wait to try this hotel in the summer and enjoy the lovely terrace.\\nWell done, Ivy... You've created a little oasis in the heart of the city",
            "Our room was large and beautifully appointed with eclectic modern decor. \\nThe bathroom was massive, with a separate shower and tub (with complimentary menu of bath salts) and had a spa-like feel. \\nThe concierge was extremely helpful and courteous.\\nComplimentary breakfast is brought to the room (with pastries baked by the chef from the exquisite restaurant downstairs). \\nThe beautiful balcony overlooking the restaurant courtyard is a perfect spot to take breakfast. \\nThe room was very quiet, albeit a bit bright in the morning - I'd recommend blackout curtains. \\nAside from George (downstairs), Origin is another restaurant nearby that is worth a visit",
            "This boutique hotel is exactly that. Small, but beautifully put together. Staff were all fantastic. Rooms perfect. Best bathrooms we've found in Canada, and when the weather allows a lovely veranda to sit on. Attached is a ladies health club and spa, and if I lived in Toronto I would join. Can you start one in England  - preferably near where I live \\uD83D\\uDE04 Husband and I had a champagne breakfast to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was lovely",
            "This is a hotel within a women-only club, so only females have access to the pool, spa and gym.  The rooms are great, and service is excellent, so I didn't mind staying in the room or walking in the neighborhood while my wife enjoyed the facilitie",
            "We stayed at the Ivy for one night -- our honeymoon -- and it was fantastic. It is truly an oasis in the heart of downtown Toronto and you will be pampered! The beds are so plush, you will not want to get out of bed. We especially enjoyed the very spacious and stylish bathrooms, especially the very large and lovely soaking tub and showers. Can't wait to go back",
            "The rooms at the Ivy are so beautiful, you really don't want to leave them.  Save time to enjoy the spa like bath, with an assortment of scented salts and heated floors - enjoy a drink or breakfast on the balcony overlooking the secluded patio of the George restaurant - and make sure you get your full eight hours sleep in the heavenly beds - amazing comfort and luxury.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, each one with a different interior design, and unlike anything you would get at a large chain hotel.  Within walking distance of downtown Toronto, the Ivy is conveniently located albeit off the beaten path.  We liked being able to enjoy a bottle of champagne in the seating area outside the rooms as a group - almost like being in your own home - before heading downstairs to the wonderful George restaurant. Personal and knowledgable concierge staff - access to Internet and computers - on site spa - and ambience from the exclusive Verity Women's Club.  I have stayed at the Ivy many times, and already am looking forward to my next visit",
            "The Ivy at Verity ( a private women's club in downtown Toronto) attached to 5 star dining at George Restaurant with it's own private courtyard patio.\\nPosh but cozy, exclusive but welcoming. So beautiful and stylish but with plenty of substance. The people are warm and helpful and the beds are Hastens so the best sleep ever acheived. There is a Verity spa (complete with hot tub, steam room, and sauna ) on property called Sweetgrass that is exclusive for women but men staying in the hotel can have treatments in their hotel room. They even have fitness facilities (again, exclusive to women)  and you can add on a yoga class if you want for a nominal fee.\\nFabulous stay, incredible bed, God is here, in the deails",
            "The Ivy is a small unique hotel -  four rooms in total - all different and beautifully appointed.  The beds are the most comfortable ever, with the finest of linens.  Decor is simply gorgeous,  beautiful ly upholstered seating, exposed brick walls and lovely wallpapers, bamboo hardwood floors and bamboo tiles in the luxurious bathrooms. Each room has a balcony overlooking an inner city courtyard.  The Ivy is part of Verity Womens Club and upstairs from George Restaurant.  The club's spa and fitness facilities are open to guests .  You feel like a pampered personal friend  rather than a hotel guest..  A small guest lounge with a marble table with selection of fine spirits and wine is part of the lovely surroundings.  Definitely for discerning independent travellers who like to discover unique and special properties",
            "A Gem in a perfect location. Where do I begin. I was greeted by a super nice and friendly staff. I was early for an appointment but interested in my wedding possibly there. I met with planner immediately who was a sweetheart. Just for any thinking about a wedding there, the prices can't be beat!  When I returned I was taken up to my room. The hotel is so lush, with velvet, satin,art work, a library and lounge. One of my favourite features is the honour bar which has inexpensive drinks, free pop, and a espresso coffee machine and tea. The best part was it was right out my bedroom door. The continental breakfast was just the right amount and delicious. The room was just WOW!  It was huge and the wonderful scent from the bath crystals was light yet a delight to the senses. The fixtures were unusual and very artsy. The bathroom was huge! Everything was soft and plush from towels, bedding and bath robes. I only had the pleasure of one night so not enough time to explore all the hotel and neighborhood had to offer. The menu was on a tablet, unlike some hotels where they are a bit used and messy. If you needed something, a friendly staff member was there quickly. I really can't say enough about this wonderful hotel and staff!  Thank you for an amazing night",
            "The Ivy was the last word in luxury - from a $30,000 mattress (should've come with George Clooney!) to marble tiled bathroom and glorious Bulgari amenities. Sound-proofed room, a sumptuous continental breakfast daily to our door and so very much more - from check-in to departure - made this a stay I've not stopped talking about",
            "This hotel is amazing!  Concierge are very helpful and informative. Room 4 was very large, beautifully decorated with a balcony over looking the courtyard.  Lovely bathroom with bathtub, separate shower and heated floor.  Three types of scented bath salts are available for your bathing pleasure!  An honour bar is available with red and white wine and a selection of spirits.  Continental breakfast, including in house freshly baked croissants is left outside your door at 8am.  \\n\\nDinner is highly recommended at the award winning George Restaurant!\\n\\nI give this hotel 10 out of 10!  Can't wait to go back",
            "I wouldn't have even known this was their unless we were staying there as part of a wedding party, but it was truly a special little oasis in the city.  The room was massive by inner city standards.  There was a king size bed, little sitting are for reading and another one with a little table for eating\\u002Fdrinks.   There was also a large patio with a table overlooking a quiet courtyard.  Never once did it sound like we were in a city.  The bathroom was also huge and had a great assortment of quality soaps including 3 different scents of bath salts.   Room included a continental breakfast.  There also was an open area outside the room with complimentary soft drinks and cocktails for fee.  Would highly recommend this quiet, gem in the city",
            "The Ivy at Verity is a tiny hotel. The set up seems odd at first... it is an exclusive women's club with gym, spa, library, lounges etc, and tucked away on a upper floor, the 4 lovely and spacious guest rooms.  The rooms overlook a court yard and face the windows of an ad agency, where you can see folks working away. At first it felt a bit like we were in a bedroom at work. We kept our drapes closed and all was well. As a woman, all of the amenities were amazing. I think if I had been travelling with a male companion it would have been disappointing.  I was in room three and it was BEAUTIFUL.  Just my style. Very comfortable king bed, incredible bathroom with an irresistible bathtub. All of the soaps and salts and lotions were really lovely and great quality. The room had lots of plush seating, and huge balcony. The honour bar, just outside of the rooms was a really nice touch - although when I was there it was not properly stocked and was never replenished, even after two calls to the concierge. Location is central enough to walk downtown, has a transit stop right out front, and there is paid parking directly across the street. I thought the breakfast was quite good. This will always be my first choice hotel when I stay in Toronto, I really loved it",
            "I am amazed by just how relaxing one night in the city actually was.  \\n\\nBut the bed is lovely.  And the aqua wallpaper in #3 is soothing.  And the design, in general, is excellent.  And the bathroom is exquisite (with great soaps and the like).  And they have this nice internal lobby where there's an honour bar and a Nespresso machine, which is actually where we enjoyed our dessert from George.\\n\\nI would've loved to stay for longer (though, well, it's not exactly a cheap stay), and I would've enjoyed the possibility of a massage.  I kind of wish I could stay here more often.  Shame it's not dog-friendly, and shame that the parking isn't included.  But these are definitely minor",
            "Things I loved about the Ivy:\\nThe pillows\\nGiant bath and nice bath salts\\nThe fancy ginger ale (Fever Tree)\\nThe hairdryer (no awful travel ones here)\\nThe balcony\\nFree Nespresso\\nThe lovely staff\\nThe Bulgari ammenities (I want to smell like this forever)\\nPretty wallpaper\\nFresh flowers everywher",
            "Spent a wonderful weekend in Toronto at The Ivy at Verity.  A boutique hotel with just 4 rooms. Our was beautifully decorated, spacious with an amazing bathroom.   They have thought of everything -- honor bar, round the clock concierge and unique touches like freshly brewed tea to enjoy while you soak in a huge tub soaking in specially chosen bath salts.   It was a truly magical experience.   Can't imagine every staying anywhere else in Toronto.   Book ahead so you won't miss out",
            "I found the Ivy on hotels.com. Thought it sounded unique and it is! Four gorgeously and differently appointed rooms. Huge bathroom with rain shower and deep soaking tub, including in-house-made, complimentary bath salts - a nice touch after a long day of walking. There is an honor bar with white wine, liquors, and soft drinks. Also tea bags and instant coffee. Continental breakfast is included and it is quite ample - yogurt\\u002Fgranola, boiled egg, croissant or muffin, juices, and coffee\\u002Fcream. Really nice.\\n\\nThe only difficulty that I encountered was a previously unannounced electricity outage one night from 10pm to 4am the following morning. WEIRD. A letter left in my room. No explanation. Battery lantern and flashlight provided. \\n\\nThe building is in a sort of run-down block of Queen St just a bit east of the better parts of Queen St West. But I did not feel unsafe. \\n\\nThere is a great women's clothing store a few doors down. Don't miss it! And an excellent antiques store in the the next block east. Plenty of good restaurants a block or two away as well as the upscale George attached.\\n\\nLovely subterranean swimming pool and hot tub. And a spa",
            "We live in Toronto and were celebrating- my birthday, my husbands birthday and my best friend's and her husband's birthday all fall within a month of each other, so we decided this year to celebrate in style- a night at the Ivy. We kicked things off first at the Sweetgrass spa (for women only) then enjoyed a 10 course tasting menu on George's beautiful courtyard patio.\\n \\nGoing with another couple allowed me to gawk at their room too (room #1). I love how this hotel has only four rooms and all are tasteful and elegant, and so different. Our room (#3) was a glamorous blend of modern mixed with classic timeless materials, a nod to their chocolate factory past. Gorgeous blue wallpaper is charming against the relic brick of a bygone era. The rooms themselves are massive, much roomier than any other downtown hotel I've seen. With different seating areas to recline and relax, including a sunny deck that faces George's patio, my husband and I loved every minute of our stay. The bathroom has a super deep soaker tub and inviting aromatic bath salts- they have clearly anticipated your every thought! \\nOne feature I loved was the Samsung tablet that you use to control the television, but also acts as a portable TV, which they have linked to Netflix...cue the Orange is the New Black marathon! \\n\\nMy bestie's room was an intimate portrait of a Parisian hotel, soft pink striped wallpaper was welcoming and warm. Her room was every bit as luxurious as mine, every detail carefully constructed. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back, absolutely adore the staff, spa and restaurant here. It's a rare gem in a city full of over-done, over hyped hotels (IMHO). Nice gestures like the honour bar and delicious complimentary breakfast are just the finishing touches to a spoiled brat weekend. Thanks Ivy",
            "Stayed in room #4 for one night. Concierge was so accommodating- helped with parking and showing us all the ammenities. \\nThe room was spacious and beautiful. Large patio. Complimentary bath salt bar over the spa tub, separate stand up shower and toilet rooms. \\nThe hotel also had a bar for guests in a small sitting area outside the room. It worked based on the honesty system- each drink you had you recorded and were charged 6$\\u002Falcoholic beverage at the end of your stay. They had wine, beer, and all sorts of hard liquor + mix. \\nThere was a complimentary continental breakfast waiting on a table outside your room starting at 715- and when you were ready you called the concierge to bring a pot of fresh coffee. \\nOverall lovely, romantic spot. We also purchased the 4 course tasting menu at George which was amazing. Will return!",
            "We just spent one blissful night at The Ivy at Verity. Could have stayed longer but the hotel was fully booked for the rest of the week. However, even the one night was enough for us to enjoy the wonderful surprises that this hotel offers. This place is a piece of heaven, when you enter the hotel through the Club \\\"Verity\\\" you are transported into another dimension, where your every wish is fulfilled. Our room was tasteful as it was beautiful, colors that soothe, bed linens that feel like \\\"cloud 9\\\", nothing missing or lacking. Best of all, we get to use the facilities of Verity's Sweetgrass Spa, and wine & dine at \\\"George\\\" Verity's 5-star restaurant, all under the same roof. After one night I am refreshed and rejuvenated, as if I spent a week at a resort. A place like this is hard to find, lucky for me I found it. Can't wait to return"

            "Loved staying here. The colour palette was calming, the shower was spacious with great pressure and the bed was so comfortable. I loved the little sitting area with the couch as well. Overall I had a fantastic stay and definitely recommend",
            "The most Beautiful Studio suite, with live plants, the wood decor, and everything thing just perfect. Felt like a magical forest retreat in the middle of the city. The care and ease of checking in and checking out, felt like coming home. \\nThank yo",
            "This was one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed in. The rooms are incredibly comfortable, every design and function decision was made with true sustainability in mind, and the service is 10\\u002F10 (shoutout to Adrian). Highly recommend staying here",
            "This hotel was genuinely so amazing from the second you walked through the doors into the lobby.  Every part of the decor was so thoughtfully placed, and the focus on sustainability and bringing new life to otherwise scrapped materials was so great to see in a hotel.  The service was very efficient and easy to contact, as you could through texting the front desk, and not to mention incredibly kind and thoughtful. The room was so beautiful and felt really homey, and was a great way to spend a couple days away for an anniversary. Oh, and the food was really great. I still think about that avocado toast more often then I'd like to admit. Thank you for such a great experience 1 Hotel, looking forward to my next stay",
            "I attended 1 Hotel for a work meeting, using multiple parts of the hotel, and wow. The service and attention to detail throughout the entire experience was unmatched. We enjoyed excellent cocktails from the lobby bar and a delicious tasting menu with Chef Roland. It is conveniently located in downtown Toronto but everything you need can be found within the hotel. Anyone looking to book a professional, high-caliber event will be in good hands here with Steven, Kencia, and Dan",
            "We came to stay at 1hotel for the weekend before Valentine's day and our experience from start to finish was absolutely comfortable, enchanting and the most wholesome couple of days imaginable. The staff went above and beyond from the entrance all the way to the hotel room. This is without even mentioning the staff at 1kitchen  Adrien, Nelson, Oscar, Julie, and Hanna had us spoiled and welcomed we couldn't help but visit the restaurant 4 times in 2 days. The kitchen staff abosultely blow us away with the food not to mention the desserts. Definitely worth the visit",
            "I stayed at the 1 hotel in March for the night before and after my wedding. \\nMy room was gorgeous, spacious, clean and had a fully equipped kitchen which was really handy.  People say you don't sleep well the night before your wedding, I slept like a baby. The bed was so comfortable and luxurious. \\n\\nService -  The service at 1 hotel has been nothing short of incredible.  When walking into the hotel you are always greeted in a very friendly manner and they make sure you know that if there is anything you need, it is available to you if you just ask. They provided us a phone number to text them if there was anything we needed to our room and we always received prompt responses and they were always helpful.  \\n\\nFood -  THE FOOD.  When planning our wedding we had several meetings at the hotel.  The food at 1kitchen is always fantastic. The burger... wow!!  Again, all the staff are so friendly and want to ensure your experience is great.  The lobby bar makes a fantastic espresso martini for my martini lovers, and has a really great vibe in the evenings.  I couldn't believe how busy it was on a Saturday night!  The rooftop restaurant is not only beautiful, but also has fantastic food and drinks. \\n\\nOverall - great hotel, great rooms, fantastic staff and I cannot wait to go back time and time again.  I have already recommended the hotel and the restaurants in the hotel to so many people",
            "Beautiful upscale boutique hotel with the coolest vibe. Amazing location in the entertainment district. From the time we checked in, Samantha (at front desk) made us feel welcome and at home. She went the extra mile to make sure that our accommodations were perfect and she prepared a list of restaurants that were some of the best we\\u2019ve ever experienced (and we are world traveler foodies). We will surely be back many times to Toronto and can\\u2019t wait to return to the 1 Hotel!! Awesome all around!",
            "1 Hotel is probably one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in! From the furniture to the food, everything has been thought out from start to finish. The customer service team is very attentive, and the plants in the hotel add such a gorgeous, fresh touch. Highly recommend staying here",
            "Lovely hotel in a great location. The bed was very comfortable and the stuff quite friendly. Attached to the hotel are some great restaurants, so traveling far for good food isn\\u2019t necessary. It was nice they included a Bluetooth speaker in the room so we could play some white noise at night. Hallway noise could be a little distracting for some. Valet was very helpful and the lobby a great place to hang out for live music and drinks in the evening",
            "We had a spacious studio suite on the 9th floor. Initial concerns over noise from construction across the street turned out to be unwarranted.  Highlights of our stay: the hotel restaurant was superb!!  A polished hand in the kitchen that was  on par with a fine dining establishment. \\n\\nFriendly staff  both in the hotel and the restaurant and not a whiff of attitude. Location was close to Farm Boy which meant easy access to breakfast and lunch goodies bought in advance and enjoyed later without having to leave the room.  Thor coffee on the next block was a jewel.  The bedding and the beds were fantastic. And the filtered tap water was great. \\n\\nThe only downside was the bar scene along King Street a couple of blacks away, that was noisy and crowded, not conducive to a relaxing evening strol",
            "Gorgeous hotel. Truly unique. Very attentive service. Nathaniel saw me fumbling, grabbed a cart and bag for my loose items, showed me to my room, explained the details and was extremely pleasant. Room is airy and well designe",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at 1 Hotel Toronto. It\\u2019s location to the water, Queen street shopping and the Stackt market was convenient. The hotel lobby and my room offered a breath of fresh air from the noise and the busyness of the city. I was warmly welcomed by several of the staff. After a long period of travel that left me dehydrated and hungry, there was fresh fruit and flavored water to enjoy while I checked in. My room was an oasis of calm. Though I was street side, the noise didn\\u2019t penetrate the space and the interior design of the room made up for the lack of a view. Everything that the hotel offered that I took advantage of was a positive experience. I borrowed a bike and the concierge provided me with a safe and easy path to the bike path that runs along the water. After a long day, I decided to order room service for dinner. There were several excellent vegan, healthy options. The carrot soup was amazing. It was delivered by an extremely friendly staff person and in a timely manner. My room was equipped with a bathtub. The hotel provided bath salts so I decided to end the evening with a bath. It was a very calm environment and perfect way to end a busy day. The bathroom has everything anyone could need. The toiletries they provide are high quality and smell amazing. The hair dryer was also of high quality. It was a Dyson. I usually travel with my own hairdryer when I check luggage because the hotel hair dryers usually fry my hair. I recently stayed at a Ritz Carlton property assuming they would have a really good dryer but they surprisingly had a super cheap one that made my hair frizzy for the whole trip. Since I was only doing a carry-on, I left my hair dryer at home and was so excited to see that the 1 Hotel stocks their rooms with such a nice hair dryer. . Never underestimate the importance of these small details. The other cool feature of this hotel is that they have Tesla house cars that can take you places in the city within a certain radius. Even though I didn\\u2019t take advantage of this, it was nice to know that it was an option.",
            "Took my family to 1 Hotel last week after a recommendation from a work colleague. Can\\u2019t express how incredible the experience was from the moment we arrived. The hotel itself looks beautiful and we decided to dine at 1 Kitchen, which is one of the in house restaurants. Our server was Hailey who took care of our group as if we had been coming there for years. Service was fantastic in every way. Prompt seating and excellent recommendations, we loved everything about the experience. A special thanks to Clem for the cocktail recommendation for my wife and I. We have different tastes when it comes to drinks so he was sure to recommend a cocktail each of us would enjoy and he was right on the money. My favourite of the night was the Avocado Picante! We will definitely be returning and hopefully soon. If you haven\\u2019t been to 1 Hotel yet I would highly recommend getting yourself there as soon as possible",
            "I have stayed in my fair share of hotels and 1 Hotel Toronto is now one of my very favorites. The service, property, and amenities are impeccable. Brooklyn Lambert, the front office supervisor, and Robin Elliott, the chef concierge, both could not have been more helpful and such a pleasure to meet. They went above and beyond to make sure my son and I had a wonderful week at their hotel. The hotel is VERY enviromentally conscious. I have never stayed at a hotel where all of the water is filtered. Being able to fill up a water pitcher and have cold fresh water during our long stay was definitely a nice feature. \\n\\nAnd, the location can't be beat! They are just a couple of blocks off of King West and Queen West streets. Which means you are a short walk from a ton of restaurants and shops. The restaurants in the hotel are also all amazing! We ate at 1 Kitchen the majority of our time in Toronto! The hotel is also walking distance to the CN Tower and Rogers Centre, where the Blue Jays play. We walked to a game and were there in 15 minutes. In addition to the prime location they also have compimentary Teslas to take you places, within a certain distance from the hotel. There is also a grocery store a very short walk away.\\n\\nWe did take advantage of having a very nice gym and pool. If you have kids you need to be aware of the age limit for the pool. Even with the age limit, they were very accommodating for my 15 year old son to go to the pool during the day. There are personal trainers you can book time with, however I didn't have the opportunity to do that. \\n\\nI look forward to staying at any of the 1 Hotels. I certainly wouldn't stay anywhere else in Toronto. And, a huge thank you to Brooklyn and Robin for helping make my 50th birthday stay in Toronto wonderful",
            "Our experience was excellent from start to finish. We thoroughly enjoyed two nights of bliss. We were treated well by all staff from when we arrived until we left. Our room was beautiful, complete with high-end amenities. The beds and linens were so comfortable, and we appreciated the turn-down service in the evenings. We enjoyed room service and brunch from 1 Kitchen. The bar on the main floor had delicious food and drinks. Dinner at Harriet's Restaurant at the top of the hotel served terrific food and beverages with a fantastic view of Toronto. We can wait to visit this hotel again. It is definitely a 10+ !!",
            "I had the good fortune of hosting a bachelorette at 1 Hotel last month and can't say enough good things about our experience! Immediately after we had booked our stay, I was contacted by our host, Brooklyn, who was incredibly personable, enthusiastic, professional and welcoming! Brooklyn went above and beyond to make our stay great, and went the extra mile by way of offering helpful tips on places to go and things to see. The rooms are beautiful, and the beds are so so comfortable. The location is excellent for a night on the town, steps away from some of the best restaurants and bars in the city. I hope to be back soon",
            "Everything was amazing.  This hotel really focuses on the little things.   For example, there was a yoga mat in the room and after the turn down service there was a robe laid out on my bed and a personalized \\u201CGood evening\\u201D note on the nightstand.  The staff are the friendliest I have ever seen.  Add in the incredible ambiance of this quaint little gem and you have a near perfect stay.  I couldn\\u2019t have been more delighted",
            "The hotel promotes itself as a luxury hotel but the service is poor and it\\u2019s amenities are lacking.  If you ask about the hotels amenities, menus or services most staff won\\u2019t know the answer or worse, will simply make up an answer.  When asked if a house car was available and we were told that they didn\\u2019t know when it would be available or if it would be available.   As we walked out the door there were two house cars out front (30 steps from the person who had no idea when they would be available) that were empty and waiting to take guests wherever they needed to go.  \\n\\nThe hotel itself is beautiful and tastefully decorated but staying there is like giving the keys of a Ferrari to a someone learning to drive.   They don\\u2019t appreciate what they have, they have no idea how to use it, and so they can\\u2019t help others to enjoy it.  \\n\\nThe hotel was opened in August 2021 and promotes sustainability.  They even use Teslas as their house cars.   One small problem with this is that if you actually drive a Tesla (or any EV) you can\\u2019t actually charge it at this hotel.   Most luxury (and even standard) hotels have at least a few electric chargers at this point as automakers roll out more electric cars but this \\u201Ceco\\u002Fsustainable\\u201D hotel has exactly zero chargers.  It\\u2019s actually shocking (no pun intended). \\n\\nThe night life in the main lobby and roof was lively and had a \\u201Cclub\\u201D feel but if you want to experience real luxury and the service that comes from staying in a luxury hotel you may want to try the Ritz, Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, or one of the many other fine hotels in Toronto.  We wanted to give this one a try as we liked the whole sustainability concept but the service was a real let down and we won\\u2019t be back",
            "We have stayed in many nice hotels in many cities around the world. We visit Toronto every summer. I can confidently say that 1Hotel Toronto might be our favorite hotel EVER. \\n\\nWe stayed for 3 nights recently and from start to finish the service just wowed us. In fact, even before we arrived I had been in close touch with Robin Elliot, the Chief Concierge, who was the essence of professionalism, kindness and helpfulness when it came to recommendations and requests. He certainly did not disappoint when we finally had the pleasure of meeting him in person, and for the duration of our stay. Robin made our trip so memorable, going the extra mile constantly to always make sure we were taken care of and happy - which we most definitely were. His warm and engaging personality, positive energy and authentic desire to help blew us away. All 4 of us couldn't stop talking about how wonderful this person is! And we are not usually a gushy family!! \\n\\nEveryone from the front desk staff to housekeeping to the folks at the restaurant\\u002Fbar (1 Kitchen is a fabulous place to eat btw - we had 2 excellent meals here) exemplified the 1Hotel brand - super friendly, positive, there to help you and ensure your stay is perfect. \\n\\nAside from the superior service level (which for me makes or breaks the vacation), the room was beautiful, the fixtures pristine, the bathroom just so beautiful. We don't typically love doorless showers when traveling with kids BUT this one was so tastefully done and in keeping with the natural, sustainable, eco-friendly theme of the hotel which we loved and appreciated that we didn't mind at all. The lobby and interior of the building was also just so gorgeous - reflecting the hotel philosophy oh-so stylishly. Gym was fantastic which both myself and my teen son frequented. \\n\\nWe left feeling so radiantly satisfied with our experience and thrilled that we have found, THE ONE, no pun intended! This will definitely be where we stay from now on, whenever we visit Toronto. We already can't wait for our next visit next summer, if not sooner",
            "It was the perfect home away from home during our stay in Toronto. The welcoming and friendly staff made our stay extremely comfortable. The rooms were super comfortable with beautiful decor with everything needed for your stay, and anything additional needed was only a phone call away. Loved the Flora lounge and rooftop pool and the gym was amazing! Thanks to our favourite staff member Zoe for going above and beyond to make sure our stay was great. We will definitely be back, thank you",
            "I organized a company holiday dinner at the 1 Hotel in the Chestnut ballroom and then up for drinks to Harriet's. The hotel is stunning, it's like walking into an oasis in the city, very unique and no detail overlooked. The food for dinner was incredible, the 360 view of the city on the terrace was unbeatable but what made the whole night was how attentive, warm and professional the staff were. Ryan the banquet manager and his whole team where just the most pleasant to work with and everyone at the dinner noticed, commented and were grateful for the enhanced experience.\\nWe will definitely be coming back for future events! \\nWell done 1 Hotel!\\nNadia T\\nWildcard Experienc",

            "What an awesome, beautiful eco-friendly hotel with amazing interior decor. Would definitely stay here again! I want to check out the one in LA and NY. This hotel came recommended by coworkers who have stayed here before",
            "The venue was beautiful. I was a big fan of 1 Hotels. Unfortunately this place fell a bit short. There were a few issues that prevented the stay from being worth the amount spent to stay here. First we had a toilet issue all weekend. The water ran in the toilet all day and night making it hard to sleep. Staff tried multiple times to fix it but ultimately it was unsuccessful. I would have preferred they offer to move me to another room. And secondly, the hotel is rather loud. It seems this place is more for a party rather than luxury. We could hear lots of people on our floor until very late at night being loud. Also, the competition for the elevator at most times in the evening was a bit disappointing. You have to line up with party people trying to go to the rooftop to get in the elevator to go to your room. Besides all of that, the hotel is very stunning as you walk in, very impressive. Unfortunately though, this doesn\\u2019t feel like a 5 star resort. It\\u2019s more like an elevated 4 star hotel. In all fairness, the staff were very attentive and friendly",
            "Was looking so forward to our stay here after the Blue Jay's game. First off, the front desk didn't even know if an F150 pickup truck would fit in the parking garage, I so I parked outside across the road in Paid Parking.  They best part was the Tesla driver that took us to the Rogers Center.  He was warm and welcoming, but I forget his name.  After the game when we checked in and couldn't wait to go to the rooftop pool and bar, only to find out is was closed for a special event.  This should have been relayed at time of booking because I am certain this special event would have been booked for some time!  Aroma inside the building was amazing and that's about it.  Rain shower head was broken and glass balcony railing was filthy.  City Skyline view...ya right.  We looked directly at a condo building across the road, literally 50ft away, so the view was not nice either.  If I ever go back, hopefully 1 Hotel will do a better job",
            "Location is great for exploring Toronto.\\n\\nWe stayed as a family of 4 in two adjacent rooms (king and panoramic king). The rooms are spacious and decorated with a simple luxury, modern and sustainable vibe. Equipped with all you need including nespresso machines, hairdryers and irons!\\n\\nThe hotel even provided Dyson hair straighteners when my wife\\u2019s UK model would not work with the power supply (thank you!).\\n\\nBathrooms are well appointed with luxurious Bamford cosmetics.\\n\\nGood amenities including a gym, rooftop bar and pool.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the excellent 1 Kitchen breakfasts, but were unable to make the most of the very highly rated Casa Madera (which was booked out privately the only night we could make it \\uD83D\\uDE14) or the rooftop bar which closes very early Monday-Wednesday (1030pm). \\n\\nThe lobby bar was a great place for cocktails, with a chilled ambience and live entertainment.\\n\\nThanks to all the team for looking after us",
            "My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our four night stay at 1 Hotel. It is by far one of the finest hotels at which we've stayed over the years. The overall vibe throughout is calming and nature inspired. The large beautifully arranged lobby\\u002Flounge is where small bites can be ordered and live music enjoyed on weekends. We stayed in an upper level suite and loved the comfortable sectional sofa, having a shower and freestanding tub, and a window that opened for fresh air. The staff is committed to making it's guests feel appreciated and will do whatever it can to enhance their stay. Thank you Mira, for going above and beyond.  The concierge, Robin, was exactly who you'd hope for in any city. He is kind, respectful and very helpful. He suggested a local spa retreat and wonderful restaurants including Adrak, an elegant Indian restaurant with excellent food and over-the-top service. We have highly recommended 1 Hotel to our friends and will definitely return next year",
            "What a transformation from the Thompson Hotel to now 1Hotel.\\nI thought Thompson was amazing, but 1Hotel has exceeded all my expectations.\\nFrom the moment you walk into the lobby, you feel like you're in a spa.  It's such a welcoming space and you just want to grab a seat and a drink and relax.\\nThe attention to detail and the commitment to sustainability is evident throughout the property.\\nIt's all the little touches that brings it all together.\\n5 stars all the way - I can't wait to go back",
            "Our connecting flight from Toronto to NYC was canceled and we were stranded for a few days. We arrived exhausted and miserable about our plight, but all that turned around within minutes of walking into this hotel. We\\u2019re checking out two days later and are almost sad to leave. \\n\\nThe staff are welcoming and highly attentive, the hotel room is beautiful and well designed, and the hotel bars and restaurants are terrific (though not cheap). The entire hotel is an aesthetic delight!There is a heavy focus on environmental sustainability, from using only recycled wood throughout the building to providing a lobby fruit stand containing less than perfect but perfectly edible fruit that would otherwise have been discarded at grocery stores. We did not use the gym or pool but we were told the gym includes Peloton bikes. Judging from the rest of the place, I\\u2019m sure both are gorgeous. Our studio room with a king size bed is spacious, very clean and bright, and well appointed with a Nespresso maker, tea, filtered tap water and snack bar. The bathroom is gorgeous and has a rainfall shower head and the shower gel, shampoo and conditioner smell heavenly. Even the hair dryer is much better than average.\\n\\nThe hotel is located in the fashion district, and although there is a lot of construction going on, it offers some nice dining options within walking distance. The hotel\\u2019s restaurants (including rooftop restaurant) are popular with non-guests of the hotel, so that tells you something. Plus, the hotel offers free Tesla rides within a 4 km radius, which gets you to several key areas such as downtown. \\n\\nIn short, we love this place and we hope to have an opportunity to come back. In fact, we already asked if we can come back if our flight tonight is canceled. Again",
            "Incredible stay, not long enough!  The sustainable design, vibe and convenient location just touches the surface of an incredible experience.  Customer care and service was outstanding.  Specifically, Helena\\u2019s personable and friendly demeanor was icing on the cake post delivery of her perfect libations tailored to delicious bar bites.  Fitness facility has it all and more.  Diverse and delicious menu items in on-site restaurants will not disappoint.  Rooms are well designed, very comfortable, and fitting for a leisure and travel accolade at minimum.  Will definitely revisit 1 Hotel Toronto and others in the brand.  Absolutely awesome",
            "No detail is spared when you stay at 1 Hotel. This is my second experience at a 1 Hotel property, and it just keeps getting better. Jonah, Shamar, and Omar at the front desk\\u002Fbell services were an incredible help to us each day. Maxine and Sabrina were wonderful in the Flora Lounge. The danish and breakfast options in Flora Lounge were fantastic. Lunch at 1 Kitchen was extra fresh and the Aperol Spritz bar was so fun. We visited the Rooftop and my goodness, the views are incredible and the ambiance is unmatched. The rooms are impeccable and their commitment to sustainability at every point in your stay is truly remarkable. How do we get more hotels to be like 1 Hotel?",
            "This hotel is more than an ordinary 5 star hotel, and offers things which you can\\u2018t buy for money. Be it the  lovely and beautifully decorated sushi at the pool deck, Neil and Myra at the front desk with great advice, Ina from housekeeping performing a really impressive and immaculate turn down service, or the pool staff always finding a way to accomodate us. \\nOur double Queen room was nice and very quiet, although we desperately missed some more hooks  (the only real improvement potential). Outstanding towel quality, nicely designed towelling robes. \\nThe hotel location is good, the bar extremely nice, the fitness area very well equipped, and the restaurant 1 kitchen ok if you want an easy meal (good food but was nearly empty in the evening\\u002F portions partly very small\\u002F not competitive vs many other restaurants in the area). \\nAll in all: I would always pick this hotel again",
            "Stayed two nights and it was beautiful.  The location is ideal for anyone wanting to experience downtown, the lobby was inviting and groovy.  Room was perfect.  Interior decor was inspired, and the bed soooo comfy.  Absolute brilliant staycation for us.  Would highly recommend and will certainly go back",
            "I recently stayed at this incredible hotel in Toronto and was thoroughly impressed by their strong focus on sustainability. The diversity in their food and beverage offerings is remarkable, catering to all tastes with a global flair. The rooftop vibe is unbeatable, with stunning views of the city that create the perfect atmosphere for a night out. The employees are warm and hospitable, making every guest feel special, and the management's presence in the lobby and restaurants adds a personal touch to the experience.The trendy crowd and the lively atmosphere make this the place to be in Toronto. Plus, considering the prime location, the pricing is very fair compared to other downtown hotels. Without a doubt, this is the best hotel and restaurant in Toronto. I can't wait to come back",
            "I was wondering if this location would live up to the Miami location and it definitely does. I am an avid traveler and a foodie, the 1 Hotel is definitely right up my alley. My girlfriend and I came to Toronto for a weekend getaway and I am SO happy we chose this spot.\\n\\nEvery single staff member, from the front desk, to the bartenders, to the pool service, to the housekeepers, EVERYONE was genuinely happy, attentive and so friendly. Making us feel right at home. \\n\\nThe food at the restaurants is absolutely delicious. Try the Bento Box up at the pool, it was the perfect lunch. Also stopped into the 1 Kitchen for a drink before dinner. The spicy marg was perfectly concocted. \\n\\nWe treated ourselves to a suite with a bathtub and it was SOOO relaxing. The perfect way to unwind after a long day. The gym was also very impressive. Literally every piece of equipment you could ever ask for. I don't usually hit the gym when I'm on vacation but I couldn't resist with the selection of clean and unique machines. \\n\\nThe decor of the entire hotel has always been very inspiring to me over the years. We have begun to recycle more and introduce more nature into our apartment after our visits at the various 1 Hotel locations. \\n\\nWhoever oversees this or manages the 1... PLEASE keep doing what you are doing with these hotels. \\nI look forward to seeing you again soon. \\n\\nSkyler",
            "This is hands down the best hotel and restaurant experience in Toronto! The diversity in their food and beverage offerings was fantastic, catering to every taste and dietary preference with creativity and flair. The rooftop vibe is incredible, offering stunning views of the Toronto skyline, making it the perfect spot to unwind with a drink.\\n\\nWhat truly sets this place apart is the warmth and hospitality of the employees. Everyone from the management, who were frequently present in the lobby and restaurants ensuring everything was perfect, to the rest of the staff, made us feel incredibly welcome. \\n\\nDespite the luxury experience, we found the pricing to be fair compared to other places in downtown Toronto. We'll definitely be back and recommend it to anyone looking for an unforgettable stay",
            "My wife and I booked three nights at 1 Hotel Toronto in early June for a last-minute mini-moon after our original honeymoon plans were derailed by a tropical storm. We picked 1 Hotel because we wanted to treat ourselves and we were intrigued by the rooftop pool (more on that later). \\n\\nBecause TO wasn't originally in the plan, my wife was a bit bummed. We had envisioned relaxing by the ocean with cocktails, not exploring a new city. I reached out to 1 Hotel to see if I could set up something special for her. Alisha from the Concierge responded quickly to my email and helped me coordinate a surprise, custom bouquet of my wife's favorite flowers to be in our room upon arrival. When we got to the room, we realized she also sent complimentary sparkling wine and truffles (thank you, Alisha!!!). This was such a sweet way to welcome us and definitely set the tone for our stay.\\n\\nThe hotel is beautiful and clearly well thought out. Every staff member we interacted with was attentive and helpful. The driver (whose name I'm forgetting!) was particularly great and it was so useful to have access to a car to take us around town from the hotel. \\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving this hotel four stars instead of five is that on two of the three nights we were there the pool was closed for private events. We booked this hotel in part because we wanted to lounge on the rooftop pool and enjoy Harriette's, the bar up there. Yet because of weather,  the only two times we could've used it, we did not have access to it. It would be helpful if the hotel alerted guests proactively to private events that limit access to the amenities we're paying for",
            "The 1Hotel team always raises the bar!  The atmosphere transports all guests into a sanctuary far  away from all the normal daily tasks and chores. \\n\\nThe rooms are designed to make you feel like you are one with nature with a beach not to far away. \\n\\nWe had the pleasure of dining at Harriet\\u2019s RoofTop for dinner. You can see almost a 360 of the toronto skyline. We ordered sushi, waygu, burrata and a multitude of mixed drinks. Nothing disappointed. \\n\\nWe also dined in for brunch and had their eggs Benny and focaccia French toast. All the flavours were amazing. Crazy enough the potatoes and in-house cured bacon stole the shop for me. \\n\\n1Hotel has definitely won me over from the other luxury resorts. They will become by home away from home from now on",
            "Very accommodating on my adjusted arrival and departure times. The woody, clean, and sustainable design of my room made feel very comfortable. \\n\\nA few cool small things that are unique: I liked their \\u201Cdo not disturb\\u201D sign being made of a rock; they also have a wood tab that lets you leave things behind for donation in case you brought too many things. \\n\\nRooftop pool was very inviting with towel service and drinks. \\",
            "I really enjoyed my stay, especially the perks like the complimentary tesla car service provided by Evolve Limousine & Rentals for guests, this service alone is great value and would certainly secure a future stay just for the added benefit of getting around the city (big thanks to Richard and Anthony).  I appreciate the small details ex. rock to show \\\"do not disturb \\\" and the berry water in the lobby, also love the text concierge service.  The espresso martinis from the lobby bar are delicious, special thanks to Beth for the quality service and DJ Kori Hall for a great Saturday night. The only constructive criticism I have is the rooftop pool - operations seems a bit unorganized, and guests of the hotel aren't necessarily prioritized over random walk-ins for the limited seating available. It was difficult to order a drink by the pool and I had to seek out a server several times for water, drink order and seating on the pool chairs. The service was excellent once I found a server and pool attendee (they were kind, polite and tried their best), but I felt like they were overwhelmed or lacked proper support\\u002Fdirection.  Would certainly recommend for single, female travellers, I felt safe and had a positive experience",
            "Everything about this stay was perfect. The whole theming with wooden elements and plants made me feel welcome and relaxed right away. The room was just beautiful, the bathroom with the huge shower exquisite. Only fine materials. Kudos to the decorator. \\nWe had breakfast which was amazing(eggs with kale and buttermilk waffles) and drinks at the rooftop bar(highly recommend the Jojo and the dark side). The service was superior with a lot of complimentary treats (like a Tesla driving service). \\nI would 100% stay again. Keep up the great work",
            "We stayed for a long weekend and enjoyed the many amenities.  Fruit infused water in the lobby most days and filtered water in the sinks\\u002Fshowers is a very nice touch during the summer.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The building can become crowded as there are long-term rentals, a business operating out of the penthouse, a restaurant and small pool area on the roof and only 2 elevators servicing the 15-20 floors (including subterranean",
            "Stayed here for 3 nights recently with two of my girlfriends and we had a fabulous time! We stayed in a two queen room which was plenty of space for the 3 of us and included a lounger and side tables. The toilet was separate from the shower\\u002Fsinks so it made getting ready easier. The bathroom counter is a bit small and there isn\\u2019t a ton of room - so give yourself lots of time for getting ready!  All of the staff were extremely friendly and the location is amazing! The city is so walkable from the hotel. The pool was amazing, the drinks were so good, and the staff were attentive and friendly. Only small complaint about the pool is that the food menu is extremely limited - hard for anyone with any dietary restrictions to eat! As the pool is right outside of Harriet\\u2019s rooftop it would make sense for the hotel to offer the same menu poolside!  Also\\u2026 adding a few more mirrors around the hotel and hotel rooms would be an appreciated extra touch!   Still despite all of this, 100% a 5 star experience and would stay again! It was the perfect getaway\\u2026 the mattress was sooo comfortable and I slept like a log each night",
            "The hotel is really very nice, beautiful open room that was very nicely decked out. The staff though are what makes this place everyone was great and really helpful with everything. Food at the 1 kitchen is excellent and cocktails on the roof top are on poin",
            "I liked my room very much. It\\u2019s we\\u2019ll decorated and comfortable. These days hotels are not so much a place to lay your head, but a place you can immerse yourself in, to eat, hang out, exercise and enjoy yourself. They know this too, which is why they create the ambience they do. Hotels in all sorts of places; Rio, Tokyo; London; New York, have excellent hotels that grant you some level of exclusivity that come with staying at the hotel. They have a beautiful pool deck\\u002Flounge\\u002Froof top, well if you\\u2019re a guest, you are welcome to enjoy. If not a guest, you have to wait in line and maybe get in or not. At the 1 Hotel, not the case. You do not get access to the lounge; you do not get onto the rooftop; you are the same as anyone else even though you are paying $600 a night for a room. No exclusivity. I felt like I was just a person filling a bed. Coming back from dinner, it doesn\\u2019t matter if you want to enjoy a night cap. I found this very frustrating and it did not make me feel like a valued guest",
            "The 1 Hotel is a perfect execution of luxury sustainability. With a full gym and classes available to experience. Great restaurants and a rooftop with a 360 view!! They also have a house car for transportation within the area, but most of the hot spots are within walking distance of the hotel",
            "This hotel is beautiful. The rooftop is amazing. The room I stayed in had a tub and a lounge area that was great for watching tv and working or eating in room. It was not even the highest tier room and was so nice I can\\u2019t imagine wanting anything \\u2018better.\\u2019 I would book this again anytime I\\u2019m in Toronto without hesitation",
            "1Hotel is an awakening of the senses. From the minute you walk in, you can\\u2019t help but to  feel like you have entered a sanctuary within the city. You can\\u2019t help but to take in all the plants, natural elements and signature scent to set the mood for a relaxing stay. My husband and I stayed in room 319 and it was beyond our expectations. The room was spacious and had a walk out terrace. The bathroom has heated floors and the concrete bathtub was as luxurious as they come. The Bamford products are now my new favourite. We loved all the attention to detail in our room to help make our stay feel like home. Everyone was super friendly and attentive from the front desk to the valet. The hotel has a beautiful roof top restaurant and pool with great views of the city. The lounge is beautiful and the cocktails amazing, especially their old fashion. The gym is well appointed with everything you need including Peloton bikes. We had a fabulous breakfast at 1Kitchen and we loved that they had gluten and dairy free options. We highly recommend this hotel- nothing big chain and impersonal about it"

            "Exceptional and almost up there with the fastiduously superb hotel 41 in London, or, a favourite, the Charlotte St hotel in Fitzrovia, London. We stayed 2 nights for an anniversary and the staff could not have done more to help make our stay a wonderful experience. Unfortunately the affiliated Georges restaurant was shut the evenings we stayed (Sun\\u002FMon) but we were recomended a superb local steak house (Berberians) and the Georges Lunch on Monday was excellent. \\n\\nOverall a really fabulous stay and our only suggestions would be to put some cheap pens or pencils in the room to note down stuff without having to rummage through the executive carrier bags!\\n\\nOverall a rare gem, but we did feel that it needs to communicate a clear proposition; as a fabulous boutique hotel, a fine dining experience, a club,a ladies health spa, or,  all 4",
            "My husband and I received an 'Urban Retreat' package as a wedding gift, and were blown away by this hotel and The George Restaurant when we finally got around to booking and coming for a little getaway.\\nThe service was phenomenal (front desk, spa and George restaurant!), the food amazing, the room gorgeous and unique.. so many little details were attended to. We are definitely going to give this as a gift to a family member who is getting married in the fall.\\n*the only tiny thing I'd say that could be improved is the coffee they served us in the morning. It tasted sort of musty and wasn't very warm",
            "I absolutely love the Ivy Hotel and have stayed there several times.  It is a perfect retreat for a romantic get away with your partner and there are several packages available which include dinner at the hotel's George Restaurant.   I have also used the Ivy when having a girls' day with my sister, niece and mom at the adjacent Sweetgrass Spa and an evening out so the room was nice to come back to.   In addition, I have used the Ivy for business purposes if I book a corporate dinner at George or have meetings downtown the next day, the Ivy is conveniently situated in the downtown core.   The 4 room boutique hotel is luxurious and cozy with a unique ambience.  The staff and service is attentive. I am already looking forward to my next stay",
            "The Ivy isn\\u00B4t so much a classical hotel. It\\u00B4s a business club with serveral nice meeting lounges, a lady fitness studio, a spa and perhaps the best restaurant \\\"George\\\" I have ever eaten at. We were told - also there was no one, when we we stayed - that the Ivy is a hot spot for weddings in Toronto. And I can understand this.\\n\\nThe rooms - they only have four, so feel yourself luck if you get one - are big and lovely decorated, with over king size beds which might be the most comfortable I ever had sleeped in, a big bath - seperated shower and closet - with Bulgari toiletries and several different bathing salts available for disposal in the big bathing tube.\\n\\nThe breakfast - croissant, cake, fresh fruit and juice, coffee or tea, everything excellent - was offered on tray outside the room on an old french pastries table and had to be carried in your room. We ate it on our balcony with view to the patio. Great start of the day. Coffee (Nespresso) and softdrinks were complimentary the whole day. \\n\\nThe hotel itself is very central, probably 10 min walk to Eaton Center with a subway station just around the corner and big public parking space on the other side of the street.\\n \\nSo go there, even if you don\\u00B4t want to mary",

There\\u2019s even a lovely patio so you feel you might be away from the downtown heart of the city. Sherry and cookies await your arrival. We\\u2019ve travelled around the world, and this might be the most imaginatively and beautiful lodging. Bed and linens, of course, are without parallel.\\n\\nHighly recommended. \\n\\nStaff is helpful too.\\n\\nWe would definitely retur",
            "My husband and I have stayed at the Ivy at Verity twice as an overnight getaway in the city. Each time we purchased a package which included one massage, dinner for 2 at George (restaurant associated with Verity), room and breakfast. The package offers excellent value. The rooms are beautiful (especially the bathrooms) and everything is elegant and luxurious. Food at George is excellent. We have food allergies and restrictions that the chef has always accomodated. We find that the chef has a preference for fois gras which we find too heavy so we make sure to ask the staff to exclude this. We've been to the Hyatt in downtown Toronto and prefer the Ivy to it",
            "We very much anticipated our stay based on the reputation and prior reviews of the Ivy at Verity.  We were there for our anniversary and one of us had never been to Toronto before.  We did not eat at George so cannot comment on that.\\nThe good:  huge room, comfortable bed, and amazing bathroom.  The room faces the courtyard, so away from the noise of the street (more on that later). \\nStaff we met seemed friendly - though really limited contact with staff since you enter and leave through a different entrance than the \\\"lobby\\\".   The included breakfast tray was nice with coffee,  croissants, yogurt, and fruit.\\nThe bad:  while the location is close to everything one might want to see in downtown Toronto, the Ivy is a few blocks east of Yonge St. and it gets kind of seedy - think pawn shops and a few unsavory characters.  We never felt unsafe, but it is not in an upscale neighborhood.  Our second night was very quiet and peaceful.  The first night will be discussed below.  The third night was notable for moderately loud music from the \\\"secret bar\\\" (we think).  Fortunately this stopped around 11 pm.  Another \\\"bad\\\" - no clothing storage in the room to speak of, so you will be living out of your suitcase.  Strange that there are no dressers or drawers given the large size of the room.  There is a closet for hanging items.  Also under the \\\"bad\\\" - there is no parking and so if you have driven there you must find a public garage and they have a strange system of payment.  You cannot just enter, get a ticket and pay when you leave for your entire time.  Rather, you need to pay every morning and evening or just get a ticket and pay that.  Pricing though is not bad compared to major US cities.\\nThe \\\"ugly\\\":  our first night we went to Pompette for a very nice anniversary dinner.  Upon arrival back at the Ivy at 10:30 pm there was very loud music from a wedding reception downstairs.  Not just very loud, but the furniture and wall hangings were rattling with the beat of the bass.  Obviously it was impossible to sleep.  At about 11:35 pm I called the front desk to complain and ask about when the loud noise would stop.  I was dismayed to hear that it would continue until 12:30 am and upset when they suggested that we were  warned about it at check-in.  Not only were we not warned about it at check-in, we were not told about it when we booked.  We might have chosen a different lodging had we known about this.  To be fair, the manager of George called us the next day and was apologetic.  He brought us a. bottle of wine which was nice, but the service recovery did not make up for the disapointment that the seemingly peaceful setting was anything but.\\",
            "My husband and I stay in Toronto every few months so like to try different hotels each time. Recent stays have included Intercontinental Yorkville, Pantages, and Ritz-Carlton. For our latest stay, we booked a room at The Ivy at Verity. I can honestly say I've never had a more lovely hotel stay! The staff seemed very proud to work there and were both warm and professional.\\nThe room we stayed in (Room 1) was large and beautifully appointed ... The care they've put into decorating each room is apparent in every fabric and furniture choice. The bed was luxuriously comfortable and the bathroom spoiled us with heated floors, marble vanity and a selection of aromatherapy bath salts. \\nThe common area immediately outside the rooms is a charming space with a large granite table used for drinks in the afternoon and breakfast in the morning. Alcohol was $6 a drink (very reasonable) and done on the honour system...all the drinks were out on the table and you filled out a card with what you drank to bring to the concierge later for payment. Espresso and soda was free as was the wifi and a continental breakfast. That breakfast was also delicious! Large flaky, buttery croissants, yoghurt and granola, hard boiled eggs, and juice were waiting on trays labelled with each room number and you simply rang the concierge to have fresh coffee delivered when you woke up.  \\nI didn't want to leave! I can't wait to try this hotel in the summer and enjoy the lovely terrace.\\nWell done, Ivy... You've created a little oasis in the heart of the city",
            "My wife and I celebrated our 6th wedding anniversary in July and booked a room at the Ivy and dinner at George.  The hotel and restaurant were amazing. I have stayed at other upscale hotels in Toronto like the Trump and I think the Ivy is excellent value for the price and the service is terrific. We stayed in room #4 which was very spacious and faced a beautiful courtyard. I definitely would stay here again",
            "It's official--The Ivy at Verity is now my new favourite hotel in all of Toronto. From the moment I was greeted at the front door to the morning I left I felt incredibly welcomed and spoiled. The rooms are beautifully decorated and luxurious, I appreciated the self serve open bar set-up outside my door and can't even describe how amazing my meal at the George restaurant was. Incredible experience. I would (and will) highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Toronto from now on. Amazing accommodations",
            "This is a little lovely hotel. It is close to Eaton Center and close to the Hop on Hop off busses.\\nDe service is excellent and the people are very nice. If I come back to Toronto I would stay there again.\\nCompliments for this hotel\\u002Fbed and breakfast",
            "On the positive, The Ivy is a lovely, tiny (it only has 4 rooms) boutique hotel in Toronto.  The room we had was luxurious and huge, as was the bathroom and bed! \\n\\nThe bathroom had a separate shower and bath and the toilet was in a separate cubicle within the bathroom. There was a range of three bath salts to choose from!\\n\\nHowever, we found the breakfast to be a little hit and miss given we ordered practically the same things on both days but the quantities varied between the two days.  Also it would have been nice if someone had knocked on the door to let us know breakfast had been served (this would be common practice in the UK) so on the first day it took us 5-10 mins to realise the tray had been delivered by which time my hot water wasn't quite so hot.  When we did realise breakfast was there we found that there were no cups or milk. When we phoned reception we were advised there would be some in the lounge which no-one had told us about :-(\\n\\nWhilst we found the hotel to be close enough to many attractions (we walked to most places) and only 5 mins from a metro station we did feel it was a little out of the way and not the most salubrious district.\\n\\nGiven that The Ivy is within a ladies-only club and, as I was with my husband, we didn't use any of the other hotel facilities as they weren't available to him however, we were aware of this when we booked. \\n\\nOverall, it is a lovely hotel and feels very opulent once you are in the building itself. The staff were lovely and it was a good start to our first trip to Canada",
            "We had an excellent time here. The massage package with the room for two can be used by one person for the full hour by a RMT therapist. The breakfast consisted of coffee, a choice of freshly squeezed juice, pastry's, fresh fruit offered on a tray outside of your room. They have a small area to sit or you can bring your tray to your room.\\nThe hallways are so confusing of how to get to your room or even how to get to the reception area, although they were very accommodating to help you find your way. It was a nice treat with the spa downstairs for the following day.\\nVery close to the Eaton Centre. A great part of the city. It truly was a welcomed treat",
            "My daughter (age 15) and I stayed for one night at the Ivy as part of a March Break getaway. We are from Toronto and wanted one night downtown while we shopped at the Eaton Centre and went to the AGO. Our room was beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Next time, we will add in a trip to the Spa. Very luxurious - Highly recommend",
            "We just left Toronto and loved our stay at the Ivy at Verity. The hotel is at a women's club and there are only four rooms, so taxi drivers tour buses, etc may not be familiar with it. Just made us more thankful we found this hidden gem. We actually stayed in two different rooms for our two night stay (2 and 4). Both were very specious, with large balconies, tasteful decor, and lots of natural light. The beds were super comfortable and it was very cozy and upscale at the same time. The bathrooms were huge. The staff was very responsive and helpful, particularly George. They provided a simple breakfast and were very eager to help with any questions we had. A great place for a couples getaway. We also enjoyed appetizers in the club's lounge and were very impressed with the quality of the food",
            "Not only our favorite place in Toronto, the Ivy at Verity is one of the nicest and most perfects hotels we have ever stayed at.  My mom and I, who take a trip every year, enjoyed the spacious and intricately decorated Room # 3.  Everything was spotless, comfortable, and beautiful.  Every detail of this \\\"hotel\\\" (more like an oasis) was designed and thought through.  I oftentimes found myself wanting to return to the Ivy and other areas of Verity (Sweetgrass Spa, Member's lounge, Library, Computer area) to lounge in the chairs, hang out on the room's large private patio, have a drink at the private honor bar, or take a dip in the pool or bath (prepared with salts and tea preparations).  The concierge was available 24hrs and extremely kind and helpful in accommodating any of our needs or desires, altering our daily delivered breakfasts, making reservations and offering suggestions catered to our likes, and personally introducing us to the host at George Restaurant before our reservation.  We cannot say enough good things about the Ivy\\u002FVerity\\u002FSweetgrass Spa, where you can find every amenity at high quality, spectacular service, and a beautiful ambience.  It is private but alive, and suited for a getaway, for business, and for romance.  With an entrance through Verity, as well as a private entrance (with secure coded door) for the rooms, a guest can customize his\\u002Fher stay.  The location was central to many places such as a few blocks from the subway, or a walk to St. Lawrence Market\\u002FDundas.  We cannot wait to return and could have enjoyed many more days at the Ivy at Verity!  Thank you for a wonderful experience",
            "I found the Ivy on hotels.com. Thought it sounded unique and it is! Four gorgeously and differently appointed rooms. Huge bathroom with rain shower and deep soaking tub, including in-house-made, complimentary bath salts - a nice touch after a long day of walking. There is an honor bar with white wine, liquors, and soft drinks. Also tea bags and instant coffee. Continental breakfast is included and it is quite ample - yogurt\\u002Fgranola, boiled egg, croissant or muffin, juices, and coffee\\u002Fcream. Really nice.\\n\\nThe only difficulty that I encountered was a previously unannounced electricity outage one night from 10pm to 4am the following morning. WEIRD. A letter left in my room. No explanation. Battery lantern and flashlight provided. \\n\\nThe building is in a sort of run-down block of Queen St just a bit east of the better parts of Queen St West. But I did not feel unsafe. \\n\\nThere is a great women's clothing store a few doors down. Don't miss it! And an excellent antiques store in the the next block east. Plenty of good restaurants a block or two away as well as the upscale George attached.\\n\\nLovely subterranean swimming pool and hot tub. And a spa",
            "We stayed here after our wedding before going home to Etobicoke, and I am so happy that we did! We arrived late (about 1am?) and the concierge was there to greet us and take a breakfast order. The room was well-appointed - beautiful furniture, gorgeous lighting, a patio overlooking the courtyard.  The bed was easily the most comfortable I've ever slept on in my life. And the bathroom! HUGE tub, heavenly salts, separate toilet and shower stalls... just to die for. Breakfast was juice, coffee\\u002Ftea, pastries, yogurt & fruit -- and was waiting on a tray for us in the lobby area which also had a nice bar to choose from (though we weren't in the mood to take advantage of it seeing as it was 9am). I would recommend this place to everyone",
            "I wouldn't have even known this was their unless we were staying there as part of a wedding party, but it was truly a special little oasis in the city.  The room was massive by inner city standards.  There was a king size bed, little sitting are for reading and another one with a little table for eating\\u002Fdrinks.   There was also a large patio with a table overlooking a quiet courtyard.  Never once did it sound like we were in a city.  The bathroom was also huge and had a great assortment of quality soaps including 3 different scents of bath salts.   Room included a continental breakfast.  There also was an open area outside the room with complimentary soft drinks and cocktails for fee.  Would highly recommend this quiet, gem in the city",
            "The Ivy at Verity is a tiny hotel. The set up seems odd at first... it is an exclusive women's club with gym, spa, library, lounges etc, and tucked away on a upper floor, the 4 lovely and spacious guest rooms.  The rooms overlook a court yard and face the windows of an ad agency, where you can see folks working away. At first it felt a bit like we were in a bedroom at work. We kept our drapes closed and all was well. As a woman, all of the amenities were amazing. I think if I had been travelling with a male companion it would have been disappointing.  I was in room three and it was BEAUTIFUL.  Just my style. Very comfortable king bed, incredible bathroom with an irresistible bathtub. All of the soaps and salts and lotions were really lovely and great quality. The room had lots of plush seating, and huge balcony. The honour bar, just outside of the rooms was a really nice touch - although when I was there it was not properly stocked and was never replenished, even after two calls to the concierge. Location is central enough to walk downtown, has a transit stop right out front, and there is paid parking directly across the street. I thought the breakfast was quite good. This will always be my first choice hotel when I stay in Toronto, I really loved it",
            "We absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was so welcoming and helpful. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was perfect. \\nThis hotel is owned by the women's club and was originally used exclusively by the club for when they had guests in town. Now anyone can book a room if you are lucky enough to nab one. There are only four rooms in the entire hotel and they are separated away from the rest of the club so it is very quiet. The rooms are very large with a king bed and beautiful full wall windows with a door onto a private balcony. Each room is color coded and unique. the bathroom comes with heated floors, a separate room for the toilet, an amazing shower, and the largest bath tub I have ever seen. I am 6'2\\\" and I could stretch out in the tub with room to spare. The added bonus is the in house made bath salt that they provide in three different scents.\\nYou also get breakfast delivered to your door. It is not a large meal but it gets you through to lunch. \\nThe last thing I have to say is that you MUST have dinner at George while you are there. This restaurant specializes in tasting menus for all dietary plans. The biggest benefit is that after your three hour multi -course meal you just have to walk up the hidden staircase to your room (never leaving the building). \\nI will definitely stay here again if ever back in Toronto",
            "I am fortunate enough to be a member of the club and the room happened to be available that evening. Ivy is an experience everyone should have. It is truly a hidden gem within downtown Toronto. You are in heaven in downtown Toronto! Peaceful, stunning rooms, incredible service, fantastic atmosphere, luxury and pampering at its best.\\n\\nWhat made me incredibly sad though was that they don't allow dogs; that's about the worst thing I can say :(\\n\\nIf you are lucky enough to be able to get in you would be crazy to pass up on the opportunity!\\n\\nL",
            "Definitely not your usual hotel. Looking for a home away your home.....This is the place where to go when you are in Toronto. Even if not located in some fancy neighborhoods, this place is a gem. At first a \\\"Women's club\\\" , the Ivy offers some rooms now... Mine was .. Yes ... awesome. A large room with a large bed, a pretty big bathroom with for the first time ever of my life a bath salt \\\"bar\\\" ... Breakfast it serve at your door at the requested time. Might be a little bit light (missing some toasts and butter), ordered croissants and chocolate brioche and ends-up with a muffin with grapes   ... But this was good.\\nTeam is great ... I will highly recommend this place ... Especially if you are a woman ... Next time i will try the SPA",
            "The Ivy at Verity has a lot of charm. Located in an old chocolate factory, the interior of the hotel as well as our room had been given a lot of attention to detail. Our room was decorated in a warm and lush way and the amenities were great such as the selection of home made bath salts. Service was also good and friendly. The bed, manufactured by the world famous Hastens bed manufacturer, was superb: one of the best beds we have ever slept in (apart from home...). There were a couple of drawbacks which you might want to take into account when booking this hotel:\\n\\n- It is located in not the best part of Toronto with a lot of homeless people on the streets.\\n- The hotel does not provide their own parking facilities. There is a municipal parking lot just across the street but quite expensive ($ 24 overnight) and not guarded, and a parking garage closeby (however, our SUV couldn't enter as the maximum height was 2 meters).\\n- There is no hotel entrance parking nor a porter service so for the not too light traveller somewhat inconvenient because of the busy street.\\n- The balcony is located at the back and the adjacent building has huge airconditioning vents that make a lot of noise which is not so nice when you want to enjoy a glass of wine outside your room. The same by the way applies to the patio of the George restaurant which you can overlook from the balcony and that is right under these vents. We cannot imagine this to be a nice dinner experience hence we didn't try it and ate elsewhere.\\n\\nThere is a turn-down service but it follows kind of strict timings so one night when we went out for dinner at about 9.30 housekeeping was not able to do this. Our dvd player turned out not to function which was a pity as we wanted to watch a dvd we received after one of us doing the CN tower edgewalk. All in all a very nice boutique hotel but with some areas of attention in terms of location",
            "The Ivy at Verity ( a private women's club in downtown Toronto) attached to 5 star dining at George Restaurant with it's own private courtyard patio.\\nPosh but cozy, exclusive but welcoming. So beautiful and stylish but with plenty of substance. The people are warm and helpful and the beds are Hastens so the best sleep ever acheived. There is a Verity spa (complete with hot tub, steam room, and sauna ) on property called Sweetgrass that is exclusive for women but men staying in the hotel can have treatments in their hotel room. They even have fitness facilities (again, exclusive to women)  and you can add on a yoga class if you want for a nominal fee.\\nFabulous stay, incredible bed, God is here, in the deails",
            "The Ivy is a little off the beaten track in Toronto but the room and especially bathroom was worth the walk! Breakfast and services were superb. \\nChoose the Ivy if you are into boutique hotels, luxury - and not up for B&Bs or big hotels. This place is something special",
            "The rooms at the Ivy are so beautiful, you really don't want to leave them.  Save time to enjoy the spa like bath, with an assortment of scented salts and heated floors - enjoy a drink or breakfast on the balcony overlooking the secluded patio of the George restaurant - and make sure you get your full eight hours sleep in the heavenly beds - amazing comfort and luxury.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, each one with a different interior design, and unlike anything you would get at a large chain hotel.  Within walking distance of downtown Toronto, the Ivy is conveniently located albeit off the beaten path.  We liked being able to enjoy a bottle of champagne in the seating area outside the rooms as a group - almost like being in your own home - before heading downstairs to the wonderful George restaurant. Personal and knowledgable concierge staff - access to Internet and computers - on site spa - and ambience from the exclusive Verity Women's Club.  I have stayed at the Ivy many times, and already am looking forward to my next visit",
            "We live in Toronto, but I surprised my husband with  here for one night on our wedding anniversary in April 2014.  He had no idea there were even rooms at the Verity and was excited (perhaps unnecessarily) that we were visiting a \\\"ladies club\\\" for our anniversary, ha ha. Our experience was so positive from start to finish. It's such a little gem. Our room rivalled any hotel room we've been to around the world--gorgeous huge bathroom, comfy beds, beautiful amenties. The honour bar was lovely too, so quaint. Staff were excellent..rooms were beautifully maintained, well cleaned, front desk staff was attentive etc. My husband had in in room massage and I had a manicure downstiars--the BEST it lasted for over a week!)--plus one of the ladies gave me a make up lesson at the fun\\u002Finteractive make up bar. Spa is really lovely.  Then we had a great dinner at George (food was out of this world although the waiter was a bit haughty). Overall I would highly recommend the Ivy and the package we had. A great escape in the city",
            "OMG. This is a boutique hotel with only 4 rooms in it. The service, facilities and the rooms are amazing to say the least. What a great gem in Toronto. We're looking forward to returning the next time that we're in Toronto. Everything was perfect",
            "We actually found this place through Hotels.com, it had very high ratings which were confirmed on Trip Adviser. The place is amazing, we would absolutely stay there again. The room was incredible, I had ordered flowers from their in-house florist for the room, they were in room at check-in, my wife LOVED them! Right colours and had opened up to where we were able to enjoy them during our stay. We cannot say enough about the bed, was the BEST we have ever slept in, and we have a Tempurpedic. Bathroom was a dream room, large tub, oversize shower and heated floors. What we loved most, this was a Romantic getaway for us, we felt like we were the only ones in the place. The only way we knew there were other guests was by the 3 other breakfast trays on the table waiting to be picked up in the morning. You cannot beat the location, 2 blocks from Eaton's Centre and the Subway, a quick 10 minute walk to the St. Lawrence Market. We had only minor issues, when we checked in I was handed back my driver's license but not my credit card. Spent the morning worrying if I had lost it, only to find out that it was at reception. They apologized and said they did not want to disturb us with a call, HELLO call, slip a note under the door, something! One review mentions vacuuming in the middle of the night, we heard that too, at about midnight right above our room, very loud but only for a few minutes. This was on the Friday night, not Sat or Sun. One last thing, when we checked in the concierge took our breakfast order, asked what time we wanted the nightly bed turn down and what time we wanted the room made up. Each day Housekeeping did not have the room made up until 2-3 hours after the time we had requested. In the grand scheme of things these were minor issues that are easily corrected. They will not influence our choosing to stay there again when we return to Toronto. A true gem",
            "I've been staying in Marriotts, Hiltons and Holiday Inns for over 4 years with work, but it's only by coming to The Ivy that I'm reminded how good a hotel experience you can have if you go to the boutique places.\\nThe first thing is even though this is effectively 'an old boys club for women', my wife booked it for our first trip to Toronto and we both found it to be utterly beautiful, relaxing and a joy to stay in. We could happily move into room 3 and never leave, the bed and bathroom are brilliant, the honesty bar and espresso machine outside the room make you feel at home to come and go as you please, the staff were super friendly and helpful, and even though the spa is women only they allowed us in after hours. As for the George restaurant, we've never had a better tasting menu anywhere in the world. A rare foodie experience I'll not forget in a hurry.\\nOne of those places that genuinely nourishes your body and mind. Can't say enough good things about it",
            "We live in Toronto and were celebrating- my birthday, my husbands birthday and my best friend's and her husband's birthday all fall within a month of each other, so we decided this year to celebrate in style- a night at the Ivy. We kicked things off first at the Sweetgrass spa (for women only) then enjoyed a 10 course tasting menu on George's beautiful courtyard patio.\\n \\nGoing with another couple allowed me to gawk at their room too (room #1). I love how this hotel has only four rooms and all are tasteful and elegant, and so different. Our room (#3) was a glamorous blend of modern mixed with classic timeless materials, a nod to their chocolate factory past. Gorgeous blue wallpaper is charming against the relic brick of a bygone era. The rooms themselves are massive, much roomier than any other downtown hotel I've seen. With different seating areas to recline and relax, including a sunny deck that faces George's patio, my husband and I loved every minute of our stay. The bathroom has a super deep soaker tub and inviting aromatic bath salts- they have clearly anticipated your every thought! \\nOne feature I loved was the Samsung tablet that you use to control the television, but also acts as a portable TV, which they have linked to Netflix...cue the Orange is the New Black marathon! \\n\\nMy bestie's room was an intimate portrait of a Parisian hotel, soft pink striped wallpaper was welcoming and warm. Her room was every bit as luxurious as mine, every detail carefully constructed. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back, absolutely adore the staff, spa and restaurant here. It's a rare gem in a city full of over-done, over hyped hotels (IMHO). Nice gestures like the honour bar and delicious complimentary breakfast are just the finishing touches to a spoiled brat weekend. Thanks Ivy",
            "I have not one complaint about this hotel. It is beautiful, and stunningly decorated. There are only four rooms, with private balconies, and they are clean and luxurious. Incredibly comfortable beds\\u002Fpillows. Gorgeous bathrooms with Bvlgari shampoos&ody washes. The Verity contains several meeting rooms, a library, and an all-womans' spa (odd, right?!). The staff was very kind, and helpful. We checked in late, our in-room safe didn't work, and they replaced it immediately. Another front desk manager (Michael?) went out of his way to help us find affordable transportation to an out-of-the way concert that we were trying to attend. We had a complimentary continental breakfast, which was delivered to the \\\"honor bar\\\" outside of the guest rooms. (I have never had freshly pressed cranberry juice!!). The George Restaurant, which is, essentially, below the guest rooms (though, we were never disturbed by the diners) is absolutely fabulous!!!!!!\\nMy only complaint is that this hotel is on a rather seedy section of the street. The downtown  location is ideal for great restaurants (Origin, Blowfish on Bay, Canoe), and Toronto highlights, it seems out of place. There are several, what appear to be, homeless shelters within a block of the hotel. East Queen Street seemed to have a constant flow of indigent people flowing in, and out, of the McDonalds on the corner. I felt a little uncomfortable walking back each night, and I am from NYC. We never had any issues, but it struck me as odd that this gem of a hotel was in the wrong neighborhood.",
            "I had the chance to stay here during one of my trip to Toronto. A very nice and classy hotel. The service quality is excellent, the room warm, beautiful and the staff very friendly. I definitely recommend it",
            "My wife and I took a recent holiday to Canada and started the holiday by staying at the Ivy at Verity for our first 4 nights.This is a quirky boutique style hotel situated just outside downtown Toronto. Based in what was once a chocolate factory this hotel only has four rooms but has extensive accommodation which is used for conferences etc.The rooms are beautifully furnished each with a different theme and each has an outside balcony overlooking an inner courtyard.The bathroom in particular was quite spectacular and the bedroom very spacious.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.Continental breakfast was not extensive but more than adequate and good quality.The hotel was very quiet and in a good position to reach both the hop on hop off bus service on foot and for access to the various downtown areas on foot.Plenty of restaurants in the vicinity.Highly recommended",
            "This centrally located downtown Toronto hotel is extremely spacious, beautifully appointed and impeccably conceived. I'd like to move in. (The continental breakfast delivered to your door, the heated flooring in the very large bathroom, the generous balcony overlooking the intimate brick courtyard, the gorgeous drapes and furniture...) And yes, of course, all the technology required for a 21st century traveler",
            "The Ivy is a wonderful boutique hotel in downtown Toronto.  Everything in the room is top notch from the overall spaciousness of the room, the decor, the walk-in shower room, the deep soaking tub, upscale ammenities etc.  The staff were attentive and accommodating and helped make our stay a great one.  We would recommend this hotel highly to anyone",
            "Love this place, love Toronto.  Been here 3x in the past year and will be returning soon.  Beautiful retreat.  Wonderful to walk downstairs to George for dinner, to the spa for a massage, or up the street to the subway to get around the city.  Staff is first rate, attentive, and respectful of my privacy. It's expensive but the price is fair",
            "This boutique hotel is exactly that. Small, but beautifully put together. Staff were all fantastic. Rooms perfect. Best bathrooms we've found in Canada, and when the weather allows a lovely veranda to sit on. Attached is a ladies health club and spa, and if I lived in Toronto I would join. Can you start one in England  - preferably near where I live \\uD83D\\uDE04 Husband and I had a champagne breakfast to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was lovely",
            "This hotel is part of a small, elegant upscale spa and restaurant complex and women's club. The restaurant is superior as are the spa facilities and the rooms.  Decoration is in impeccable taste in every part of the complex.  The beds are British--Hypnos is the brand.  They are ultra-luxury in price; more importantly, they make for an exceptional sleep. We had a perfect escape to an elegant oasis in the middle of Toronto in the winter.  Highly recommended",
            "This is a very small hotel with only 4 rooms in a old building. It was our last stop on our holidays in Canada and we did enjoy it a lot. The room is very nicely done and does also have a great terrace. There are many small details which are great and show the attention to details. The quality of the room is very high and the staff makes the stay also a great experience. \\nThe hotel also features a women\\u2018s only spa and a gourmet restaurant. \\n\\nThe location of the hotel is also great to explore Toronto without a car",
            "Found this hotel on Expedia, and the more I read I about it, the more curious I got, as it was 'boutique' and 'euro influenced'. I booked it based on reviews and that it would be perfect for my wedding anniversary. After arriving, it surpassed our expectations. The room's were fantastic, very spacious and clean with a balcony, the decor was in great taste, the bed was great,  the food at their neighbour restaurant 'George' was fantastic, and the staff (in particular George and Jen) made every effort to make our stay enjoyable. I was so relaxed by the time I checked out of the hotel, that I forgot my laptop cord, and within 2hrs, I had an email from the staff letting me know that I left it behind. It's a great hotel which Toronto should be proud of",
            "We stayed at the Ivy for one night -- our honeymoon -- and it was fantastic. It is truly an oasis in the heart of downtown Toronto and you will be pampered! The beds are so plush, you will not want to get out of bed. We especially enjoyed the very spacious and stylish bathrooms, especially the very large and lovely soaking tub and showers. Can't wait to go back",
            "Spent a wonderful weekend in Toronto at The Ivy at Verity.  A boutique hotel with just 4 rooms. Our was beautifully decorated, spacious with an amazing bathroom.   They have thought of everything -- honor bar, round the clock concierge and unique touches like freshly brewed tea to enjoy while you soak in a huge tub soaking in specially chosen bath salts.   It was a truly magical experience.   Can't imagine every staying anywhere else in Toronto.   Book ahead so you won't miss out",
            "The Ivy is a hidden gem in the centre of Toronto.  Spacious beautifully decorated rooms, luxurious linens and the bathrooms are stocked with the best toiletries - a deep bath and separate shower stall.  You  feel pampered and regenerated.  Great dinner package options at George restaurant and spa options at the spa. Small and personal - treat yourself",
            "We stayed here for an evening and had dinner at George restaurant.  What a fabulous experience.  If you are travelling to Toronto, it is walking distance to the financial district, Yonge Street, the Eaton Center shopping mall and great restaurants.  The room was sooo cozy, heated flooring, spacious bathrooms with various scented bath salts, contemporary design.  The breakfast in the morning was right outside the door and we enjoyed eatting in bed.  Dinner at George was AMAZING.  The food, the service were top notch.  I highly recommend it.  There are only a few rooms, each one is decorated differently.  The spa though is women only, so sorry guys. If you are looking for a boutique hotel that is cozy, in a great location and can splurge, Verity is for you",
            "We chose the Ivy's Urban Retreat package for one night as a way to celebrate our anniversary in Toronto. In the city, there are no shortage of luxury hotel options, but it can be difficult to find a place to stay that is really in the \\\"boutique\\\" category while offering privacy, luxury, fun, and peace while away from home. In just about every category for evaluation, the Ivy excels. This 4-room hotel downtown stands out and above other options in Toronto, and we're thrilled to have discovered it.\\n\\nYou can request a particular room when booking, and we chose room #2. With a calming colour scheme, plenty of space, a gorgeous marble bathroom (deep tub and huge shower room!), and a large flat screen with a blu-ray player, it's well-outfitted, comfortable, and very quiet. You have access to a refreshments area with honour bar and complimentary soft drinks, as well as access to the members only lounge area, which we didn't make use of. Their packages have incredible value, and we had the chance to enjoy an included five-course meal at the onsite George restaurant and an hour long massage at the onsite Sweetgrass spa. \\n\\nTo clarify some confusion amongst the reviews and elsewhere, Verity is the parent company here and responsible for the spa and restaurant, as well as the hotel. The spa (and this includes all available fitness facilities) is women only, but this absolutely does not mean that men are somehow unwelcome. In fact, should you wish, men can request in-room spa services. As a male guest, I absolutely loved my stay here, and my partner was able to make use of the beautiful spa facilities. \\n\\nToronto seems to be a city where it can be difficult to feel as if value matches cost for accommodations. The Ivy at Verity bucks this unfortunate trend and offers an experience we hope to someday return for",
            "I stayed at this hotel on business when my normal go-to options (Park Hyatt, Shangri-La, and Ritz) were fully booked.  I was nervous about trying a boutique hotel in Toronto in a neighborhood I was less-familiar with, but it paid off.  I instantly fell in love with this hotel and have recommended it now to at least 20 people.  I was in town attending a luxury travel tradeshow as I am in hotel sales.  Everyone, even the locals were surprised to hear about this little gem.  Service, decor, and overall concept were all above average!  I loved that it was designed with women in mind",
            "Strange setting, 4 room hotel inside a women's only networking club in central Toronto.\\nSet in a beautifully renovated industrial complex, the room was a treat to the senses, salts for the bath, special wood floors in the bathroom. Everything about the room was perfect. We also had a beautiful little terrace overlooking a courtyard where we had breakfast.\\nThe affiliated George restaurant was also magnificent, and all the staff was attentive and knowledgable.\\nI loved the place.\\nI'll definitely go back",
            "Amazing getaway in the heart of Toronto.  Great location, only four rooms in the entire hotel, gorgeous boardrooms, library, balconies.  The hotel rooms are enormous, luxurious, romantic and spotless.  The spa downstairs is just for women (which was kind of wonderful) but the male half of a couple might feel a little left out.  Then he should remind himself that he gets paid more than his wife does to do the same job\\u2026 and go relax in the giant bathtub instead"

            "Loved this location as it was so perfectly located. Bloor Street, St Lawrence Market, Eaton Plaza, Church Street, everything was in walking distance and I loved being so central. The staff was super friendly, always helpful, and the room\\u002Fbeds were very comfortable. All very good",
            "Location is king when searching for a hotel, but the quality of the rooms will make or break your decision to book. The room had a great design and was comfortable. The hotel smelled amazing! The Anndore House was perfectly tucked away for a sound night of sleep, but centrally located that allowed easy movement across the city",
            "In Toronto to see Harry Potter and The Cursed Child. Chose the Anndore House because of its proximity to the Bloor subway station and it is pet friendly. Upon arrival we were asked if a pet bed and bowls were needed for our dog which was a pleasant surprise and greatly appreciated. There is no parking on site but there is a municipal parking garage directly across with reasonable rates. Room was very clean and check in \\u002Fout was very easy and staff were very friendly. Will definitely choose The Anndore House for any future travels to Toront",
            "Stayed one night with family. Homeless encampment outside made me nervous. Valet parking cost $45, Public parking garage over the road cost $27 for 14 hours. Nearby MacDonalds and Tim Hortons for breakfast. Very downtown vibe with all the riff-raff around. The room itself was clean and quiet. Room card needed to activate the elevator so that kept undesirables out",
            "Had no idea what to expect for an uptown hotel, but this was a sheer delight. The staff were very welcoming even though we were late due to flight delays. The room was very clean and the decor had a wonderful quirky vibe almost straight out of 1920's film noir set. Valet service was excellent. Both guys we talked to were very friendly. Had breakfast here every morning, only small selection, but designed to fulfill all the necessary food groups to fil you up for the rest of the day. Didn't eat here in the evening as there were so many other restaurants nearby to choose from. It is located one block from the Metro Line 1, so easy to get downtown and 2 blocks from all the major car hire firms rental collection and return depot under the shopping mall.\\n\\nWould recommend this to anyone",
            "The location is fantastic, with loads of food options in the area, and a short walk from both the TTC and Yorkville. Public parking right across the street at a decent rate was also appreciated. The staff were helpful, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The cocktails at the Constantine Restaurant on the first floor were great as well, I'd definitely be back",

            "Stayed here recently on business and had a King Loft room on one of the upper floors. Room was well appointed, clean and perfectly acceptable. Had all the amenities you could want and everything worked fine. Room was serviced daily to a high standard. I didn't notice noise coming from any of the other rooms on my floor, even though there were many other people on the floor - also, I was up high enough to not be bothered by the street noise. Sure, as another review mentioned, my room did overlook a homeless shelter, but it also overlooked many other residential buildings\\u002Fapartments and restaurants - not sure that this should be a deal breaker when selecting a hotel. Very good location for dining and plenty of options in the surrounding area and about a 30 min walk to Toronto harbour and the bottom of the downtown area. \\nOverall, highly recommended and I'd stay here again if in Toronto",
            "We stayed here for our final night in Toronto following a trip to Niagara Falls. We arrived late at night and received an unwelcome reception. The lobby is connected to the restaurant so no privacy or quiet to check in. The female staff was quite unfriendly. We had emailed ahead to request a high floor room but were given one on the 2nd floor. When we entered we realised it was a single king bed rather then the two twins we booked. We returned to reception to explain but the same lady insisted it was our mistake and we had booked incorrectly. When we provided email proof she passed us over to someone else with no apology. The other man was polite and sorted this issue out but we were disappointed with her attitude. The room itself was modern with stylish decor. The room was clean but the bathroom had hairs on the towels and in the sink and chewing gum stuck to the floor. The bed was very comfortable but the room was cold despite the heater and I had to sleep with a jumper on. I expected more given the price and the previous reviews and it certainly was not the high standard hotel we expected. We would not stay again",
            "The Anndore House is a short couple of blocks from the landmark intersection of Yonge and Bloor Streets, and was previously the shabby Comfort Hotel. Hyatt took over the building, hired a decorator who thinks dark brown with black accents is a cheerful colour scheme for hotel rooms, and installed a restaurant and bar in most of the ground floor space. They also doubled the room rates, which still leaves them lower than other midtown hotels. The Anndore seemed clean, staff were helpful when I needed a couple of small things, and somehow, amazingly, the Comfort Hotel room doors that used to close with a jarring crash have been softened somewhat. However, practically everything in the room seemed badly arranged (awkward bathroom, tiny strange light switches, duvet suitable only for short people) and the bar didn\\u2019t seem to be open any time I wanted to make use of it. Your experience may be better, as long as you have the arm strength to open the huge heavy entrance doors. Also, watch out for the little slope in the floor right in front of the elevator",
            "Excellent experience. \\nThe room is clean with a very trendy decor. \\nThe hotel is ideally located (Bloor-Yonge subway station 2 minutes walking or Green P parking on the other side of the street)\\nStaff is providing an excellent service. \\n\\",
            "This hotel is in a great location for exploring downtown Toronto.  \\n\\nThe beds are comfy and the room is nice but the air con is really noisy, and this observation is based on us travelling over the last 3 months and staying in a lot of hotels.\\n\\nThe ladies at reception said that \\u201Csome people were too sensitive\\u201D and that if I turned the air con off at night that might help.  \\n\\nWhen we asked to move rooms their first question was - have you messed up your room?  Not, really customer focussed.  \\n\\nThe second rooms AC was a bit quieter but it is still a really noisy system. \\n\\nIn the second room - which was supposed to be quieter there was a letter from the manager apologising for the construction noise next door and two sets of ear plugs",
            "Looked forward to a nice, upscale hotel,, based on reviews. What we got was a Comfort Inn with a face-lift, without fixing the underlying issues. We stayed in room 205 which when you tried to run the heating didn't work well and was incredibly oisy, or would turn on the A\\u002FC.  They haven't changed the windows just put plantation shutters up to block the drafts.  The toilet role holder is mounted in such a way that you have to be a contortionist to reach it.  Bedding is a quilt with a microfiber quilt cover, and a microfiber blanket...only a bottom sheet, so if you sleep warm good luck, and a very firm mattress.  Good proximity to Yonge which is a blessing, as the hotel has no parking, though a public lot across the street.  So a basic hotel but because it's been given a face-lift they are asking luxury prices, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "Beautiful hotel in a perfect position. Right in the middle of Yonge Street. Lovely large spacious room with large shower room. View from our room was amazing. Hotel was very clean and comfortable. The restaurant in the hotel (Constantines) was very expensive for what it was, especially the drinks, and not enough choice on the menu.This put us off eating there a second time. Hotel staff were accomodating and friendly. Would definitely stay there again",
            "I stayed at Anndore House whilst visiting my family in Toronto. My room was large, but sparse, with a malfunctioning television and toilet. I was advised when I arrived that all hotel amenities were closed due to COVID and nothing was on offer to compensate. Instead of a coffee maker there were instant coffee packets. The nice looking bar was closed and no alcohol was in the room, complimentary\\u002Fcompensatory or otherwise, and the only food on premises was $5 glass jars of gummies. Perhaps at another time this would be a nice place to stay, but compared to other hotels I\\u2019ve stayed at in North America and abroad that I have stayed at during the pandemic, this stay was my worst",

Journey to and from the airport was a breez",

The hotel and rooms were spotless. We loved our room, with 2 queen beds and a seating area. The room also had a fridge which we were able to use. I know it maybe it doesn't go with the look but maybe the room would benefit from curtains, as the white slatted blinds do let a lot of light in when it's daylight outside. The hotel was surprisingly quiet for the location. \\n\\nOne thing I will say is the neighbourhood is questionable. The hotel is located right next to a subway station which is great for getting to Downtown Toronto, however I would not walk around the area of the hotel at night,  especially not alone. We noticed a large number of drug users (openly taking drugs in the surrounding streets), and we went to a play park a  5 minute walk from the hotel where a large number of people were openly taking A Class substances. I would not let this put me off staying at the hotel again, but I guess as with every major city across the world it's important to keep your wits about you, keep valuables close etc. \\n\\nOverall a great stay and I would definitely stay at the hotel again",
            "Such a great location, one of my favourite places to stay in TO. Amazing access to subway too! The area is busy though and the outside noise can be a bit much for some. This last trip, the fire alarm across the street went off for an hour in the middle of the night. The walls could be a little thicker but they do provide ear plugs! The biggest issue that really is just odd, is the entrance, you would never know it\\u2019s there and it\\u2019s a bit sketchy at first, but very cool once you get inside and the real experience is there.",
            "Gem location in the city of Toronto.  Don\\u2019t book rooms next to the elevator rooms #12 on each floor.  Valet parking good but a little concerned that location of keys weren\\u2019t under lock and key and left unattended often.  The east side patio area has leaking natural gas smell from pipes. Waitress was aware of it and didn\\u2019t think it was an issue because it always smells.  We moved seats.",
            "You cant fault the location, and this is why we chose this hotel.  It is in the heart of Toronto, we easy access to shops, cafes and restaurant.  Vibrant, safe area, walking distance from many attractions.\\nThe hotel itself is very nice.  Feels new, definitely modern with a great dining space and bar.  Room had a few issues, maybe it was new that s why?  The room key didnt always work in the lift, or the door.  The light switch frame fell off the wall.  Minor things that take away from the experience though. Service was overall good, reception staff, tentative, most of the times and willing to help.  Customer service style a bit haphazard, or just quite different from what you traditionally anticipate as customer service in a hotel...  For these reasons I think that value for money was not quote there, even though you basically have to pay for being in the center of Toront",
            "An incredible stay, within walking distance of yorkville. The hotel entrance was only accessible my room key after 10:00 which made the hotel feel incredibly safe and the rooms were stunning. Unlike any hotel I\\u2019ve been to before. I would stay there again in a heartbeat",
            "We spent over 3 weeks here in December and early January . The location is excellent , less than a 100 metre from the crossing of Yonge and Bloor There is an excellent restaurant ( Constantine ) and bar in the hotel . The Crow\\u2019s Nest cafe always has really friendly staff and great coffee .\\nIt is excellent for a long term stay even in terms of the layout . You can back and forth to your rooms from the outside without having to cross reception ensuring a greater degree of privacy. \\nThe rooms are fun - I was on the 9 th floor and had a pretty decent view of the downtown buildings. They have quirky things like a record player which is also a blue tooth speaker. \\nThe key factor behind an enjoyable 3 weeks was the staff. Every interaction whether at reception, the bar , the restaurant or the cafe was very friendly and made us feel comfortable and  welcome",
            "I stayed here for business and it is a very nice hotel. Staff were excellent and the location was perfect for me off of Bloor Street. The loft style room was very comfortable and the hotel room was very quiet for sleeping. All and all an excellent value in a great location for me. Very nice",
            "Great stay in Toronto! Unique room accomidations which included vinyl records and record player in room was an awesome touch. Bed and accomidations were comfortable and the location was great. Several restaurants within a short distance",
            "Recently completed a three-night stay at this hotel, and was extremely pleased with the customer service we received as well as the condition of our rooms. There was a bit of a mix-up during our check-in process, in that we had booked a room with two beds, and had been assigned a King room. Staff sorted this out for us very quickly, and we were able to check in after a very long day of travel. The rooms were beautiful, and parking was available directly across the street. The location was very close to two different Subway stations. I has read that the hotel could be noisy, and we had brought a fan to mitigate this, but it was not necessary. Will definitely stay here again when we are next in toronto",
            "Stayed for two nights in the Master Suite. It was the perfect size for me and my partner. Front Desk team was friendly throughout the whole stay. The location is just a block away from Yonge and Bloor, which is a major area for shopping. Did not have a chance to dine at their restaurant (due to COVID restrictions, it closed fairly early), but I am looking to stay again once things open up",
            "I travel to this city quite often and have been in search of a hotel with a convenient location.  On my recent visit I did just that when I happened upon this stylish and trendy looking boutique hotel.  The hotel was within walking distance to everything I needed and everyone I was there to visit.  Very close to subways, restaurants, parking, Yorkville shopping and groceries\\u002Fcafes.  The rooms are very spacious and offer some unique touches not normally found at other hotels.  It is nestled within a neighborhood off the main streets so you feel like you are in a home away from home.  From the walkup to the entry, the Anndore house is very esthetically pleasing. The staff are very attentive and friendly. This just may be my new \\\"go to\\\" for my frequent visits to this city in the future. I am looking forward to experiencing the hotels amenities (restaurants etc.) once the COVID restrictions are lifted.\\",
            "This place is amazing! The style of rooms, the helpful professional staff at check in make this a overall great experience.  Great well lit Public Parking right across the Street. Secure entrance makes you feel safe and in a very nice area of Toronto a minute walk to Bloor St. I keep rebooking and will continue to",
            "We were going to Toronto from UK for a baby shower and also wanted to experience downtown. I booked The Anndore because I wanted to stay with my daughters in the same room, \\u201Cbonding, chat time\\u201D \\u2026 it was amazing , beautifully clean , they delivered bath robes daily when we called housekeeping, without even asking there was a knock at the door which I opened to a lovely young man delivering extra towels. The room has lovely touches like a record player and a choice of 4 albums, we played Harry Belafonte whilst having a drink in the lounge area. Lovely Pluck sleep tea bags were on the tray for a bedtime drink and we are now obsessed with them . Location was phenomenal, Yorkville has really upmarket shops  and restaurants and felt very safe to walk around \\u2026\\nAll round wonderful stay !",
            "I was a bit hesitant about booking The Anndore House, knowing it was once a Comfort Inn \\u2013 a brand and physical older building I wouldn't typically choose. But after reading the reviews and seeing the photos of what Hyatt has done, I decided to give it a shot, and I\\u2019m so glad I did! From the moment I arrived, everything was fantastic. The hotel has a fun vibe\\u2014small, cozy, and boutique without feeling cramped. Check-in was a breeze, and I was pleasantly surprised by the size of my room. It was unexpectedly large, beautifully designed, and incredibly clean\\u2014honestly, one of the cleanest hotel rooms I\\u2019ve stayed in. Everything worked perfectly, and the bed was extremely comfortable.\\n\\nThe location, while a little further north than I needed, was just a quick subway ride away from the main spots. Even as a first-time visitor to Toronto, the TTC was easy to navigate, with the nearest station just a short walk away. The street itself has a few questionable spots, but it\\u2019s clear that the area is evolving, with newer restaurants and stores popping up.\\n\\nI enjoyed the restaurant and its overall vibe, as I ate there for breakfast each morning. The people were great, and breakfast was good, but I had a couple of very minor issues. The buffet selection, while good, was a bit limited. Additionally, the weekend breakfast hours were a bit odd\\u2014brunch started later, so I had to miss the sit-down breakfast altogether as I was heading to the airport. Fortunately, the quick cafe staff were super accommodating and made me a fresh menu item, but I do feel that a consistent breakfast schedule throughout the week would make more sense.\\n\\nAll in all, I couldn\\u2019t have asked for a better stay. I highly recommend The Anndore House and would absolutely stay here again",
            "I recently stayed at the Anndore House with my partner. We absolutely loved our stay. The location is great, right off Yonge Street and close to Yorkville. The room felt personalized and had cute touches. The shower was gorgeous and the bed was comfortable. The rooms have AC units which is nice in the summer. I felt safe staying there because they lock the front doors at night but customers have access with their key cards. Check in and check out were efficient, even with our checkout at four o'clock in the morning. I would absolutely stay here again",
            "Stayed in a King Loft Room. The style of the hotel is really nice - sort of quirky\\u002Findustrial with lots of nice touches in the room including the record player. The room is a pretty good size (used the space well), the 2 armchairs and table were a nice bonus and and bed was big and comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly and the bar area is really nice. \\n\\nThe main let down was the location in terms of it being noisy and a little on the rough side. Its near a main road (Yonge Street) and the windows don't offer much sound proofing. We were also next to the lift which made it noisy. Its also a bit of a walk from the main parts of Toronto. \\n\\nSo overall it was good but think where your room is located is important and important to consider where you want to be near. Our room was on a high floor which was great but west facing which had a city view but also made it noisy",
            "Nice boutique property in Toronto. Overall nice rooms and great location.  Weird that in house restaurant is not part of hotel so therefore no Hyatt Globalist benefit of free breakfast and 500 in lieu of free breakfast never deposited into my account. Had a little excitement when I was there and homeless encampment next door caught on fire. 15 minutes all fires were extinguished and next morning all debris was efficiently removed.\\n\\nMain issue for me is the lack of pillow choice. Should have choice besides high thick foam pillows!!! Was tough to sleep on",
            "The Anndore is in a perfect location for accessing all Toronto's amenities. It's nice to leave the very busy Toronto streets and be enveloped in calm and quiet. The beds were comfortable, the room was clean, bathroom great, and we really appreciated the separate seating area. We also appreciated being able to store our bags. I was eating alone and found the staff in the restaurant very sensitive to making me feel comfortable, as it's not always easy to be by yourself. I would happily stay at Anndore again",
            "The hotel is a nice, botique hotel and the staff were very friendly and open to any questions that were asked.  From food recommendations to things to see or do, the staff were very knowledgeable and made the trip a pleasure.  The hotel itself is north of the lake but well within a Uber\\u002FLyft ride (in winter, walkable in the warmer season) to various destinations down by the lake.   I was pleasently surprised and will definitely stay at this location again the next time I visit Toronto.",
            "Nothing beats coming back to a comfortable bed and relaxing in a space that is more like a city studio apartment (fridge no microwave) than a boring hotel room.  Wished that in-house restaurant Constantine had been open for dinner  during our stay, but finding dining options nearby was never a problem.   Lots of food options to fit most everyone\\u2019s taste and budget within walking distance along Bloor and Yonge.  Just watch your step along Yonge street, Toronto is not immune to the urban homeless problems that plague other cities like SF and NYC. Front desk and housekeeping staff were friendly and great at what they do. Public parking across the street from Anndore was convenient and taking the TTC at Bloor\\u002FYonge station was a breeze because it was so close to the hotel.  Overall, great place to stay",
            "I have stayed in various hotels in Toronto and Anndore has by far the nicest room. The decor is retro + industrial and is exactly like shown on their website (less the flowers).\\nThe staff is friendly and helpful. Special shout out to Augusto at the front desk for the nice warm welcome and helpfulness. It really gave a first awesome impression of the hotel. Room cleaning staff is also very helpful and responsive for missing items from the room.\\nInside the room, spacious walkin closet and sitting area with style. Lots of well-organized cupboards and shelf space throughout the room you can move your own whole bedroom in here.\\nSome people commented on the safety outside of the hotel. It's downtown in a big city and what more needs to be said?\\nAs for other people complaining about the thin walls and noise from other rooms. I also did not find any problem. Yes you can hear some noise from the hallway but it's not different than what I have experienced in other hotels.\\nThere is no gym or swimming pool but I knew it before I booked.\\",
            "Stayed at Anndore House for five days and must say that I'm really satisfied with the hotel and its location midtown Toronto. Close to the vibrant Yonge Street and easy to reach subway or also walking downtown. With to mentioned its close location to the nice area Yorkville. The rooms are relatively large and modern with an industrial design touch, of course this is personal but I liked it",
            "I was hesitant about booking this hotel because I knew so little about it, but the stay was really nice (except for the crappy Satellite TV service during the height of the closing days of the Olympics!!!).  The rooms hve false brick walls with cool artwork, a fake rotary phone and an old-school vinyl record player!  That was a lot of fun to play with and took me back to my childhood.  The hotel is in the Yorkville neighborhood which is near Downtown Toronto as well as a homeless shelter (two doors down to the right -- so go left!).  It's also near a Tim Horton's and two strip clubs, so something for every member of the family!  I never felt unsafe there -- they lock the doors after 10pm, so the strippers don't get in- so don't forget your card key.  If you book on points, choose the valet service -- it's free.  Just give a tip.  Overall, a nice stay and I would reconsider if they FIX THE SATELLITE TV!!!",
            "Very nice boutique Hotel in Downtown Toronto with an industrial design. Staff were very friendly and engaging. All request for items like ice and extra glasses were delivered in a timely manner. Front desk staff and doorman were very nice and helpful",
            "Stayed at the Anndore as Toronto entered stage 3 of COVID-19 restriction-easing. There were no amenities, but the design of the hotel definitely made up for any missing features. Small touches like the early 20th century telephones and brass bathroom and shower taps made our stay very memorable. And the Constantine restaurant upper patio was perfect, with the tree branches and hanging lights creating a cozy ambiance",
            "I had to take a few nights at a hotel in my own city due to an Emergency and was very surprised at how great this hotel is. \\nPros: The service is really above and beyond. Ask for anything and they will provide. The rooms are bigger than expected though the decor is unusual. No carpeted floors in the rooms which I love. Detachable shower heads were a plus. Two single seater couches in front of the TV for a King bed room in a hotel in downtown Toronto for about 300 a night? Wow.\\nCons: Very noisy. No soundproofing and other guests were loud on my floor. And the construction noise really vibrates throughout the room and you FEEL it. The AC is on the louder side so be ware though I didn't mind since I'm used to a loud AC. I didn't sleep the first night due to the noise outside the window. But oh well. I still gave it a 5 star because of how great the staff was. Really made me feel better at a time when I wasn't feeling great.\\",
            "My recent stay at The Anndore House in Toronto was a perfect blend of contemporary chic and urban comfort. The hotel\\u2019s location in the trendy Yorkville neighborhood provided a stylish retreat while being within walking distance of Toronto\\u2019s cultural attractions. My room was a haven of modern elegance, with sleek design and all the amenities I needed. The central location allowed me to explore Toronto\\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods, from Yorkville to Kensington Market. Dining at the hotel\\u2019s restaurant, Constantine, was a culinary adventure, with a menu that celebrated global flavors and creative dishes. The Anndore House exceeded all my expectations, and I eagerly look forward to my next visit to this stylish gem in Toronto",
            "Tucked away a block from Yonge\\u002FBloor is a boutique hotel that has surprises at every turn. The online photos are very reflective of what you get, both from the rooms and the rest of the hotel. Very impressed by internal security and safe vibe. The bed was super-comfy and the shampoo\\u002Fconditioner\\u002Fbody wash smelled great. Oh, and as a bonus, you could turn the bathroom light on from your bedside, and turn on\\u002Foff all the individual lights in the room from your bedside",
            "Location is ideal for touring Toronto. Clean, unique, pleasant decor in our room.  We slept very well in the comfy bed and as far as the windows go, if you open the wooden shutters there are blackout roll down blinds.  Very modern conveniences in the room.    Staff are friendly. Get a Citypass. Visit Casa Loma. Take the subway. Only one block away.   This hotel was a great decision for us!   And the dining room is divine. Constantine's is an amazing experience.  Three nights stay on the top floor of an exceptional boutique hotel. You will not be disappointed.  Thank for helping my daughter and I make memories.",
            "A chic boutique hotel located in downtown Toronto.  The room got this retro feeling to it. love the little details and how they spend the time to decorate the room with a vinyl player but sadly, the vinyl records are all scratched up so you can't really enjoy it.  Overall a decent stay while parking across the street is abit pricey",
            "This hotel is located only a few minutes walk from the intersection of Toronto\\u2019s two main subway lines. There are lots of amenities in the area even if the local streetscape is a bit sketchy. The room was roomy and very tastefully decorated with a very urban feel. Lots of closet room. Large bathroom with fantastic waterfall shower. Building is quiet. The food area downstairs is really well appointed although I don\\u2019t get a chance to eat there during my stay. Staff were very pleasant and efficient.",
            "Many hotels in downtown Toronto resemble each other.  I was looking for a funkier place.  I certainly got that at the Anndore House.  Staff was welcoming.  Bar area is comfortable and one can also have access to full restaurant menu there.  Menu was lovely as were the drinks choices.  Room are fun to look at and practical as well.  Decoration and style is interesting.  Well situated also",
            "This hotel is truly a hidden gem in the middle of bustling downtown Toronto. The rooms are beautifully decorated with thoughtful details, and it was surprisingly family friendly (travelled with a 2.5 year old and she loved it!) Central location close to all the major transit lines, but the hotel itself felt like a cozy oasis away from the buzz of the city. I'd stay here 100 times over"

Needless to say I was a little apprehensive about it as I had booked it only because I needed a place to stay and didn't have another option at the time. But I was pleasantly surprised. They let me check in late, my room was on the 4th floor, and big enough with an excellent view over the parking lot and Markham Road and the 401. In spite of its close proximity to these, I was not troubled by any noise. There was a microwave and fridge in the room which again was necessary for me, and the breakfast was absolutely amazing with every single option available that one could possibly think of. The only thing I would suggest improving is the breakfast seating area, as there wasn't much space. For me it was fine as I was by myself, but some couples and families had a problem finding seats to sit together. There is a gym and swimming pool but I didn't use them. Front desk is very very helpful. My booking was for two separate rooms as I couldn't get the same room for three nights but they changed it for me so I stayed in the same room. They also allowed me to check out late. \\n\\nEven though my first time staying here was because I didn't have a choice, I shall definitely stay here again, this time by choice, and I'll make sure I book well in advance to get a good rate.",

The couch was comfy for lounging, eating and watching TV.\\nNow the peice de resistance; the bed! \\nI lasted only about ten mins watching TV before I drifted off into the most wonderful sleep I've had in a very long time. We woke up refreshed and ready to start our day with smiles on our faces. Cheesy I know... \\nTotally recommend this hotel and to think I didn't even check the amenities. \\nWill stay here again",
            "I booked 3 rooms for our group, we were staying there so we could enjoy the city and the zoo.\\n\\nUpon arrival everything seemed fine, we were checked in by Mohammed, who was very friendly and fast.\\n\\nWe got to our rooms, they appeared upon first glance to be fine.\\n\\nThe one room had hairs in the bed, to the point that my Mother refused to sleep in it, and stripped the bed to sleep on some blankets from in our car.\\n\\nThe second room was fine.\\n\\nThe third room, our room, was fine until we got our kids dressed for bed and pulled out the sofa queen bed. Upon opening it it was absolutely obvious that it had never been made, I don't mean that there were not blankets, I mean that it had blankets that had quite obviously been slept it, including hair and sweat stains on the blankets, it also had a vape in the blankets.\\n\\nWe called down and spoke with Mohammed who didn't really understand the issue, so we had him come up to the room and look, he offered to give us clean blankets so that we could change the bed, but we refused and our children were not interested in sleeping in the bed after seeing the state of it and the vape. He took photos to forward to his Manager and we requested to change rooms. He was apologetic and went downstairs to try and find us another room, he had us meet him on a lower floor that had some sort of party going on and was now a floor away from the rest of our family group. Finally, he found another room on the same floor for us, and dressing in pajamas, we had to pack up all our belongings, move to a new room, unpack, then finally go to bed.\\n\\nWhen we checked out, they acted like nothing had happened, and we asked to speak with the Manager, who was not in. So we spoke with the Supervisor who offered us $2 in reward points, and gave us a 6% discount... She told us that it was all she could do and we would hear from the Manager. We are at a week now and we've heard nothing from the Manager.\\n\\nIn addition, none of the ice machines worked, and none of the vending machines worked. The breakfast in a morning was limited due to COVID restrictions, as was pool use, which is understandable, but their breakfast \\\"sausage\\\" was chopped up hotdogs, and anything other than cereal in a ziplock bag or eggs was hidden around a corner that you had to ask for, but it wasn't even possible to see it in order to ask for it.\\n\\nWe are extremely unsatisfied with our experience and the customer service, apart from Mohammed who initially check us",
            "This place is a fav of our family in scarborough.  It is clean, well appointed, and in a relatively safe area.  the pool and hot tub are nice but the pool was abnormaly hot this time around.  Breakfast was very good and varies slightly day to day.  sometimes the A\\u002FC unit stops working but you just need to reset the circuit breaker on the end of the power cord.\\n\\nI will also note that our king bed was extremely nice but the sofabed was the opposite.\\n\\nMy one complaint is that they confused me with another patron and ended up cancelling my reservation.  I am thankful at least to have a room as they were fully booked on the second day.  It was a pain having to check in and out again the second day and now im looking out for billing anomalies on my credit card.  just a hassle.  Was told it was a \\\"glitch\\\" but i suspect an error by a new employee checking me in who didnt seem to notice that two people can share the same last name",
            "Was close to many things and easy access to main roads. Room was well appointed for the large family group. The breakfast had a great variety and lots of food. 24hr access to the coffee machine was nice too due to the small keurig in the room being a bit awkwar",
            "Exceptional customer service in all aspects of accommodations.  The staff at the front desk, the breakfast servers and the cleaning staff were always friendly, helpful and so professional.  The location of the hotel was superb with eating places close and yet nestled in a good location.  I would highly recomend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in a wonderful environment while away from home",
            "Our usual accommodation with family was not available and this was an excellent stay for one night.  More expensive than we're used to for a non-vacation convenience stay but it seems all of the hotel prices have increased significantly since the pandemic.  This was a reasonable rate compared to competitors and included parking, wifi, an excellent breakfast and convenient access near the highway and commercial hub of Scarborough",
            "Positives\\nCheck in and check out was easy.\\nBreakfast was amazing!!! Far exceeded my expectations.\\nPool area was great for the kids.\\nLocation is very convenient for restaurants and shopping.\\nI wish I would have got the name of the young lady at the front desk because she was lovely. \\n\\nNegatives\\nDirty sheets left on pull out couch from previous booking. Only given one flat sheet, blanket and two pillow cases(with no pillows??)to change.\\nLipstick mouth on the decorative bed pillow\\nBroken fridge. Would not cool even when I turned it up. \\nPrevious booking spilled something down the side of the desk which had not been cleaned so it was dried and crusted down the side.\\nCalled down before going to the pool to make sure they had pool towels which they assured me they did. Got to the pool. No towels. Requested towels. Employee only brought enough for my group despite seeing that there were other people in the pool that would need towels. \\n\\nOverall, I only rated this hotel a 3 because of its cleanliness issues. I would recommend this hotel but only because I'm hopeful the cleaning issues were a one off. \\n\\",

            "We arrived at 11:20pm after a very long hot day in Toronto on a family vacation where we went to Ripleys aquarium and a Toronto blue jays game.\\n\\nIt was heavy traffic after the ball game so we arrived late to the hotel ready for a good night sleep before our next day of planned vacation where we where going to go to the Toronto zoo.\\n\\nWhen we arrived at the hotel they informed us that they had CANCELLED our booking because they called us at 10:40pm and we did not answer. I had my phone with me but probably because of the heavy traffic in Toronto it did not ring or I did not hear it and was also driving.\\n\\nI was there with my three children and NO place to sleep.\\n\\nThey were rude and showed NO empathy for my situation.\\n\\nThey did not offer me any other room as they claimed they were full and did not help me find another hotel or anything!!!!!\\n\\nI drove to a few local hotels close by, and all of them were closed to the public, and at full capacity. (I can not claim this but they looked to be used for refugees?)\\n\\nI proceeded to sit in a parking lot and called over a dozen hotels and all were full.\\n\\nWe had to end our vacation and drive all the way home - arriving home after 3am in the morning.\\n\\nI was SO SO very upset with the lack of service provided by this hotel and will NEVER book here again and would never recommend it to anyone",
            "Good service and the room was clean. Good place to stay for single or family occupancy. I would recommend this hotel to others. Receptionists were very helpful, including duty manager. Breakfast was okay, cannot complain. But the room and the bathroom were clean.",
            "Perfect! I give A+ to the charming and kindness people at the front desk specialy 3 employees the morning \\uD83C\\uDF1E breakfast was delicious and the bed was very confortable. We had a good time at the pool. The room was really clean. My family and me keep wonderful memories",
            "The hotel and room were lovely and breakfast was a great spread (despite lukewarm to cold). The big downfall was the cost, this hotel should not be 300+\\u002Fnight at any time!!! Location was not convenient, driving required for dinner unless subs or Keg (not exactly family friendly)",
            "I stayed at this hotel in July with my family and had to extend our stay which went smoothly with a good price considering the fact that no reservation was made earlier Being a member helped me to get a good price though",
            "My family and I stayed here and we all enjoyed it, especially the free breakfast which  seemed to be quite popular. The room was nice and clean and the staff friendly and accommodating. This  was our second stay here in three months and plan on staying there on future trips when we visit",
            "Easy check in with pleasant staff who helped me find my membership number. Hotel has updated appearance, front lobby is nice.  Room was comfortable and clean.  Bed comfortable. AC works so well that I found myself a bit cold overnight and couldn't find any additional blankets to use. Soaps\\u002Fshampoos in bathroom nice quality. Working fridge in room was helpful to have. Easy access off the 401, was perfect for us....and was not too far from downtown Toronto.  \\nBreakfast was plentiful, lots of choice, good quality for hotel breakfast.\\nSatisfied with the stay and would stay again",
            "We went to the Toronto Zoo and stayed at this hotel after a long day of walking. The staff were wonderfully friendly and the rooms comfortable.\\nBut the best part was that my son forgot his backpack in the lobby. The staff kept it safe for several days. We got it back with all belongings  after a quick phonecall. I was very impressed",
            "Check in was fast and easy but couldn't pre-register. Requested additional pillows\\u002Ftowels through the online form but that didn't work. Hot and cold breakfast was available and decent but wedges were a bit tough. Went to the aquarium and zoo and the Subway being so close made getting downtown Toronto a breeze while the hotel is only about 10m from the Zoo. Not a fancy hotel by any means but had everything we needed to for a nights sleep. Choose a Wed night stay as the cost was the cheapest regardless of hotel. Didn't get to the pool but it was open and would have been a great way for the kids to kill some time if needed. We like a medium firmness bed and we found it was a bit soft for our liking so if you like a really firm bed then this may not be the best place to stay",
            "This was the only hotel available that was in close proximity to the event we were attending. We were pleasantly surprised. Clean room, good bathroom products.\\nPleasant staff, and a fairly decent breakfast included with room cost. By no means a high end hotel. However, totally adequate for a one night stay. No bar, or restaurant, which in our case was not required. We did not use the Pool or fitness centre. However, would have if time had permitted, they both looked totally fine. We are quite particular, and would have no problem staying here again",
            "Nice hotel, clean, great breakfast, friendly staff. Enjoyed 3 nights there for our girls hockey tournament and won a Gold medal! Staff was very tolerant too, having a big team there.  Many hotels aren\\u2019t. Rooms were a bit warm but thankfully the thermostat was easy to use. Only complaint...  please don\\u2019t rudely call at 11:18am, tell us checkout is 11 and ask if we\\u2019re paying the  $75 late checkout fee, as we\\u2019re walking out the door.",
            "My wife and I chose this hotel to stay at as it was partnered with the Ontario Science Centre.  We brought our grandson here for the weekend.  We received a twenty per cent discount at the Science Centre, showing our hotel reservation at the entrance.  The location was great as it was very close to Hwy 401 and easy to get there.  It is only fifteen minutes from the Science Centre and close to restaurants, although if you drive twenty minutes to Yonge Street you will find endless selections of restaurants!  The hotel was very clean, the staff were extremely friendly, the pool was very clean, and the hot buffet breakfast was incredibly good!!  The hotel also has available a level two charger which we used for our EV.  Upon departure on Sunday morning, the desk clerk gave our grandson a few treats - that made him even more happy.  It was a great over-all experience and would highly recommend this hotel",

            "I organized a company holiday dinner at the 1 Hotel in the Chestnut ballroom and then up for drinks to Harriet's. The hotel is stunning, it's like walking into an oasis in the city, very unique and no detail overlooked. The food for dinner was incredible, the 360 view of the city on the terrace was unbeatable but what made the whole night was how attentive, warm and professional the staff were. Ryan the banquet manager and his whole team where just the most pleasant to work with and everyone at the dinner noticed, commented and were grateful for the enhanced experience.\\nWe will definitely be coming back for future events! \\nWell done 1 Hotel!\\nNadia T\\nWildcard Experienc",
            "I stayed at the 1 hotel in March for the night before and after my wedding. \\nMy room was gorgeous, spacious, clean and had a fully equipped kitchen which was really handy.  People say you don't sleep well the night before your wedding, I slept like a baby. The bed was so comfortable and luxurious. \\n\\nService -  The service at 1 hotel has been nothing short of incredible.  When walking into the hotel you are always greeted in a very friendly manner and they make sure you know that if there is anything you need, it is available to you if you just ask. They provided us a phone number to text them if there was anything we needed to our room and we always received prompt responses and they were always helpful.  \\n\\nFood -  THE FOOD.  When planning our wedding we had several meetings at the hotel.  The food at 1kitchen is always fantastic. The burger... wow!!  Again, all the staff are so friendly and want to ensure your experience is great.  The lobby bar makes a fantastic espresso martini for my martini lovers, and has a really great vibe in the evenings.  I couldn't believe how busy it was on a Saturday night!  The rooftop restaurant is not only beautiful, but also has fantastic food and drinks. \\n\\nOverall - great hotel, great rooms, fantastic staff and I cannot wait to go back time and time again.  I have already recommended the hotel and the restaurants in the hotel to so many people",
            "Our connecting flight from Toronto to NYC was canceled and we were stranded for a few days. We arrived exhausted and miserable about our plight, but all that turned around within minutes of walking into this hotel. We\\u2019re checking out two days later and are almost sad to leave. \\n\\nThe staff are welcoming and highly attentive, the hotel room is beautiful and well designed, and the hotel bars and restaurants are terrific (though not cheap). The entire hotel is an aesthetic delight!There is a heavy focus on environmental sustainability, from using only recycled wood throughout the building to providing a lobby fruit stand containing less than perfect but perfectly edible fruit that would otherwise have been discarded at grocery stores. We did not use the gym or pool but we were told the gym includes Peloton bikes. Judging from the rest of the place, I\\u2019m sure both are gorgeous. Our studio room with a king size bed is spacious, very clean and bright, and well appointed with a Nespresso maker, tea, filtered tap water and snack bar. The bathroom is gorgeous and has a rainfall shower head and the shower gel, shampoo and conditioner smell heavenly. Even the hair dryer is much better than average.\\n\\nThe hotel is located in the fashion district, and although there is a lot of construction going on, it offers some nice dining options within walking distance. The hotel\\u2019s restaurants (including rooftop restaurant) are popular with non-guests of the hotel, so that tells you something. Plus, the hotel offers free Tesla rides within a 4 km radius, which gets you to several key areas such as downtown. \\n\\nIn short, we love this place and we hope to have an opportunity to come back. In fact, we already asked if we can come back if our flight tonight is canceled. Again",

The lobby had all kinds of great spaces to meet and connect with our group.  We used the lobby to do an impromptu meeting space. Our rooms opened out to a common space on the 3rd floor - it was beautiful weather so we also sat outside for one of our meetings.  All in all, the staff were welcoming and friendly.  Would recommend the accommodations as well as Casa Madera.",

My second stay, first was for business and second now for fun, I have to say I could tell the difference in how they personalize your stay. The Front Office Manager reached out to see if anything could do done to make this stay better so I was able to tell her about my wife joining. We were given a nice upgrade, a great return welcome and even the fine individuals in room service knew I was a repeat guest. I've been recognize before as a repeat traveller but this folks made it feel like home. You will know when you stay how you make a difference.\\nPros: The Staff, The Cleanliness the room, the location to queen st w, great texting service, sustainable impact\\nCons: Can be loud at night, doesn't bother me but woke up wife up a few times\\nTip: Harriets (rooftop) is not managed but the hotel but the Front Desk will try to get you in if you are a guest of the hotel.

            "My wife and I booked three nights at 1 Hotel Toronto in early June for a last-minute mini-moon after our original honeymoon plans were derailed by a tropical storm. We picked 1 Hotel because we wanted to treat ourselves and we were intrigued by the rooftop pool (more on that later). \\n\\nBecause TO wasn't originally in the plan, my wife was a bit bummed. We had envisioned relaxing by the ocean with cocktails, not exploring a new city. I reached out to 1 Hotel to see if I could set up something special for her. Alisha from the Concierge responded quickly to my email and helped me coordinate a surprise, custom bouquet of my wife's favorite flowers to be in our room upon arrival. When we got to the room, we realized she also sent complimentary sparkling wine and truffles (thank you, Alisha!!!). This was such a sweet way to welcome us and definitely set the tone for our stay.\\n\\nThe hotel is beautiful and clearly well thought out. Every staff member we interacted with was attentive and helpful. The driver (whose name I'm forgetting!) was particularly great and it was so useful to have access to a car to take us around town from the hotel. \\n\\nThe only reason I'm giving this hotel four stars instead of five is that on two of the three nights we were there the pool was closed for private events. We booked this hotel in part because we wanted to lounge on the rooftop pool and enjoy Harriette's, the bar up there. Yet because of weather,  the only two times we could've used it, we did not have access to it. It would be helpful if the hotel alerted guests proactively to private events that limit access to the amenities we're paying for",
            "This hotel was genuinely so amazing from the second you walked through the doors into the lobby.  Every part of the decor was so thoughtfully placed, and the focus on sustainability and bringing new life to otherwise scrapped materials was so great to see in a hotel.  The service was very efficient and easy to contact, as you could through texting the front desk, and not to mention incredibly kind and thoughtful. The room was so beautiful and felt really homey, and was a great way to spend a couple days away for an anniversary. Oh, and the food was really great. I still think about that avocado toast more often then I'd like to admit. Thank you for such a great experience 1 Hotel, looking forward to my next stay",
            "We stayed at the 1Hotel last weekend (two rooms for two nights each). \\n\\nI'm not exactly sure how to rate our stay because lots of things went wrong, but the hotel also tried to make up for their missteps.\\n\\nLet's start with the good: this hotel is beautiful, landscaping is lovely, service is friendly, location is great, rooms are clean, and the gym is nice.\\n\\nNow the not-so-great: our room was double booked which we learned when someone with a key walked in on us, there was a $29 destination fee per room, per night (which nobody disclosed to us upon check in), one our rooms had frosted glass which was odd and meant that we couldn't see outside unless we craned our necks. \\n\\nAdditionally, everything we ate at the hotel was average at best Example: the avocado toast had some kind of premade spread instead of fresh avocado which wasn't tasty at all. \\n\\nIt goes without saying that this hotel is expensive so I had high hopes!\\n\\nLike I said, the hotel tried to make up for things by offering food and beverage credits (which we declined because we already had so many through the Amex FHR program). \\n\\nUltimately, they credited us the destination fees though, offered us another night on the house, and by their own volition credited one night back on one of the rooms. So 5 stars for their customer service!\\n\\nI'll likely give the hotel another try on my next trip...maybe we just came on an off weekend",
            "I was visiting Toronto with my 10 yo son to see the Hockey Hall of Fame and a Leafs game. The staff was amazing from the moment we arrived. I booked through Amex Travel which I often do and this was the first time a hotel has ever acknowledged the upgrades etc that may be associated with the booking without me having to ask! \\n\\nOur room was located on the third floor directly across from the elevator. I immediately knew this was going to be a problem but decided not to ask for a switch. It was very loud throughout the night. Before breakfast the next day I spoke with Adam at the front desk and he was wonderful, we were given a choice of two other rooms which were lovely. Adam was super helpful with directions, arranging cars etc.\\n\\nThe property itself is beautiful, there is a lot of construction near by (and throughout the city). The elevators were a problem when I was there. It seems they share the two elevators with a condo building so they are very crowded and slow. They are even slower in the evening because of the rooftop bar. One of them broke on Saturday night, I had come down to the lobby to grab a drink to bring back to my room and got stuck waiting. The front desk attendant knew that my son was waiting upstairs and escorted me to the service elevator so that I would not have to wait any longer. \\n\\nRoom service and restaurant were also great",
            "We stayed at 1 Hotel about a month ago, celebrating a special occasion, and from the moment I spoke with Chef Derek Powers and let him know, him and his team were BEYOND accommodating. I have some dietary limitations, and he went out of his way to select items I could eat, that were all DELICIOUS. We ate at the hotel a few times during our stay, and I was so impressed by the quality of the food and service - everything was fresh and I felt good about what I was eating. We saw Chef Powers a few more times during our stay and he really went out of his way to celebrate our special weekend, and was happy to offer us recommendations that suited our dietary needs. The room was also GORGEOUS... it felt new and clean and was incredibly comfortable. I also love the focus on sustainability. I really couldn't say anything but great things about our stay. Thank you Chef Powers and the 1 Hotel team for making our weekend one to remember",
            "I had the good fortune of hosting a bachelorette at 1 Hotel last month and can't say enough good things about our experience! Immediately after we had booked our stay, I was contacted by our host, Brooklyn, who was incredibly personable, enthusiastic, professional and welcoming! Brooklyn went above and beyond to make our stay great, and went the extra mile by way of offering helpful tips on places to go and things to see. The rooms are beautiful, and the beds are so so comfortable. The location is excellent for a night on the town, steps away from some of the best restaurants and bars in the city. I hope to be back soon",
            "The venue was beautiful. I was a big fan of 1 Hotels. Unfortunately this place fell a bit short. There were a few issues that prevented the stay from being worth the amount spent to stay here. First we had a toilet issue all weekend. The water ran in the toilet all day and night making it hard to sleep. Staff tried multiple times to fix it but ultimately it was unsuccessful. I would have preferred they offer to move me to another room. And secondly, the hotel is rather loud. It seems this place is more for a party rather than luxury. We could hear lots of people on our floor until very late at night being loud. Also, the competition for the elevator at most times in the evening was a bit disappointing. You have to line up with party people trying to go to the rooftop to get in the elevator to go to your room. Besides all of that, the hotel is very stunning as you walk in, very impressive. Unfortunately though, this doesn\\u2019t feel like a 5 star resort. It\\u2019s more like an elevated 4 star hotel. In all fairness, the staff were very attentive and friendly",
            "We really enjoyed our friends trip to Toronto, and had an excellent time staying at the The One Hotel. The property was very clean, filled with light and I appreciated the additional attention to sustainability.

            "Very accommodating on my adjusted arrival and departure times. The woody, clean, and sustainable design of my room made feel very comfortable. \\n\\nA few cool small things that are unique: I liked their \\u201Cdo not disturb\\u201D sign being made of a rock; they also have a wood tab that lets you leave things behind for donation in case you brought too many things. \\n\\nRooftop pool was very inviting with towel service and drinks. \\",

The room was so beautiful and the food in 1kitchen.. WOW... speechless. It was so fresh and flavourful, they had healthy options too which is sometimes hard to find in hotels.

            "We chose 1Hotel for our stay because we had stayed there a few times before. The rooms are consistently clean, beautiful, cozy. \\n\\nAs we we left our room, a few members of the housekeeping team were outside and one of them (Martha) stopped us ans asked me how to pronounce my name, I told her and she said she was assigned to clean my room during my stay, she asked if I had any preferences or needed any additional items in my room. She was so pleasant and each time we ran into her she'd greet us by our names. She always refreshed the room quite a few times without prompting so each time we entered it seemed like we were arriving for the first time. It was definitely above and beyond service. \\n\\nI downloaded the app on my last stay and added preferences and noticed that on this visit there were a few added special features like a fruit platter and a nice note on our desk when we returned to the room that was personalized to me.\\n\\nWe also had friends stay and worked with Melida, Director Front Desk, to have each guest accommodated. Two guests decided to join last minute and she made arrangements for them the day before, honouring our rate and even getting the rooms on the same floor (two of them.were right beside us). \\n\\nOverall our stay with respect to rooms and booking was fantastic",
            "We had a spacious studio suite on the 9th floor. Initial concerns over noise from construction across the street turned out to be unwarranted.  Highlights of our stay: the hotel restaurant was superb!!  A polished hand in the kitchen that was  on par with a fine dining establishment. \\n\\nFriendly staff  both in the hotel and the restaurant and not a whiff of attitude. Location was close to Farm Boy which meant easy access to breakfast and lunch goodies bought in advance and enjoyed later without having to leave the room.  Thor coffee on the next block was a jewel.  The bedding and the beds were fantastic. And the filtered tap water was great. \\n\\nThe only downside was the bar scene along King Street a couple of blacks away, that was noisy and crowded, not conducive to a relaxing evening strol",
            "I was wondering if this location would live up to the Miami location and it definitely does. I am an avid traveler and a foodie, the 1 Hotel is definitely right up my alley. My girlfriend and I came to Toronto for a weekend getaway and I am SO happy we chose this spot.\\n\\nEvery single staff member, from the front desk, to the bartenders, to the pool service, to the housekeepers, EVERYONE was genuinely happy, attentive and so friendly. Making us feel right at home. \\n\\nThe food at the restaurants is absolutely delicious. Try the Bento Box up at the pool, it was the perfect lunch. Also stopped into the 1 Kitchen for a drink before dinner. The spicy marg was perfectly concocted. \\n\\nWe treated ourselves to a suite with a bathtub and it was SOOO relaxing. The perfect way to unwind after a long day. The gym was also very impressive. Literally every piece of equipment you could ever ask for. I don't usually hit the gym when I'm on vacation but I couldn't resist with the selection of clean and unique machines. \\n\\nThe decor of the entire hotel has always been very inspiring to me over the years. We have begun to recycle more and introduce more nature into our apartment after our visits at the various 1 Hotel locations. \\n\\nWhoever oversees this or manages the 1... PLEASE keep doing what you are doing with these hotels. \\nI look forward to seeing you again soon. \\n\\nSkyler",
            "Our 1 Hotel stay was exceptional!  We would like to thank Steven Dagenais who helped us get discounted corporate rates. He provided outstanding service and ensured that we were happy with all aspects of our visit!  Also, we had great assistance from Stephanie with finalizing the booking and she addressed any questions we had along the way. \\n\\nWe experienced 1 Kitchen for brunch and dinner, Flora Lounge for cocktails, Harriet's Rooftop for dinner and we also utilized room service for a meal!  The food and drinks are so fresh and delicious. We just loved all of it.\\n\\nThe rooms are so clean, unique and beautiful.  Sustainability was designed in everything from beautiful furniture, live plants everywhere and even the small items in each room.  \\n\\nThanks again to Steven, Stephanie and every single team member who were attentive, pleasant, happy and extremely quick to address all our requests!!",
            "We stayed for a long weekend and enjoyed the many amenities.  Fruit infused water in the lobby most days and filtered water in the sinks\\u002Fshowers is a very nice touch during the summer.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The building can become crowded as there are long-term rentals, a business operating out of the penthouse, a restaurant and small pool area on the roof and only 2 elevators servicing the 15-20 floors (including subterranean",
            "Lovely hotel in a great location. The bed was very comfortable and the stuff quite friendly. Attached to the hotel are some great restaurants, so traveling far for good food isn\\u2019t necessary. It was nice they included a Bluetooth speaker in the room so we could play some white noise at night. Hallway noise could be a little distracting for some. Valet was very helpful and the lobby a great place to hang out for live music and drinks in the evening",
            "When ever I travel to Toronto I typically stay at the Hazelton or the Fairmont but I decided I wanted to try something new and stay at the 1 Hotel.. and let me tell you I was not disappointed. I was blown away not only by how luxurious this eco friendly hotel is but also the exceptional service I received. I dined at Harriet's and Casa Madera and had some of the best dining experiences that I can remember. The guests service manager Kristy gave me her personal contact information and was so attentive to all of my needs. If you're looking for luxury, comfort, good food, incredible atmosphere, and phenomenal services this is the spot for you",
            "I really enjoyed my stay, especially the perks like the complimentary tesla car service provided by Evolve Limousine & Rentals for guests, this service alone is great value and would certainly secure a future stay just for the added benefit of getting around the city (big thanks to Richard and Anthony).  I appreciate the small details ex. rock to show \\\"do not disturb \\\" and the berry water in the lobby, also love the text concierge service.  The espresso martinis from the lobby bar are delicious, special thanks to Beth for the quality service and DJ Kori Hall for a great Saturday night. The only constructive criticism I have is the rooftop pool - operations seems a bit unorganized, and guests of the hotel aren't necessarily prioritized over random walk-ins for the limited seating available. It was difficult to order a drink by the pool and I had to seek out a server several times for water, drink order and seating on the pool chairs. The service was excellent once I found a server and pool attendee (they were kind, polite and tried their best), but I felt like they were overwhelmed or lacked proper support\\u002Fdirection.  Would certainly recommend for single, female travellers, I felt safe and had a positive experience",
            "Everything was amazing.  This hotel really focuses on the little things.   For example, there was a yoga mat in the room and after the turn down service there was a robe laid out on my bed and a personalized \\u201CGood evening\\u201D note on the nightstand.  The staff are the friendliest I have ever seen.  Add in the incredible ambiance of this quaint little gem and you have a near perfect stay.  I couldn\\u2019t have been more delighted",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at 1 Hotel Toronto. It\\u2019s location to the water, Queen street shopping and the Stackt market was convenient. The hotel lobby and my room offered a breath of fresh air from the noise and the busyness of the city. I was warmly welcomed by several of the staff. After a long period of travel that left me dehydrated and hungry, there was fresh fruit and flavored water to enjoy while I checked in. My room was an oasis of calm. Though I was street side, the noise didn\\u2019t penetrate the space and the interior design of the room made up for the lack of a view. Everything that the hotel offered that I took advantage of was a positive experience. I borrowed a bike and the concierge provided me with a safe and easy path to the bike path that runs along the water. After a long day, I decided to order room service for dinner. There were several excellent vegan, healthy options. The carrot soup was amazing. It was delivered by an extremely friendly staff person and in a timely manner. My room was equipped with a bathtub. The hotel provided bath salts so I decided to end the evening with a bath. It was a very calm environment and perfect way to end a busy day. The bathroom has everything anyone could need. The toiletries they provide are high quality and smell amazing. The hair dryer was also of high quality. It was a Dyson. I usually travel with my own hairdryer when I check luggage because the hotel hair dryers usually fry my hair. I recently stayed at a Ritz Carlton property assuming they would have a really good dryer but they surprisingly had a super cheap one that made my hair frizzy for the whole trip. Since I was only doing a carry-on, I left my hair dryer at home and was so excited to see that the 1 Hotel stocks their rooms with such a nice hair dryer. . Never underestimate the importance of these small details. The other cool feature of this hotel is that they have Tesla house cars that can take you places in the city within a certain radius. Even though I didn\\u2019t take advantage of this, it was nice to know that it was an option.",
            "Not only is 1 Hotel beautiful, but the service is top notch. We used a third party site to book our room two weeks prior, and when we arrived to check-in, the hotel hadn\\u2019t received our reservation (fault of the third party site; not 1 Hotel.) By the day of check-in, the room rates had gone up. 1 Hotel matched the original rate and upgraded our room.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nWe were here to celebrate my husbands birthday, so they sent a complementary macaroon and fruit tray up to the room as soon we arrived, with a personal note wishing him a happy birthday. A small gesture that was greatly appreciated.\\n\\nWe went out for a couple hours, and when we returned, our room had been tidied up; bed remade, dirty towels removed and replaced, anything we had used in the room was restocked, the garbage cans were emptied, and all of our personal belongings were neatly organized.\\n\\nMost of all, I specifically want to thank Samantha G. for truly going above and beyond in helping us navigate our reservation not being received, for matching the original rate that we booked at, for upgrading our room, and for the note with the macarons and fruit. She was able to smooth out a bumpy start to our getaway, and make it extra special. \\n\\nAll in all, our stay was fantastic. We will be returning in the future, and I would highly recommend 1 Hotel to anyone",
            "The hotel promotes itself as a luxury hotel but the service is poor and it\\u2019s amenities are lacking.  If you ask about the hotels amenities, menus or services most staff won\\u2019t know the answer or worse, will simply make up an answer.  When asked if a house car was available and we were told that they didn\\u2019t know when it would be available or if it would be available.   As we walked out the door there were two house cars out front (30 steps from the person who had no idea when they would be available) that were empty and waiting to take guests wherever they needed to go.  \\n\\nThe hotel itself is beautiful and tastefully decorated but staying there is like giving the keys of a Ferrari to a someone learning to drive.   They don\\u2019t appreciate what they have, they have no idea how to use it, and so they can\\u2019t help others to enjoy it.  \\n\\nThe hotel was opened in August 2021 and promotes sustainability.  They even use Teslas as their house cars.   One small problem with this is that if you actually drive a Tesla (or any EV) you can\\u2019t actually charge it at this hotel.   Most luxury (and even standard) hotels have at least a few electric chargers at this point as automakers roll out more electric cars but this \\u201Ceco\\u002Fsustainable\\u201D hotel has exactly zero chargers.  It\\u2019s actually shocking (no pun intended). \\n\\nThe night life in the main lobby and roof was lively and had a \\u201Cclub\\u201D feel but if you want to experience real luxury and the service that comes from staying in a luxury hotel you may want to try the Ritz, Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, or one of the many other fine hotels in Toronto.  We wanted to give this one a try as we liked the whole sustainability concept but the service was a real let down and we won\\u2019t be back",
            "i was recommended to this hotel by a colleague who had stayed here previously.\\nmy wife and I were not disappointed. we are very environmentally conscious and everything this hotel stands for aligns with us and our views, which made the choice in booking here a non-given. we were not able to go up to Harriet's but enjoyed a few great cocktails at Flora lounge before heading out for dinner. there had been a couple of issues with my booking but Samantha at the front desk was very quick to assist us. she was polite and professional and was attentive to our needs. she also gave us some suggestions of things to do around the city and we had a great time visiting. we look forward to staying here again in the future. hopefully for a longer stay next tim",
            "The 1Hotel team always raises the bar!  The atmosphere transports all guests into a sanctuary far  away from all the normal daily tasks and chores. \\n\\nThe rooms are designed to make you feel like you are one with nature with a beach not to far away. \\n\\nWe had the pleasure of dining at Harriet\\u2019s RoofTop for dinner. You can see almost a 360 of the toronto skyline. We ordered sushi, waygu, burrata and a multitude of mixed drinks. Nothing disappointed. \\n\\nWe also dined in for brunch and had their eggs Benny and focaccia French toast. All the flavours were amazing. Crazy enough the potatoes and in-house cured bacon stole the shop for me. \\n\\n1Hotel has definitely won me over from the other luxury resorts. They will become by home away from home from now on",
            "The 1 Hotel is a perfect execution of luxury sustainability. With a full gym and classes available to experience. Great restaurants and a rooftop with a 360 view!! They also have a house car for transportation within the area, but most of the hot spots are within walking distance of the hotel",
            "Location is great for exploring Toronto.\\n\\nWe stayed as a family of 4 in two adjacent rooms (king and panoramic king). The rooms are spacious and decorated with a simple luxury, modern and sustainable vibe. Equipped with all you need including nespresso machines, hairdryers and irons!\\n\\nThe hotel even provided Dyson hair straighteners when my wife\\u2019s UK model would not work with the power supply (thank you!).\\n\\nBathrooms are well appointed with luxurious Bamford cosmetics.\\n\\nGood amenities including a gym, rooftop bar and pool.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the excellent 1 Kitchen breakfasts, but were unable to make the most of the very highly rated Casa Madera (which was booked out privately the only night we could make it \\uD83D\\uDE14) or the rooftop bar which closes very early Monday-Wednesday (1030pm). \\n\\nThe lobby bar was a great place for cocktails, with a chilled ambience and live entertainment.\\n\\nThanks to all the team for looking after us",
            "I liked my room very much. It\\u2019s we\\u2019ll decorated and comfortable. These days hotels are not so much a place to lay your head, but a place you can immerse yourself in, to eat, hang out, exercise and enjoy yourself. They know this too, which is why they create the ambience they do. Hotels in all sorts of places; Rio, Tokyo; London; New York, have excellent hotels that grant you some level of exclusivity that come with staying at the hotel. They have a beautiful pool deck\\u002Flounge\\u002Froof top, well if you\\u2019re a guest, you are welcome to enjoy. If not a guest, you have to wait in line and maybe get in or not. At the 1 Hotel, not the case. You do not get access to the lounge; you do not get onto the rooftop; you are the same as anyone else even though you are paying $600 a night for a room. No exclusivity. I felt like I was just a person filling a bed. Coming back from dinner, it doesn\\u2019t matter if you want to enjoy a night cap. I found this very frustrating and it did not make me feel like a valued guest",
            "Stayed here for 3 nights recently with two of my girlfriends and we had a fabulous time! We stayed in a two queen room which was plenty of space for the 3 of us and included a lounger and side tables. The toilet was separate from the shower\\u002Fsinks so it made getting ready easier. The bathroom counter is a bit small and there isn\\u2019t a ton of room - so give yourself lots of time for getting ready!  All of the staff were extremely friendly and the location is amazing! The city is so walkable from the hotel. The pool was amazing, the drinks were so good, and the staff were attentive and friendly. Only small complaint about the pool is that the food menu is extremely limited - hard for anyone with any dietary restrictions to eat! As the pool is right outside of Harriet\\u2019s rooftop it would make sense for the hotel to offer the same menu poolside!  Also\\u2026 adding a few more mirrors around the hotel and hotel rooms would be an appreciated extra touch!   Still despite all of this, 100% a 5 star experience and would stay again! It was the perfect getaway\\u2026 the mattress was sooo comfortable and I slept like a log each night",
            "We decided to try the 1 Hotel Toronto for a theatre weekend because it was close to folk we wished to visit.  We were pleasantly surprised by by everything about the hotel from its helpful friendly staff to the emphasis on environmental sustainability.  They even arranged ground transportation to theatre which is a little further away than we were prepared to walk.  We'll be back.",
            "This hotel is more than an ordinary 5 star hotel, and offers things which you can\\u2018t buy for money. Be it the  lovely and beautifully decorated sushi at the pool deck, Neil and Myra at the front desk with great advice, Ina from housekeeping performing a really impressive and immaculate turn down service, or the pool staff always finding a way to accomodate us. \\nOur double Queen room was nice and very quiet, although we desperately missed some more hooks  (the only real improvement potential). Outstanding towel quality, nicely designed towelling robes. \\nThe hotel location is good, the bar extremely nice, the fitness area very well equipped, and the restaurant 1 kitchen ok if you want an easy meal (good food but was nearly empty in the evening\\u002F portions partly very small\\u002F not competitive vs many other restaurants in the area). \\nAll in all: I would always pick this hotel again",
            "No detail is spared when you stay at 1 Hotel. This is my second experience at a 1 Hotel property, and it just keeps getting better. Jonah, Shamar, and Omar at the front desk\\u002Fbell services were an incredible help to us each day. Maxine and Sabrina were wonderful in the Flora Lounge. The danish and breakfast options in Flora Lounge were fantastic. Lunch at 1 Kitchen was extra fresh and the Aperol Spritz bar was so fun. We visited the Rooftop and my goodness, the views are incredible and the ambiance is unmatched. The rooms are impeccable and their commitment to sustainability at every point in your stay is truly remarkable. How do we get more hotels to be like 1 Hotel?",
            "What an awesome, beautiful eco-friendly hotel with amazing interior decor. Would definitely stay here again! I want to check out the one in LA and NY. This hotel came recommended by coworkers who have stayed here before",
            "We have stayed in many nice hotels in many cities around the world. We visit Toronto every summer. I can confidently say that 1Hotel Toronto might be our favorite hotel EVER. \\n\\nWe stayed for 3 nights recently and from start to finish the service just wowed us. In fact, even before we arrived I had been in close touch with Robin Elliot, the Chief Concierge, who was the essence of professionalism, kindness and helpfulness when it came to recommendations and requests. He certainly did not disappoint when we finally had the pleasure of meeting him in person, and for the duration of our stay. Robin made our trip so memorable, going the extra mile constantly to always make sure we were taken care of and happy - which we most definitely were. His warm and engaging personality, positive energy and authentic desire to help blew us away. All 4 of us couldn't stop talking about how wonderful this person is! And we are not usually a gushy family!! \\n\\nEveryone from the front desk staff to housekeeping to the folks at the restaurant\\u002Fbar (1 Kitchen is a fabulous place to eat btw - we had 2 excellent meals here) exemplified the 1Hotel brand - super friendly, positive, there to help you and ensure your stay is perfect. \\n\\nAside from the superior service level (which for me makes or breaks the vacation), the room was beautiful, the fixtures pristine, the bathroom just so beautiful. We don't typically love doorless showers when traveling with kids BUT this one was so tastefully done and in keeping with the natural, sustainable, eco-friendly theme of the hotel which we loved and appreciated that we didn't mind at all. The lobby and interior of the building was also just so gorgeous - reflecting the hotel philosophy oh-so stylishly. Gym was fantastic which both myself and my teen son frequented. \\n\\nWe left feeling so radiantly satisfied with our experience and thrilled that we have found, THE ONE, no pun intended! This will definitely be where we stay from now on, whenever we visit Toronto. We already can't wait for our next visit next summer, if not sooner",
            "My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our four night stay at 1 Hotel. It is by far one of the finest hotels at which we've stayed over the years. The overall vibe throughout is calming and nature inspired. The large beautifully arranged lobby\\u002Flounge is where small bites can be ordered and live music enjoyed on weekends. We stayed in an upper level suite and loved the comfortable sectional sofa, having a shower and freestanding tub, and a window that opened for fresh air. The staff is committed to making it's guests feel appreciated and will do whatever it can to enhance their stay. Thank you Mira, for going above and beyond.  The concierge, Robin, was exactly who you'd hope for in any city. He is kind, respectful and very helpful. He suggested a local spa retreat and wonderful restaurants including Adrak, an elegant Indian restaurant with excellent food and over-the-top service. We have highly recommended 1 Hotel to our friends and will definitely return next year",
            "Took my family to 1 Hotel last week after a recommendation from a work colleague. Can\\u2019t express how incredible the experience was from the moment we arrived. The hotel itself looks beautiful and we decided to dine at 1 Kitchen, which is one of the in house restaurants. Our server was Hailey who took care of our group as if we had been coming there for years. Service was fantastic in every way. Prompt seating and excellent recommendations, we loved everything about the experience. A special thanks to Clem for the cocktail recommendation for my wife and I. We have different tastes when it comes to drinks so he was sure to recommend a cocktail each of us would enjoy and he was right on the money. My favourite of the night was the Avocado Picante! We will definitely be returning and hopefully soon. If you haven\\u2019t been to 1 Hotel yet I would highly recommend getting yourself there as soon as possible",
            "We came to stay at 1hotel for the weekend before Valentine's day and our experience from start to finish was absolutely comfortable, enchanting and the most wholesome couple of days imaginable. The staff went above and beyond from the entrance all the way to the hotel room. This is without even mentioning the staff at 1kitchen  Adrien, Nelson, Oscar, Julie, and Hanna had us spoiled and welcomed we couldn't help but visit the restaurant 4 times in 2 days. The kitchen staff abosultely blow us away with the food not to mention the desserts. Definitely worth the visit",
            "I have stayed in my fair share of hotels and 1 Hotel Toronto is now one of my very favorites. The service, property, and amenities are impeccable. Brooklyn Lambert, the front office supervisor, and Robin Elliott, the chef concierge, both could not have been more helpful and such a pleasure to meet. They went above and beyond to make sure my son and I had a wonderful week at their hotel. The hotel is VERY enviromentally conscious. I have never stayed at a hotel where all of the water is filtered. Being able to fill up a water pitcher and have cold fresh water during our long stay was definitely a nice feature. \\n\\nAnd, the location can't be beat! They are just a couple of blocks off of King West and Queen West streets. Which means you are a short walk from a ton of restaurants and shops. The restaurants in the hotel are also all amazing! We ate at 1 Kitchen the majority of our time in Toronto! The hotel is also walking distance to the CN Tower and Rogers Centre, where the Blue Jays play. We walked to a game and were there in 15 minutes. In addition to the prime location they also have compimentary Teslas to take you places, within a certain distance from the hotel. There is also a grocery store a very short walk away.\\n\\nWe did take advantage of having a very nice gym and pool. If you have kids you need to be aware of the age limit for the pool. Even with the age limit, they were very accommodating for my 15 year old son to go to the pool during the day. There are personal trainers you can book time with, however I didn't have the opportunity to do that. \\n\\nI look forward to staying at any of the 1 Hotels. I certainly wouldn't stay anywhere else in Toronto. And, a huge thank you to Brooklyn and Robin for helping make my 50th birthday stay in Toronto wonderful",
            "1 Hotel is probably one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in! From the furniture to the food, everything has been thought out from start to finish. The customer service team is very attentive, and the plants in the hotel add such a gorgeous, fresh touch. Highly recommend staying here",
            "Such a wonderful hotel. Rooms are so well organised, plenty of useful sockets and recharging points  (in the right places), spacious (we had a twin queen room for our family of four and it was very  comfortable). The hotel is eco- friendly and absolutely stunning inside. Everything was perfect, from the moment delightful Meera checked in us, to the hotel drop off at our hotel. It was so nice to come \\u2018home\\u2019 after a long day and debrief on the day\\u2019s activities with Meera! Robin the chef concierge and Demet (one of the house car drivers) were also stand out members of staff. A special place, with wonderful staff all round. Slippers are to die for, fresh fruit and refreshing coolers at reception are a nice touch. A few pointers: not so near to transport (the bikes and house car more than make up for that) but walking distance to Kettleman\\u2019s (great bagel shop\\u2026and lots of other eateries. Highly recommend all round",
            "1Hotel is an awakening of the senses. From the minute you walk in, you can\\u2019t help but to  feel like you have entered a sanctuary within the city. You can\\u2019t help but to take in all the plants, natural elements and signature scent to set the mood for a relaxing stay. My husband and I stayed in room 319 and it was beyond our expectations. The room was spacious and had a walk out terrace. The bathroom has heated floors and the concrete bathtub was as luxurious as they come. The Bamford products are now my new favourite. We loved all the attention to detail in our room to help make our stay feel like home. Everyone was super friendly and attentive from the front desk to the valet. The hotel has a beautiful roof top restaurant and pool with great views of the city. The lounge is beautiful and the cocktails amazing, especially their old fashion. The gym is well appointed with everything you need including Peloton bikes. We had a fabulous breakfast at 1Kitchen and we loved that they had gluten and dairy free options. We highly recommend this hotel- nothing big chain and impersonal about it",
            "Another amazing stay at 1 Hotel! This was my first time staying at the hotel with my wife and two children. Everyone was blown away with the hotel and room. The front staff did a really good job at making my kids feel welcome and comfortable. The night staff and especially Matt Randall did an outstanding job helping with our needs. Quickly coming to the room to assist. He was very professional and exceptional with the children. Our daughter is still talking about the her stay in the big city and we will definitely be back.

            "Had no idea what to expect for an uptown hotel, but this was a sheer delight. The staff were very welcoming even though we were late due to flight delays. The room was very clean and the decor had a wonderful quirky vibe almost straight out of 1920's film noir set. Valet service was excellent. Both guys we talked to were very friendly. Had breakfast here every morning, only small selection, but designed to fulfill all the necessary food groups to fil you up for the rest of the day.

This is likely due to the thinner windows but it wasn\\u2019t unbearable. \\n\\nConvenience wise, it\\u2019s right across the street from reasonably priced municipal parking and a 3-5min walk from the subway station which makes things very convenient. \\n\\nWe had only two notable downsides. First would be that it\\u2019s very close to a shelter which means the adjoining street may appear less appealing however we were never bothered by anyone. This is by no means the fault of the hotel itself but is of note. The second was that the air conditioning unit was quite loud and rattled a lot. This could be due to it starting to age out\\u002Ffail.\\n\\nWould certainly book again",

Upon arrival we were asked if a pet bed and bowls were needed for our dog which was a pleasant surprise and greatly appreciated. There is no parking on site but there is a municipal parking garage directly across with reasonable rates. Room was very clean and check in \\u002Fout was very easy and staff were very friendly. Will definitely choose The Anndore House for any future travels to Toront",
            "Location is king when searching for a hotel, but the quality of the rooms will make or break your decision to book. The room had a great design and was comfortable. The hotel smelled amazing! The Anndore House was perfectly tucked away for a sound night of sleep, but centrally located that allowed easy movement across the city",
            "Stayed here recently on business and had a King Loft room on one of the upper floors. Room was well appointed, clean and perfectly acceptable. Had all the amenities you could want and everything worked fine. Room was serviced daily to a high standard. I didn't notice noise coming from any of the other rooms on my floor, even though there were many other people on the floor - also, I was up high enough to not be bothered by the street noise. Sure, as another review mentioned, my room did overlook a homeless shelter, but it also overlooked many other residential buildings\\u002Fapartments and restaurants - not sure that this should be a deal breaker when selecting a hotel. Very good location for dining and plenty of options in the surrounding area and about a 30 min walk to Toronto harbour and the bottom of the downtown area. \\nOverall, highly recommended and I'd stay here again if in Toronto",
            "The room was immense compared to other hotels I\\u2019ve stayed in. Rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels, ceramic mugs *as opposed to paper cups for coffee* and fun touches like a little record player with a few LPs, mini fridge.  Bathrooms and closets were huge and there was lots of room to lounge and sleep.  Great beds and comfortable nights.\\nConvenient to many theaters and museums and nightlife",
            "Beautiful hotel in a perfect position. Right in the middle of Yonge Street. Lovely large spacious room with large shower room. View from our room was amazing. Hotel was very clean and comfortable. The restaurant in the hotel (Constantines) was very expensive for what it was, especially the drinks, and not enough choice on the menu.This put us off eating there a second time. Hotel staff were accomodating and friendly. Would definitely stay there again",
            "I stayed here for business and it is a very nice hotel. Staff were excellent and the location was perfect for me off of Bloor Street. The loft style room was very comfortable and the hotel room was very quiet for sleeping. All and all an excellent value in a great location for me. Very nice",
            "Such a great location, one of my favourite places to stay in TO. Amazing access to subway too! The area is busy though and the outside noise can be a bit much for some. This last trip, the fire alarm across the street went off for an hour in the middle of the night. The walls could be a little thicker but they do provide ear plugs! The biggest issue that really is just odd, is the entrance, you would never know it\\u2019s there and it\\u2019s a bit sketchy at first, but very cool once you get inside and the real experience is there.",
            "An incredible stay, within walking distance of yorkville. The hotel entrance was only accessible my room key after 10:00 which made the hotel feel incredibly safe and the rooms were stunning. Unlike any hotel I\\u2019ve been to before. I would stay there again in a heartbeat",
            "Looked forward to a nice, upscale hotel,, based on reviews. What we got was a Comfort Inn with a face-lift, without fixing the underlying issues. We stayed in room 205 which when you tried to run the heating didn't work well and was incredibly oisy, or would turn on the A\\u002FC.  They haven't changed the windows just put plantation shutters up to block the drafts.  The toilet role holder is mounted in such a way that you have to be a contortionist to reach it.  Bedding is a quilt with a microfiber quilt cover, and a microfiber blanket...only a bottom sheet, so if you sleep warm good luck, and a very firm mattress.  Good proximity to Yonge which is a blessing, as the hotel has no parking, though a public lot across the street.  So a basic hotel but because it's been given a face-lift they are asking luxury prices, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "The Anndore is in a perfect location for accessing all Toronto's amenities. It's nice to leave the very busy Toronto streets and be enveloped in calm and quiet. The beds were comfortable, the room was clean, bathroom great, and we really appreciated the separate seating area. We also appreciated being able to store our bags. I was eating alone and found the staff in the restaurant very sensitive to making me feel comfortable, as it's not always easy to be by yourself. I would happily stay at Anndore again",
            "This hotel is in a great location for exploring downtown Toronto.  \\n\\nThe beds are comfy and the room is nice but the air con is really noisy, and this observation is based on us travelling over the last 3 months and staying in a lot of hotels.\\n\\nThe ladies at reception said that \\u201Csome people were too sensitive\\u201D and that if I turned the air con off at night that might help.  \\n\\nWhen we asked to move rooms their first question was - have you messed up your room?  Not, really customer focussed.  \\n\\nThe second rooms AC was a bit quieter but it is still a really noisy system. \\n\\nIn the second room - which was supposed to be quieter there was a letter from the manager apologising for the construction noise next door and two sets of ear plugs",
            "The Anndore House is a short couple of blocks from the landmark intersection of Yonge and Bloor Streets, and was previously the shabby Comfort Hotel. Hyatt took over the building, hired a decorator who thinks dark brown with black accents is a cheerful colour scheme for hotel rooms, and installed a restaurant and bar in most of the ground floor space. They also doubled the room rates, which still leaves them lower than other midtown hotels. The Anndore seemed clean, staff were helpful when I needed a couple of small things, and somehow, amazingly, the Comfort Hotel room doors that used to close with a jarring crash have been softened somewhat. However, practically everything in the room seemed badly arranged (awkward bathroom, tiny strange light switches, duvet suitable only for short people) and the bar didn\\u2019t seem to be open any time I wanted to make use of it. Your experience may be better, as long as you have the arm strength to open the huge heavy entrance doors. Also, watch out for the little slope in the floor right in front of the elevator",
            "We spent over 3 weeks here in December and early January . The location is excellent , less than a 100 metre from the crossing of Yonge and Bloor There is an excellent restaurant ( Constantine ) and bar in the hotel . The Crow\\u2019s Nest cafe always has really friendly staff and great coffee .\\nIt is excellent for a long term stay even in terms of the layout . You can back and forth to your rooms from the outside without having to cross reception ensuring a greater degree of privacy. \\nThe rooms are fun - I was on the 9 th floor and had a pretty decent view of the downtown buildings. They have quirky things like a record player which is also a blue tooth speaker. \\nThe key factor behind an enjoyable 3 weeks was the staff. Every interaction whether at reception, the bar , the restaurant or the cafe was very friendly and made us feel comfortable and  welcome",
            "We loved our stay at The Anndore House.  The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help us check in early and were also able to store luggage on the day of departure. The hotel and rooms were spotless. We loved our room, with 2 queen beds and a seating area. The room also had a fridge which we were able to use. I know it maybe it doesn't go with the look but maybe the room would benefit from curtains, as the white slatted blinds do let a lot of light in when it's daylight outside. The hotel was surprisingly quiet for the location. \\n\\nOne thing I will say is the neighbourhood is questionable. The hotel is located right next to a subway station which is great for getting to Downtown Toronto, however I would not walk around the area of the hotel at night,  especially not alone. We noticed a large number of drug users (openly taking drugs in the surrounding streets), and we went to a play park a  5 minute walk from the hotel where a large number of people were openly taking A Class substances. I would not let this put me off staying at the hotel again, but I guess as with every major city across the world it's important to keep your wits about you, keep valuables close etc. \\n\\nOverall a great stay and I would definitely stay at the hotel again",
            "We stayed here for our final night in Toronto following a trip to Niagara Falls. We arrived late at night and received an unwelcome reception. The lobby is connected to the restaurant so no privacy or quiet to check in. The female staff was quite unfriendly. We had emailed ahead to request a high floor room but were given one on the 2nd floor. When we entered we realised it was a single king bed rather then the two twins we booked. We returned to reception to explain but the same lady insisted it was our mistake and we had booked incorrectly. When we provided email proof she passed us over to someone else with no apology. The other man was polite and sorted this issue out but we were disappointed with her attitude. The room itself was modern with stylish decor. The room was clean but the bathroom had hairs on the towels and in the sink and chewing gum stuck to the floor. The bed was very comfortable but the room was cold despite the heater and I had to sleep with a jumper on. I expected more given the price and the previous reviews and it certainly was not the high standard hotel we expected. We would not stay again",
            "You cant fault the location, and this is why we chose this hotel.  It is in the heart of Toronto, we easy access to shops, cafes and restaurant.  Vibrant, safe area, walking distance from many attractions.\\nThe hotel itself is very nice.  Feels new, definitely modern with a great dining space and bar.  Room had a few issues, maybe it was new that s why?  The room key didnt always work in the lift, or the door.  The light switch frame fell off the wall.  Minor things that take away from the experience though. Service was overall good, reception staff, tentative, most of the times and willing to help.  Customer service style a bit haphazard, or just quite different from what you traditionally anticipate as customer service in a hotel...  For these reasons I think that value for money was not quote there, even though you basically have to pay for being in the center of Toront",
            "I stayed at Anndore House whilst visiting my family in Toronto. My room was large, but sparse, with a malfunctioning television and toilet. I was advised when I arrived that all hotel amenities were closed due to COVID and nothing was on offer to compensate. Instead of a coffee maker there were instant coffee packets. The nice looking bar was closed and no alcohol was in the room, complimentary\\u002Fcompensatory or otherwise, and the only food on premises was $5 glass jars of gummies. Perhaps at another time this would be a nice place to stay, but compared to other hotels I\\u2019ve stayed at in North America and abroad that I have stayed at during the pandemic, this stay was my worst",
            "The hotel is a nice, botique hotel and the staff were very friendly and open to any questions that were asked.  From food recommendations to things to see or do, the staff were very knowledgeable and made the trip a pleasure.  The hotel itself is north of the lake but well within a Uber\\u002FLyft ride (in winter, walkable in the warmer season) to various destinations down by the lake.   I was pleasently surprised and will definitely stay at this location again the next time I visit Toronto.",
            "This hotel is fabulous.  From the moment we arrived, we were made extremely welcome.  The interior as you walk in is beautiful and it doesn't stop there.  Everything throughout the hotel is spotlessly clean and well kept.\\nThe rooms are very spacious and well appointed and there were leaflets to let you know that you could get any number of things from reception if needed.\\nWe would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Toronto, not only is it great to stay in, but really close to everything you could wish to visit whilst also being close to transport links.  Journey to and from the airport was a breez",
            "We were going to Toronto from UK for a baby shower and also wanted to experience downtown. I booked The Anndore because I wanted to stay with my daughters in the same room, \\u201Cbonding, chat time\\u201D \\u2026 it was amazing , beautifully clean , they delivered bath robes daily when we called housekeeping, without even asking there was a knock at the door which I opened to a lovely young man delivering extra towels. The room has lovely touches like a record player and a choice of 4 albums, we played Harry Belafonte whilst having a drink in the lounge area. Lovely Pluck sleep tea bags were on the tray for a bedtime drink and we are now obsessed with them . Location was phenomenal, Yorkville has really upmarket shops  and restaurants and felt very safe to walk around \\u2026\\nAll round wonderful stay !",
            "I recently stayed at the Anndore House with my partner. We absolutely loved our stay. The location is great, right off Yonge Street and close to Yorkville. The room felt personalized and had cute touches. The shower was gorgeous and the bed was comfortable. The rooms have AC units which is nice in the summer. I felt safe staying there because they lock the front doors at night but customers have access with their key cards. Check in and check out were efficient, even with our checkout at four o'clock in the morning. I would absolutely stay here again",
            "Recently completed a three-night stay at this hotel, and was extremely pleased with the customer service we received as well as the condition of our rooms. There was a bit of a mix-up during our check-in process, in that we had booked a room with two beds, and had been assigned a King room. Staff sorted this out for us very quickly, and we were able to check in after a very long day of travel. The rooms were beautiful, and parking was available directly across the street. The location was very close to two different Subway stations. I has read that the hotel could be noisy, and we had brought a fan to mitigate this, but it was not necessary. Will definitely stay here again when we are next in toronto",
            "This place is amazing! The style of rooms, the helpful professional staff at check in make this a overall great experience.  Great well lit Public Parking right across the Street. Secure entrance makes you feel safe and in a very nice area of Toronto a minute walk to Bloor St. I keep rebooking and will continue to",
            "Excellent experience. \\nThe room is clean with a very trendy decor. \\nThe hotel is ideally located (Bloor-Yonge subway station 2 minutes walking or Green P parking on the other side of the street)\\nStaff is providing an excellent service. \\n\\",
            "Nothing beats coming back to a comfortable bed and relaxing in a space that is more like a city studio apartment (fridge no microwave) than a boring hotel room.  Wished that in-house restaurant Constantine had been open for dinner  during our stay, but finding dining options nearby was never a problem.   Lots of food options to fit most everyone\\u2019s taste and budget within walking distance along Bloor and Yonge.  Just watch your step along Yonge street, Toronto is not immune to the urban homeless problems that plague other cities like SF and NYC. Front desk and housekeeping staff were friendly and great at what they do. Public parking across the street from Anndore was convenient and taking the TTC at Bloor\\u002FYonge station was a breeze because it was so close to the hotel.  Overall, great place to stay",
            "Nice boutique property in Toronto. Overall nice rooms and great location.  Weird that in house restaurant is not part of hotel so therefore no Hyatt Globalist benefit of free breakfast and 500 in lieu of free breakfast never deposited into my account. Had a little excitement when I was there and homeless encampment next door caught on fire. 15 minutes all fires were extinguished and next morning all debris was efficiently removed.\\n\\nMain issue for me is the lack of pillow choice. Should have choice besides high thick foam pillows!!! Was tough to sleep on",
            "I was a bit hesitant about booking The Anndore House, knowing it was once a Comfort Inn \\u2013 a brand and physical older building I wouldn't typically choose. But after reading the reviews and seeing the photos of what Hyatt has done, I decided to give it a shot, and I\\u2019m so glad I did! From the moment I arrived, everything was fantastic. The hotel has a fun vibe\\u2014small, cozy, and boutique without feeling cramped. Check-in was a breeze, and I was pleasantly surprised by the size of my room. It was unexpectedly large, beautifully designed, and incredibly clean\\u2014honestly, one of the cleanest hotel rooms I\\u2019ve stayed in. Everything worked perfectly, and the bed was extremely comfortable.\\n\\nThe location, while a little further north than I needed, was just a quick subway ride away from the main spots. Even as a first-time visitor to Toronto, the TTC was easy to navigate, with the nearest station just a short walk away. The street itself has a few questionable spots, but it\\u2019s clear that the area is evolving, with newer restaurants and stores popping up.\\n\\nI enjoyed the restaurant and its overall vibe, as I ate there for breakfast each morning. The people were great, and breakfast was good, but I had a couple of very minor issues. The buffet selection, while good, was a bit limited. Additionally, the weekend breakfast hours were a bit odd\\u2014brunch started later, so I had to miss the sit-down breakfast altogether as I was heading to the airport. Fortunately, the quick cafe staff were super accommodating and made me a fresh menu item, but I do feel that a consistent breakfast schedule throughout the week would make more sense.\\n\\nAll in all, I couldn\\u2019t have asked for a better stay. I highly recommend The Anndore House and would absolutely stay here again",
            "I travel to this city quite often and have been in search of a hotel with a convenient location.  On my recent visit I did just that when I happened upon this stylish and trendy looking boutique hotel.  The hotel was within walking distance to everything I needed and everyone I was there to visit.  Very close to subways, restaurants, parking, Yorkville shopping and groceries\\u002Fcafes.  The rooms are very spacious and offer some unique touches not normally found at other hotels.  It is nestled within a neighborhood off the main streets so you feel like you are in a home away from home.  From the walkup to the entry, the Anndore house is very esthetically pleasing. The staff are very attentive and friendly. This just may be my new \\\"go to\\\" for my frequent visits to this city in the future. I am looking forward to experiencing the hotels amenities (restaurants etc.) once the COVID restrictions are lifted.\\",
            "Stayed at the Anndore as Toronto entered stage 3 of COVID-19 restriction-easing. There were no amenities, but the design of the hotel definitely made up for any missing features. Small touches like the early 20th century telephones and brass bathroom and shower taps made our stay very memorable. And the Constantine restaurant upper patio was perfect, with the tree branches and hanging lights creating a cozy ambiance",
            "Great stay in Toronto! Unique room accomidations which included vinyl records and record player in room was an awesome touch. Bed and accomidations were comfortable and the location was great. Several restaurants within a short distance",
            "Tucked away a block from Yonge\\u002FBloor is a boutique hotel that has surprises at every turn. The online photos are very reflective of what you get, both from the rooms and the rest of the hotel. Very impressed by internal security and safe vibe. The bed was super-comfy and the shampoo\\u002Fconditioner\\u002Fbody wash smelled great. Oh, and as a bonus, you could turn the bathroom light on from your bedside, and turn on\\u002Foff all the individual lights in the room from your bedside",
            "Stayed at Anndore House for five days and must say that I'm really satisfied with the hotel and its location midtown Toronto. Close to the vibrant Yonge Street and easy to reach subway or also walking downtown. With to mentioned its close location to the nice area Yorkville. The rooms are relatively large and modern with an industrial design touch, of course this is personal but I liked it",
            "Stayed in a King Loft Room. The style of the hotel is really nice - sort of quirky\\u002Findustrial with lots of nice touches in the room including the record player. The room is a pretty good size (used the space well), the 2 armchairs and table were a nice bonus and and bed was big and comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly and the bar area is really nice. \\n\\nThe main let down was the location in terms of it being noisy and a little on the rough side. Its near a main road (Yonge Street) and the windows don't offer much sound proofing. We were also next to the lift which made it noisy. Its also a bit of a walk from the main parts of Toronto. \\n\\nSo overall it was good but think where your room is located is important and important to consider where you want to be near. Our room was on a high floor which was great but west facing which had a city view but also made it noisy",
            "I had to take a few nights at a hotel in my own city due to an Emergency and was very surprised at how great this hotel is. \\nPros: The service is really above and beyond. Ask for anything and they will provide. The rooms are bigger than expected though the decor is unusual. No carpeted floors in the rooms which I love. Detachable shower heads were a plus. Two single seater couches in front of the TV for a King bed room in a hotel in downtown Toronto for about 300 a night? Wow.\\nCons: Very noisy. No soundproofing and other guests were loud on my floor. And the construction noise really vibrates throughout the room and you FEEL it. The AC is on the louder side so be ware though I didn't mind since I'm used to a loud AC. I didn't sleep the first night due to the noise outside the window. But oh well. I still gave it a 5 star because of how great the staff was. Really made me feel better at a time when I wasn't feeling great.\\",
            "I was hesitant about booking this hotel because I knew so little about it, but the stay was really nice (except for the crappy Satellite TV service during the height of the closing days of the Olympics!!!).  The rooms hve false brick walls with cool artwork, a fake rotary phone and an old-school vinyl record player!  That was a lot of fun to play with and took me back to my childhood.  The hotel is in the Yorkville neighborhood which is near Downtown Toronto as well as a homeless shelter (two doors down to the right -- so go left!).  It's also near a Tim Horton's and two strip clubs, so something for every member of the family!  I never felt unsafe there -- they lock the doors after 10pm, so the strippers don't get in- so don't forget your card key.  If you book on points, choose the valet service -- it's free.  Just give a tip.  Overall, a nice stay and I would reconsider if they FIX THE SATELLITE TV!!!",
            "Very nice boutique Hotel in Downtown Toronto with an industrial design. Staff were very friendly and engaging. All request for items like ice and extra glasses were delivered in a timely manner. Front desk staff and doorman were very nice and helpful",
            "Location is ideal for touring Toronto. Clean, unique, pleasant decor in our room.  We slept very well in the comfy bed and as far as the windows go, if you open the wooden shutters there are blackout roll down blinds.  Very modern conveniences in the room.    Staff are friendly. Get a Citypass. Visit Casa Loma. Take the subway. Only one block away.   This hotel was a great decision for us!   And the dining room is divine. Constantine's is an amazing experience.  Three nights stay on the top floor of an exceptional boutique hotel. You will not be disappointed.  Thank for helping my daughter and I make memories.",
            "This hotel is located only a few minutes walk from the intersection of Toronto\\u2019s two main subway lines. There are lots of amenities in the area even if the local streetscape is a bit sketchy. The room was roomy and very tastefully decorated with a very urban feel. Lots of closet room. Large bathroom with fantastic waterfall shower. Building is quiet. The food area downstairs is really well appointed although I don\\u2019t get a chance to eat there during my stay. Staff were very pleasant and efficient.",
            "My recent stay at The Anndore House in Toronto was a perfect blend of contemporary chic and urban comfort. The hotel\\u2019s location in the trendy Yorkville neighborhood provided a stylish retreat while being within walking distance of Toronto\\u2019s cultural attractions. My room was a haven of modern elegance, with sleek design and all the amenities I needed. The central location allowed me to explore Toronto\\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods, from Yorkville to Kensington Market. Dining at the hotel\\u2019s restaurant, Constantine, was a culinary adventure, with a menu that celebrated global flavors and creative dishes. The Anndore House exceeded all my expectations, and I eagerly look forward to my next visit to this stylish gem in Toronto",
            "This hotel is truly a hidden gem in the middle of bustling downtown Toronto. The rooms are beautifully decorated with thoughtful details, and it was surprisingly family friendly (travelled with a 2.5 year old and she loved it!) Central location close to all the major transit lines, but the hotel itself felt like a cozy oasis away from the buzz of the city. I'd stay here 100 times over",
            "A chic boutique hotel located in downtown Toronto.  The room got this retro feeling to it. love the little details and how they spend the time to decorate the room with a vinyl player but sadly, the vinyl records are all scratched up so you can't really enjoy it.  Overall a decent stay while parking across the street is abit pricey",
            "I have stayed in various hotels in Toronto and Anndore has by far the nicest room. The decor is retro + industrial and is exactly like shown on their website (less the flowers).\\nThe staff is friendly and helpful. Special shout out to Augusto at the front desk for the nice warm welcome and helpfulness. It really gave a first awesome impression of the hotel. Room cleaning staff is also very helpful and responsive for missing items from the room.\\nInside the room, spacious walkin closet and sitting area with style. Lots of well-organized cupboards and shelf space throughout the room you can move your own whole bedroom in here.\\nSome people commented on the safety outside of the hotel. It's downtown in a big city and what more needs to be said?\\nAs for other people complaining about the thin walls and noise from other rooms. I also did not find any problem. Yes you can hear some noise from the hallway but it's not different than what I have experienced in other hotels.\\nThere is no gym or swimming pool but I knew it before I booked.\\",
            "Many hotels in downtown Toronto resemble each other.  I was looking for a funkier place.  I certainly got that at the Anndore House.  Staff was welcoming.  Bar area is comfortable and one can also have access to full restaurant menu there.  Menu was lovely as were the drinks choices.  Room are fun to look at and practical as well.  Decoration and style is interesting.  Well situated also"

            "Not only are the rooms extremely small and amenities scarce, the beds are quite uncomfortable and they charge you $125 deposit upon check in, then when you check out they make you wait until a maid has gone to inspect your room and then you are permitted to receive a refund for your deposit and check out. I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING IN A DOWNTOWN TORONTO HOTEL IN MY LIFE!!! It just so happened that the card I was charged the deposit on was actually stolen and frauded the night prior to checkout and the hotel REFUSED to refund my money and said I would need to call the manager who would be in Tuesday. It was Sunday morning when this was taking place (what kind of hotel doesn't have a manger on duty on a weekend? it's their busiest time!) They wouldn't refund my deposit on any of my credit cards or other debit card, it HAD to be the EXACT debit card I paid the deposit on (the account which was frauded and now inactive). This place is not worth saving a few dollars for the hassle you put up with and the hotel itself isn't even nice. I would much rather stay somewhere that treats their guests as valued customers",
            "We were very happy with Hotel Victoria.  The location is close to so much and easy to find.   There is a fantastic restaurant across the street (Irish Emassy pub) and the hotel has a great breakfast restaurant attached...not cheap but excellent food.  Our room was very small but nice and the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in.  Our friends had a king room so they had a bench and a couple of chairs so thats where we visited.  The staff were lovely.  We felt the value was great and will stay here again.  Parking is expensive and awkward but that's Toronto.  All in all we were very happy with our choice",

Thank you Hotel Victoria for a great experience",
            "My husband and I stayed at Hotel Victoria in Toronto for three nights in early November, 2011.  Very disappointing...we arrived around 7 pm amid traffic.  There was no designated unloading space for our car.  There is no valet service and we had to unload our car by ourselves.  The staff person on duty was of no help and was very dismissive of our need for assistance.  We got to our room and found it was located next to the elevator so we aked for a different room based on our reservation request.  We did get a new room, but were told we might have to move later.Fortunately we did not have to move.  Although the room was pleasant, the bathroom was in need of serious repairs.  The wallpaper was coming off all over.  Our room swipe cards never worked and we had to go to the desk almost every time we came in.  The day staff was more helpful.Overall, we were very displeased with Hotel Victoria and would not recommend the hotel",

Walk to theater also 10 min. Easy check in with a delightful staff member. Rooms and bathrooms are tiny as with all hotels of this type, but when you're not there much who cares? We were also three adults so could manage sharing one small bathroom (full length mirror outside the bathroom helped). Mini fridge was an unexpected perk; due to small hotel, no ice on every level, have to go to basement - easy or someone from front desk will bring to you. We blew a fuse with hairdryer; a maintenance person came up within five minutes and problem solved. Sadly we forgot a pair of shoes in the closet; happily, hotel kindly accommodated and sent the shoes to us for $25. Love that service! There is no parking specifically at this hotel but there is a structure just around the block on Wellington St (Indigo Pkg Garage), for $30 (American) per night, AND lots of spaces for charging electric vehicles, a pleasant surprise. Would highly recommend this lovely place",
            "We spent two nights at the Hotel Victoria aug 5-6. We had a queen room and like previous posters have said the room was very small. The location was great as the Wife being a shop-Alcoholic had a short walk to the Eaton Center and I being a avid baseball fan had less than a fifeteen minute walk to the Rogers Center. Lots of great dining choices near by and the noise from Yonge Street wasn't a problem, just the odd siren like any other downtown hotel. As there is no onsite parking We parked about 8 minutes away on the esplanade at a manned parking lot at the end of church street. $30.00 for two and a half days which wasn't too outrageous. Would We return to the Victoria? Likely if the price was right but We like to try different places so not likely anytime soon.\\",
            "My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Victoria.\\n\\nPros\\n1. Hotel is clean and well maintained.\\n2. Staff were polite enough - they could be warmer and friendlier but nonetheless acceptable and par for the course in a big city.\\n3. Compares favorably against other establishments of similar rating and room rates in both USA and Canada. \\n4. Room is well-decorated, spacious and extremely comfortable with clean and new linen and towels, cable TV, iron and ironing board, coffee maker and free WiFi internet (which works!)\\n5. Conveniently located to shopping, restaurants and, for those keen on walking, within walking distance of the business district and many tourist attractions including the Hockey Hall of Fame, the Waterfront, Air Canada Centre (Toronto Maple Leafs), Roundhouse Park, CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Wayne Gretzky's, Roy Thomson Hall, Canada's Walk of Fame, Eaton Centre, etc.\\n6. Hockey Hall of Fame is only a 2 minute walk away.\\n7. OverEasy, the onsite restaurant, serves fantastic food for breakfast and lunch, at reasonable prices.\\n8. Great Burger Kitchen is a 5 minute walk away at 9 Church St. Possibly the cheapest food within walking distance of the hotel, yet the burgers were fantastic! Especially important as most restaurants in the immediate area are costly.\\n\\nCons\\n1. No on-site car parking. Note that there is a City of Toronto (Green P) municipal parking facility nearby at 2 Church St. It is a covered and secured parking station for about $14 per day. While the carpark is nearby, it was slightly inclined uphill and very inconvenient with large luggage bags.\\n2. On-site restaurant, OverEasy, is not open for dinner (wish it was!)\\n\\nSummary\\nI have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, particularly at the discounted room rate I was lucky enough to secure, plus the convenience of location to the primary attractions we wanted to visit eg HHOF. Would we stay again? Yes definitely.\\n\\nI am giving the Hotel Victoria 4 Stars, not as any suggestion of hotel star-classification, but as a reflection of our satisfaction with the establishment. A thumbs up!\\n\\nA humungous thanks should you rate this review as helpful. Happy travels",
            "We rode the train in from Sarnia, and we were very pleased with the ease of locating the Hotel Victoria from the train station. We were also happy to find that the subway was just down the road and many great restaurants and things to see were nearby. \\nWe stayed towards the back of the 8th floor, and were pleased with how quite the hotel was. We heard very little hotel or street noise. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and although the room was small, it was plenty big enough for the two of us. We spent very little time in the room as we were out exploring so the small room didn't both us. \\nBeing that we were in the room so little, we had very little interaction with the staff. Though on the few occasions we did speak with those at the desk, they were pleasant and helpful.\\nThe only problem I had was with the mildew and mold in the shower. Being an old building, I can see that ventilation may be a problem. It appears to me that a little bit of bleach would go a long way. Aside from this one issue, we found the room to be very clean and well kept. The linens were pristine, the floors were immaculate, and the rest of the bathroom was well cared for.\\nIf we visit Toronto again, we would definitely stay at the Hotel Victoria for the price and location",
            "We stayed at the Hotel Victoria for 3 nights during an amazing holiday in Canada. The hotel is in a perfect situation for exploring the city, as it is steps away from the subway (king), and an easy walk to Union Station. From the airport we took an airport bus to Fairmont Royal York (opposite station) and walked to Hotel Victoria.\\n\\nWe has a King room with a huge comfortable bed, fridge and coffee making facilities. Everything clean and tidy, and most important to us at the time good air-conditioning, it was 35 degrees at the time..phew.\\n\\nNo complimentary breakfast, as there were alterations being made when we were there, but there are places just down the street to eat, Richtree market being the best.\\",
            "We booked a four night stay at Hotel Victoria in Toronto for a holiday vacation (December, 2013).  We were convinced by the internet pictures and descriptions of the hotel as a charming place to stay, and by the description in Fodor's 2012 guide to Toronto and Niagara Falls.  Our bottom line: the experience was so awful that we spent a good part of the first evening in the hotel finding another place to stay and checked out the following morning.  There were so many things to dislike: the room we stayed in was tiny and claustrophobic.  The bathroom was so small you essentially were in danger of tripping over the toilet upon entering the bathroom.  The heating system was absolutely terrible: the vent poured out heat at an extremely high temperature, and there was no way to modify it.  When we turned the heat off, we were freezing.  We spent the night with the heat on as low as possible and the window open, and got up continually throughout the night to adjust the heat and modify the degree to which the window was open.  There was no good solution to this problem:  we were alternately hot and sweating or freezing cold.  Fodor's indicated that a \\\"pro\\\" of the hotel was \\\"gym privileges at nearby health club.\\\"  This is absolutely misleading.  First, there was a hefty fee to use the \\\"nearby\\\" club; and in addition, it was several blocks from the hotel, which is not appealing when having to make a trip back after a work out.  Another problem was location: there was not much around at night, so options for meals were limited.  The only positive thing we can say about this hotel is that staff were gracious in allowing us to leave without penalty.  \\n\\nOne final comment: for people who still use print travel guides: my experience over years is that Frommer's is consistently reliable, Fodor's is not.  The only reason we used Fodor's guide is that we could not find a Frommer's that was as recent as Fodor's.  I will never pay for a Fodor's guide again",
            "I thought it would be worth it to stay really close to the main attractions in Toronto, but next time I'll pay the cab fare and stay somewhere else.  The room hardly had any standing space after I put my two pieces of luggage down.  The washroom had no amenities, neither did the room (there was no space for amenities anyway).  There was absolutely NO VIEW, and the staff basically ignored us since we were young.\\",
            "The room (2 queen beds) was very comfortable. The location was fantastic. The service was friendly. The price was among the best I could find downtown.\\n\\nThe only issue was that I never received an email confirming my booking. When I called about this, the lady confirmed my booking verbally and said she would try to send the confirmation by email. Another guest I spoke to had the same situation. Oddly, I received an email after my stay asking for feedback about the stay.\\n\\nA couple small things to note. The elevator is very slow, just be patient. And there was no fridge in our room, which was unfortunate as we had leftovers from dinner to keep refrigerated.\\n\\nAll in all, I would definitely stay there again when visiting downtown Toronto",
            "Arrived tired after a long flight from England to find that our room had been cancelled and sold to some one else. They had informed me, I later found, by e-mail whilst I was on the plane. We were then given a small room with a double bed that I had to share with my sister before moving to our booked room the next day. We subsequently found out that there were 2 conferences on in Toronto that day so all hotels were full. The staff did not care, were not apologetic, never smiled the whole time we were there. We were offered a free buffet breakfast as compensation - wow!!!\\nApart from that the beds are very comfortable and the hotel is in a good location in Downtown Toronto. Would not bother to eat in 'Over Easy', the Marche just a minute down the street is much better, cheaper and has a huge choice.\\nThe staff in this hotel need to definitely go on a customer service course as they have a 'do not care, not my problem attitude' - not a good advert for visitors to Toronto",
            "Pictures are deceiving.This hotel is old and ugly. I first booked a business queen room. The room was so small that I immediately changed my room to a double queen.\\n\\nThe room was larger but still unfunctional. My telephone was deaf and the apple tv they offer,would not work. I called for matinence and there was no such thing at this hotel. At this point I demanded a full refund. I moved over to one king street west at a cheaper rate. I was in heaven on the 40th floor of my new hotel.\\n\\nThe hotel victoria is not a cute little boutique hotel as advertised. It is tired and in desperate need of renos. I recommend the doubletree by Hilton on chestnut street for similar rated hotels but more modern and comfortable. One king street west hotel is the bomb Of hotels for the luxury factor",
            "My fiance & I just got back from a wonderful weekend in Toronto.  We picked Hotel Victoria because it was less than 5 minutes walking distance to the ACC and other attractions that we wanted to go to.  Also, Expedia had a 'web special' rate on the hotel for $105 + tax.  The Hotel itself and our room, were very clean, and the frontdesk staff were helpful and offered us an early check-in.  Parking for the hotel was not included, but very close by in Commerce Court on Wellington St.  For approx  28 hours, our parking fee was $24.00, which was reasonable.  We also ate at \\\"Over Easy\\\" the adjoining all-day breakfast restaurant.  The restaurant was very clean and bright, and the food was fresh and homemade.\\nIf you're looking for good value (by Toronto standards) on a night's stay with lots of nearby amenities, and nothing luxurious, this is an excellent pick",
            "Unobtrusively tucked away on Yonge Street,  the historic Victoria is what I would consider to be a little gem.  We spent only one night here while in town for a concert, but we would definitely come back again! Our party occupied two Deluxe Twin rooms - one on the seventh floor, and one on the 2nd floor. The one on the 7th floor was definitely the better of the two (much larger, and with a better view), but both rooms were clean (the bathrooms scrupulously so), and the atmosphere was an oasis of quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a big city. In the case of the Victoria, \\\"old\\\" does not mean run-down -- indeed, it was much better maintained than many slick new establishments. While lacking in some of the amenities ~ such as a heated pool, a workout center, an in-house restaurant, and room service ~ that some people might consider necessities, we found the Victoria to be charming.  The Victoria is an excellent choice at a very attractive price point. It was within reasonable walking distance from parking and many downtown attractions. The continental breakfast was light, but ample; the staff congenial and helpful",
            "Great location, close to everything in Toronto, a short walk from Union station. A quiet boutique hotel with very patient and helpfull staff, great for us as we just got off a transatlantic flight. Clean all over with everything you need. Good breakfast with a good selection of food to chose from. \\nA bit small rooms, but still we wanted for nothing",
            "We stayed Jun13-15 in the Queen deluxe on the 7th flr. The room was exactly the same as in the picture. The beds were comfy and rooms were very clean. Recommend keeping the fan on to cover street noise. The window blinds do not cover the windows and makes for a very bright 7am. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The restaurant on site was more expensive than Sunset Grill which was only a few blocks north. This hotel is in central downtown within walking distance of shopping, the Rogers Centre and the harbour.  We would definitely recommend this hotel to couples who need a comfortable room to sleep after enjoying the sites of beautiful downtown Toronto. We look forward to our return visit",
            "This boutique hotel was very nice. Everything was super clean. The room was a little small but fine for us since we were only staying one night. We were able to check in a little early which was nice. There is no parking but they directed us to a municipal lot a couple blocks away. We parked there overnight and paid about $38CAD when we left the next day, which from my understanding is pretty decent for downtown Toronto. It was nice to be right in the city and be in walking distance to a lot of things. Overall a great value, I would definitely stay here again.",
            "To be honest with you, I was little bit worried before staying at the hotel after the reviews we had read on the site. This was our final stop on our 4wk trip around Canada where we had stayed in delightful b and bs and small inns. I even went as far as checking the web for any last minute deals at another hotel.\\nWe were very surprised by the accomodating and friendly staff at the front desk who provided maps and organised our tour to Niagara. When we checked in, they even notified us that the rate quoted in our email had been reduced because of specials they were offering. We were surprised that our room was modern, clean and comfortable. There was plenty of room (we stayed in a deluxe room with queen bed).\\nFor breakfast, they served warm muffins, croissants, bread, and cereal. Not bad for a meal that is included in the rate. The breakfast room was a bit dark, and small. The lobby, and lift could do with a bit of a face lift, but the most important was our room.\\nThe hotel is a few minutes walk to Eaton Centre, Air Canada Centre, and CN Tower. The subway is only a few steps away. Excellent location.\\",
            "I was more than pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I arrived late and was welcomed quickly and warmly by the desk staff. It took minutes to check me in, and I was in my room. The hotel must have been renovated because for such an old historic hotel, it was very modern and comfortable. I could hear some street noise outside, but I couldn't hear a peep from surrounding rooms in any direction.\\n\\nThe bed was very VERY comfortable - I slept like a baby in it. Highly recommend it for the beds alone!\\n\\nAnd I have to comment on the cleanliness... because I was trying to squeeze lotion out of their provided little bottle in the bathroom when the bottle exploded on me... But what impressed me as I wiped up the lotion from the hardwood floor was those tissues did not have a speck of dust or dirt on them - this was one super clean room! Can't be sure it would pass one of those tests they do on the shock shows, but I can't think of many places in a Toronto winter with floors that clean!\\n\\nThe hotel is located on the Eastern edge of the \\\"PATH\\\", Toronto's underground city. You still had to step outside to access the PATH, but it was literally next door so not too bad given how extremely cold it was when I was there. The hotel is close to Union Station and the business district (all accessible by the PATH - but ask for a map otherwise you'll get lost!). \\n\\nIt wasn't very close to any stops made by the airport express bus - the nearest stops were about 10 minutes walk away (I imagine the Union Station bus stop was once upon a time close - until they began whatever is causing the monster construction there that has shut down the streets in that area for a few years now and the bus has to detour to quite a ways away...",
            "I was a bit apprehensive at first, after reading some of the reviews; however, I was pleasantly surprised once I arrived at the hotel. We arrived early in the morning, although check in is only at 3, the staff made arrangements for our room to be ready for us to be able to rest. During our wait they offered a complimentary continental breakfast, took our baggages, so we could eat, sit and relax while we waited. Within a half hour our room was ready. Now that's service !!\\n\\nThe rooms were very nicely decorated, very clean, a bit on the small side but I really didn't mind, you have plenty of room to move around. The bed was comfortable, the rooms were quiet, we had two great nights of rest.\\n\\nThe complimentary continental breakfast had a good variety, cereal, muffins, toasts, croissants, cookies, fruits... everything fresh and delicious.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly, greated us everytime we came by the lobby. They were helpfull answering all our questions about the city and what to visit.\\n\\nWe will definitely be staying at the Hotel Victoria again on our next visit to Toronto.\\",
            "Disclaimer:  I am not being compensated in any way to write this review.  I'm just an occasional traveler.  The Hotel Victoria is in downtown Toronto, about a 12- to 15-minute walk away from the train station (Union Station). It's a boutique hotel with rooms that are on the small side, but nicely appointed.  Breakfast was not included with the room.  We stayed two nights in September 2019.\\n\\nThe hotel itself is nice enough, but the front desk could really use some training on interacting with the public.  We had originally booked a Deluxe King room. After checking in, we discovered that the room appeared to be on the other side of the wall from the elevator.  We went back down to the front desk and asked if we could be moved to another king room. The woman told us that all the king rooms were basically in the same location on the various floors.  She offered a queen room and she and my wife went back upstairs so my wife could check out the room.  On the way, the front desk woman stopped by the king room that we had originally booked and told my wife she had to check it to make sure we \\\"didn't take anything.\\\"  After this insult, we should have just canceled our reservation and found somewhere else.  We ended up staying two nights and then moved on to a nicer hotel (that was actually cheaper) in the same area downtown",
            "We read good reviews on this website and thought the location was convenient since it's a few blocks from the train station. Upon seeing the front of the building, we were worried. It  looked run down, and upon entering the lobby looked even worse. Pipes with insulation hanging off them came out of the ceiling, and everything needed a coat of paint. We got the key to our room and went up in the elevator. The room wasn't completely uninhabitable, but for $130 a night I was expecting something better than a flophouse. \\n\\nMost of the furnishings looked ancient, the rug was obviously old and not clean, and the room was an odd shape and also very dark. The only window looked into a brick air shaft. \\n\\nWe went to the desk to complain, and they explained that there weren't that many other rooms in our price range. We got the keys to a more recently renovated room on the 2nd floor, but it wasn't much better. The light-colored rug was almost black in front of the door and the room was tiny. The window was about 5 feet about the floor with a through-the-wall air conditioner below it. \\n\\nWe checked out and found a room at the Day's Inn Hotel next to the old Maple Leaf Gardens. It was quite a bit cheaper and MUCH nicer. It even had a view. Don't stay at the Hotel Victoria, you will regret it. There are much better bargains around Toronto if you look",
            "I was here for one night on business.  I did a lot of calling around as I am familiar with Toronto and its hotels, this was by far the best value for a limited budget.\\n\\nRoom was clean, bed was big and comfortable, desk was a little too small, view was non-existent but that was fine by me.  Location is great, right downtown, although parking is a pain; I parked at Nathan Phillips Square because all the local parking lots go astronomical for weekdays, so I parked from 3:00 Sunday to 3:00 Monday afternoon for less than $20.00, although I was a ten minute walk from the hotel.\\n\\nWish I'd known about the free internet as I would have taken my laptop; I ended up on a late night run up Yonge St. to an internet cafe to obtain some information I could have gotten for free in my room.\\n\\nPrice is the best thing; it's pretty high season in Toronto, but it was only $135 for a queen room for a night; lowest alternative was $179.  This place is better located than the HoJo on Avenue Road and Bloor, although the latter is a bit cheaper.  I'd place them in the same ballpark quality wise.\\n\\nPeople complain about no restaurant and bar.  I don't get it - Toronto has hundreds or thousands of great restaurants and bars, who would eat at the hotel?  Great Irish bar right across the road where I capped the night with a couple of pints.  Lots of restaurants within short distances",
            "My first experience with this hotel was when my boyfriend and I arrived in Toronto and missed the turn for the parking lot. We got very lost because of all the one-ways and could not figure out how to get back. I called the hotel for help and the woman was quite rude. Saying things like \\\"That's what I just said\\\" and \\\"That's what I'm trying to telling you\\\", etc (I took down her name but I accidentally deleted it). When we finally got parked (which was a NIGHTMARE) and got to the hotel, we checked in. We stayed for four days, three nights, and the staff never once said hello to us as we were coming in or going out. That is not \\\"superior customer service\\\" (as is said on their website). The room that we had, which was a standard queen was very small, however since it is a boutique hotel it was what I was expecting. The room was fine but there were markings all over the walls in the bedroom and bathroom. There were pieces of wood missing from the walls and the wallpaper was peeling. There were also black stains on the sheets and a mark on the head board. On the website it says that the bathrooms and guestrooms are newly renovated but if that is true then either they don't take good care\\u002F clean properly or they just didn't do a good job. The sink was old and cracking and there were tiles missing in the shower (the website makes it sound like the bathrooms are large but the shower was TINY, I could barely fit in it. When I dropped my razor it was almost impossible for me to pick it up. I feel that I must add that I am 5' 7\\\" and 120 pounds so I am not a big person.) Also the toilet was wobbly. The website says that the hotel (guestrooms and bathrooms) are newly renovated but it appears that only the lobby was. On the Saturday that we were there it was raining and so we asked the man at the front desk if he had an umbrella that we could borrow. He looked at us suspiciously and asked us what our room number was. When we told him, he gave us an umbrella and said \\\"make sure you bring that back\\\". When we went outside and opened the umbrella it was broken and wouldn't stay up. With all that being said, the hotel was in a great part of town and we enjoyed being close to many things",
            "We stayed in the renovated rooms (asked for them specifically on booking) and they were fabulous.  Our rooms were richly appointed with excellent quality linens and other furnishings.  Apple TV was available, as well as wireless internet service (free).  The lobby is gorgeous, and the staff friendly and helpful.  We noted that housekeeping was meticulous and everything, from rooms to common areas were clean and tidy.  You cannot beat the location of this hotel on Younge Street.  You are within walking distance to CN Tower, many fine restaurants, and trolleys that will take you to many great points of interest.  The downstairs restaurant is also pretty good - food is great (especially for breakfast), and prices are reasonable, although service was so-so.  Value for money is spot-on here, and we would definitely recommend.  We shall return",
            "I discovered this hotel through Tripadvisor. I was looking for a place that was reasonably priced, given the fact that it was downtown, and a place that was conveniently located. Thankfully, this hotel delivered both and we stayed 3 nights. This place is excellent!!! Note: my review is for their DELUXE room.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\n1) Rooms are clean, new, and modern. Incidentally, I'm pretty sure the paint in some of the hallways was only a few days old. Our deluxe room came equipped with all the standard stuff but it also had a mini-fridge and, surprisingly, free all-you-can-watch Apple TV. While I didn't watch a lot of it, I did watch some and it was great. The place has a boutique feel.\\n\\n2) Location is Yonge St. This place is a 5-minute walk to Union Station, the Hockey Hall of fame is about a block down, there's a 24-hour grocery store that's accessible with a short walk, it's about 10 minutes walk to the Harbourfront, etc. The short of it: location is top-notch; you can walk everywhere. There's a Subway literally next door, along with a restaurant in the hotel, and Starbucks and Shoppers Drugmart are a block away.\\n\\n3) Staff. They were professional, helpful. Any problems we had were quickly taken care of. Even the cleaning staff were keen to help out when we had issues with our TV.\\n\\n4) Free Wi-Fi. Needless to say, many of the so-called top-tier hotels still charge for this in 2012. Hotel Victoria's was consistent and quick and hassle-free.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\n1) While the rooms were new and clean, the hotel clearly had some issues with its building contractors. The room flooring must have been installed hastily because it creaked pretty much everywhere you walked on it. While the bathroom was also clean and new, the tub was already pulling away from some of the sealant between it and the tiles. These were just minor, incidental things, but they were noticeable.\\n\\n2) The curtains didn't fully darken our room. The light from outside kept the room brighter than it should have been at night",
            "A couple of years ago, I stayed here for the first time for one or two nights. It was by far the best-value mid-range accomodation I've stayed in in Toronto, because it's downtown, close to the train station and comfortable. I've travelled the world and have stayed in a wide range of accomodations, and the room where I stayed in the Hotel Victoria stands out in my memory for its cushy bed and nice bathroom.  Other places I've stayed in the city were overpriced and far-flung, or merely far-flung and cheap but not worth it. \\n\\nSince I'll be travelling by rail between Montreal and Windsor, I've decided to give the Hotel Victoria another go.\\",
            "Hotel Victoria has a great location near many of Toronto's attractions, if you are looking for the fast pace of downtown Toronto. Our family booked two rooms and both were very clean and beautifully decorated. A continental breakfast is included, and the croissants were delicious! The hotel staff is very friendly. The only drawback is that the hotel does not have parking facilities. The closest public parking lot is about 3 blocks away and it will add up if your stay is longer than a night. Overall, staying at Victoria Hotel was very pleasant",
            "Great location poor hotel.\\nThe hotels location as great within walking distance of most if the tourist locations in Toronto.but the hotel look like it's been renovated on the cheap. Our door to our room you could see through the gap when closed as the lock was poorly fitted and you could hear when anyone walk in the corridor,our TV didn't work I asked the staff to fix it but they didn't fix it even though I asked repeatedly.wifi was poor.and we couldn't use the Aircon as it was like a jet engine in the room The room has poor lighting and very expensive for what is a very small room. \\nThis place is best if you want a over night stay just sone where to sleep if you have been to a game or concert but not a long stay.no restaurant\\u002Fbreakfast facilities 2 star a bes",

            "We just returned from Toronto and stayed at the Hotel Victoria on Yonge Street from June 11th-June 15th. I was hesitant at first because of the other reviews posted but from past experience I decided to go with my gut, and with what Frommers had recommended. \\n\\nI made the reservation online and received a prompt response. About a week before we left I emailed them and asked to ensure we received a non-smoking room. I just didn't want to take any chances and all was perfect upon arrival. We checked in about one hour ahead of schedule which was nice b\\u002Fc we wanted to get out and about asap. The staff behind the reception desk seemed to change often which we found amusing. They were all pleasant, not overly, but pleasant and easy to deal with. \\n\\nAs indicated in other reviews, the room was small but clean, and this was more important to me. Clean is a must. The bathroom was quaint and our view was, well, a brick wall but we spent very little time in the hotel room so we weren't worried. The temperature rose as the week went on and the air conditioning worked well. Each day we returned to find our room spotless. The one drawback was the lack of a munchie machine in the hotel. This sounds silly I know but when Game 5 of the Stanley Cup is on you need your munchies. There was a pop machine and ice machine in the basement though. \\n\\nNext door to the hotel was a little newstand\\u002Fconvenience store. We only noticed it on day 3 or so and wish we had found it earlier. It was called International News. The woman there was so nice and welcoming and very chatty. It was great. She asked where we were from and where we were going, etc. This was a great place to grab snacks to sneak into the Jays game. The only problem is it closed around 7pm, but that's ok. The woman there made up for it. \\n\\nThis hotel is all about location, location, location. It was about a 5 min walk from the Eatons Centre. Yonge Street is incredible, full of shopping and restaurants. I highly recommend Eggspectations just up the road and Shopsy's across the street. Yum. It was also practically right next door to the Hockey Hall of Fame. This made it easy to run around, come back and rest a minute, and then keep exploring. \\n\\nThe one thing I really liked about Hotel Victoria is that they were not all gushy over us. We would come and go, they would say hello, and that was about it. The night before we checked out I was stressing b\\u002Fc our flight was only at 8pm and the thought of dragging our luggage around terrified me. I asked the girl at the desk (I think her name was Carla?) if they would keep our luggage after check out for the day and she said it was no problem and it would be locked up until we returned. Fantastic. This was a big help and a huge relief. \\n\\nOne more thing...we never heard a sound from the other rooms or even in the hallways.\\n\\nIf you want a pool, a fabulous in house restaurant, and lots of room....do not go here but if you want good value in a great downtown location then this is the place for you. And I'm picky so trust me.\\",
            "We had a great experience overall! Here's my summary:\\nPros: location right on Yonge St can't be beat! We were attending an NHL game and the walk was 10 minutes. Tons of pubs and restaurants all minutes away. Value; can't be beat for a hotel nestled in downtown Toronto. Decor is modern elegant meets old fashioned charm (it was built in 1909!). It was Clean! I cannot stress enough about how important that is to me! Staff were friendly for check-in\\u002Fcheck-out.\\nCons (not really cons but I'm trying to be objective here): very tiny room. We didn't much care though since we were literally just sleeping there and leaving the next day. The hotel does not have parking available. The place they recommend is 10 minutes away (but affordable). The building is very old so 'soundproofing' is non-existent. Not much can be done about that. \\nI would stay here again, hands down",
            "Stayed here for a night while attending a concert nearby. Location itself is central & close to entertainment & restaurants. We were fortunate to have good weather and were able to walk everywhere. Reception staff were great. Our room itself was comfortable, clean & bigger than I expected for a boutique hotel. The decor is modern. My only complaint would be the noise from early morning street traffic below which I\\u2019m sure is typical for downtown Toronto. I would stay here again.",
            "The Hotel Victoria is perfectly located on Yonge Street, one half block from a subway station, ten minutes walk from Union Station, and within walking distance of the best Toronto has to offer.  If you are looking for more than location, however, you will be disappointed.  The clean, comfortable rooms are small, (approx. fifteen feet square with ten foot ceilings) with an adequate bathroom.  There is only one small elevator.  We paid approximately $375 for three nights, with an additional $47 to park our car in a nearby garage.  If you are into pools and spas and pampering or are traveling with children, this is definitely not what you're looking for.  If, however, your goal is to blend into the city and explore, you'll be very pleased.\\",
            "Will definitely come back and stay again! Located in Toronto's city center, subway station is in 2 mins away. Although this is a over 100 years historical hotel, but you can merely find it old. The water pressure is great, no pipe noise and with decent room rate. Recommend to young travelers who want to explore this charming city in a convenient way",
            "My boyfriend & I stayed for two nights to attend the Muse concert at the Air Canada Center. It was a last minute reservation and I hadn't been in Toronto for years, so I went quickly through some reviews online to find a good spot downtown. The hotel is at very short walking distance of the subway, Union train & bus station, many restaurants and cafes, Eaton Station (10 min), CN tower... But most of all, it offers you this quick access to all the attractions without the boredom of a chain hotel. The lobby itself is quite beautiful, and the room we booked was cool-looking and very clean. We both agreed it was the most confortable bed we ever slept in! The only downside for me was the Wi-Fi connection: while it was free, it was very (very!) slow, and we were located on the third floor. Also, Yonge St. does get noisy even late a night, but nothing earplugs can't deal with. \\n\\nI would definitely stay there again",
            "This is a budget friendly hotel near to all major attractions in Toronto. You can even walk to all point of interest from this place. Price is basically affordable. Rooms are small but cute. If you\\u2019re not choosy about size this works for people on budget. They have a small lobby and a famous restaurant where they served good food at a low price. Staffs are very good and friendly. They are not too strict on check out time, and you are allowed to leave your luggage with them",
            "We flew into Toronto and took the public transport from the Airport to the Hotel - you end up on the subway and you can get off near enough to the hotel to wheel your bags no problem. Its simple and v cheap.  We left Toronto after 2 nights by train and walked to the station from the Hotel - we are fit and able and suitcases are on wheels but it was an easy flat walk.  The room was excellent, lovely big comfortable bed, fab sheets and all very clean. The room had a small fridge and coffee machine, old but ok a\\u002Fc, good bathroom and huge closet with iron and board.  There is a great restaurant a few doors down from the Hotel called Marche.  It serves every type of food and drink you could wish for at any time of the day. Its also opposite an Irish Bar.  I booked a king sized deluxe bedroom in advance, we got a room on the top floor with king sized bed and it looked like the top floor was finished!!!  Other floors look like works was still ongoing.  Being high up the city noise and buzz was not a problem but don't expect a view.  We walked everywhere in the city from the Hotel, it really is well situated - staff were friendly and helpful, they booked us a table for supper at CNN tower without a problem",
            "The location of this hotel in downtown Toronto can't be beat.  There are stores and restaurants and museums all around, and of course, the Lake isn't far.  We were pleasantly surprised by how quiet our rooms were.  (We stayed in two different rooms on two separate stays.)  We didn't hear noise from adjacent rooms or the street.  And the hotel is right on the Yonge street subway line.  The rooms were perfectly clean.  Many reviews of this hotel mention poor lighting in the rooms.  The hotel must have added lamps recently because, with the lamps and the overhead light turned on, the lighting was certainly adequate.  The front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful.  But there were some drawbacks.  The rooms are very small, and they don't include a chair.  Neither of our rooms had a real chair, although the second one had a low leather stool.  Not comfortable for sitting on.  There's no fridge or microwave in the rooms.  Also, there was no closet in either room.  There was a metal rod about 12 inches long in a corner, with a few hangers on it.  If you travel with a lot of clothes that you like to hang up, this hotel is not for you.  The view out the window in both rooms was of a brick wall.  Don't go to this hotel expecting views of downtown Toronto or the Lake.  The elevator is very slow.  And there was no restaurant or snack shop in the hotel, so we had to go out every morning for breakfast.  But there are plenty of places for breakfast within a few blocks.  All in all, the drawbacks are minor if you're going to Toronto to see the sights.  Just be prepared for the limitations.",
            "The location in Old Toronto is great. Within walking distance to the water.\\nThe hotel itself appeared nice online but was very different on arrival. \\nNo shuttle to or from the airport. The shower in the room had a large gap in the wall that was unfinished with tile or grout. Seemed like a good place to grow mold. \\nRequested a different room and was moved to another floor with a room that had a broken air conditioner.  Moved again to a 3rd room. The rooms were very small. The room had no full length mirror. The towel rack fell off of the wall when I picked up the towel. There is only 1 ice machine in the entire building and it is in the basement of the hotel.\\nThe staff was very friendly and tried to be accommodating, but this place is kind of a wreck.  \\nI will be back to Toronto, but will find better options in the future",
            "Having stayed in a dozen Toronto hotels on business over the years, this one was certainly the worst. I was charged $500 for an extremely modest room - tiny, outdated and uncomfortable bed, glitchy TV and a small window overlooking a brick wall. The room was inadequate, but the real problem is the price point - I was charged $500 which is obscene. When I asked if there may have been a price error, I was told that it included free water (!) and bath gowns.\\nThe hotel advertises itself as a \\\"boutique hotel\\\" which is very misleading - it has none of the charm, services, amenities or quality one would associate with that category. The hotel has no lobby or restaurant",
            "The staff here were all attentive and sincere in their services. I loved the sense of history and the blend of old and new in the interiors. The room of course was smaller than new hotels but very functional. I mentioned to staff the lighting could be a bit brighter. The location in Old Toronto is excellent being a few steps from King Subway station",
            "I usually book my hotel reservations on line. I choose the location then read some of the reviews and look at the pictures of the rooms and facilities. This is one of those few times that when I entered the room, it looked exactly like the picture on line.Of course I was very pleased. I loved that they had wooden floors and had those sofas at the foot of the bed. The room was clean and fresh. i reserved for a queen room with two queen beds like I usually do but the space in this room was much larger than the past ones I have been to.\\nNo restaurant in the hotel, but I did not mind because it was at the center of downtown Toronto and we planned to dine out. I would highly recommend this place. Slept like a baby and very satisfied customer",
            "Advertised as a boutique hotel, Victoria Hotel delivers on its promises. First, the location is terrific.  Just about 3 blocks from the train station, 1 block from subway and streetcar, near many restaurants, it makes a great base for anyone spending any amount of time in Toronto.\\n\\nOur room was small,  but that was expected. Because it is a heritage building jammed between two new buildings, most of the rooms do not have windows (\\\"fake windows\\\" with a bit of light). If you need a \\\"real\\\" window, you'll need to book a room in the front overlooking Younge Street (probably more expensive).  The room had everything we needed, although the A\\u002FC unit was quite noisy.\\n\\nStaff was friendly and helpful.  All amenities in the rooms. Note that there was no porter to help with the luggage ... not an issue for us.\\n\\nGREAT choice for downtown .... the amenities without breaking the bank",
            "My main requirements for a hotel are nice decor and cleanliness, and the hotel delivered on both counts. I had a standard queen room for three nights on the seventh floor (room 707). I'm a bit paranoid about bed bugs, so I examined the sheets, mattress, duvet, pillows, etc. when I first arrived, and it was all perfectly spotless. In fact, the whole room was spotless, and it was cleaned nicely each day while I was out. I have (over)sleeping issues, so on the second night, I hung the \\\"do not disturb\\\" sign on my door and slept in till about 2:00pm. No one bothered me, and when I came back to the room at night, it had been cleaned. My compliments to the cleaning staff!\\n\\nThe location of the hotel couldn't be better: it's a couple blocks from Union Station, and right in the  middle of the Financial District\\u002FOld Toronto (so lots of gorgeous architecture nearby). There's an entrance to the subway about a block up Yonge Street, many fast food restaurants, coffee shops, and restaurants very close by, and the Eaton Centre is a short walk away. \\n\\nThe bed was extremely comfortable (as everyone seems to agree), the decor was tasteful, there was plenty of lighting, you could adjust the temperature in your room, and the window opened, so you could get some outside air. The shower head had excellent pressure. I liked that the floors were not carpeted - it's more modern and to me, seems cleaner. Only thing is - the hotel's website says the floors are hardwood, but I'm pretty sure they're laminate. In any case, they're nice. The tv was right across from the foot of the bed, and had cable. There was no bathtub, which wasn't a problem for me as I wouldn't have used it anyway - I only point this out because I notice the website says that standard queen rooms have \\\"spacious bathtubs,\\\" which my room didn't have.\\n\\nThe only thing I would change (and I imagine the hotel wants to change as well) is that there is a little space between the glass shower door and the little retaining wall that is supposed to keep the water within the shower unit, meaning there is usually some overspill of water onto the bathroom floor. It wasn't a big deal to me, as I just put a towel there to collect the overspill, but I think it's damaging the wall below the shower over time. \\n\\nIn response to the typical complaints of those who gave the hotel two stars or less, their complaints tend to centre around these areas, which I will respond to so readers can make informed decisions:\\n1) Parking. If you're driving to the hotel, this could be an issue for you if you're not prepared to walk a bit. I took the train, so there was no problem. I wouldn't want to drive in Toronto anyway.\\n2) Lack of bars\\u002Frestaurants\\u002Froom service\\u002Fetc. In my case, I never take advantage of those amenities anyway. I think it's much more interesting to get out of a hotel and explore the city, go to a different place for breakfast each morning, observe the locals, etc. If room service and a mini bar are important to you, keep in mind that this hotel doesn't have them. I believe it does have an onsite breakfast and lunch restaurant, but I didn't go to it, so I can't review it.\\n3) Views from your hotel room window. I'm sure some rooms have views, but my room had a view of the grey brick wall of the building next door. This didn't bother me at all, because I know what the city looks like, so I don't really need to see it while in my room. Also, it means I never had to shut the blinds. If you want more natural light while in your room, you might want to consider requesting a room that doesn't face a wall. There's quite enough lighting in the room otherwise.\\n4) The shower unit was not large, which was not a problem for me, as I'm not very big, but I imagine if you were a larger person width-wise, you might feel crowded. But I only had a standard room - perhaps bigger rooms have bigger bathrooms. \\n5) Noise from the street. I had a room facing a brick wall on the 7th floor. With the window shut, there was no noise at all. With the window open, you'd occasionally hear a honk from a car, people shouting, and so forth. However, I have a tip for travellers ANYWHERE - bring a pair of foam drugstore earplugs! Then street noise\\u002Fnoise on planes or trains won't bother you at all! \\n6) Unfriendliness of staff. I didn't find any evidence that the staff was unfriendly at all. I met what appeared to be a maintenance guy in the elevator, and he even asked me how I was enjoying my stay. I found the front desk people friendly enough. Probably it depends on what mood you catch people in. I never had any problems to address with them, so I wasn't in a bad mood myself.\\n\\nOverall, I would say that if you're a traveller who regards a hotel as mostly a place you retire to at night for sleep (and want to be clean, comfortable, and modern), then you'll love this hotel. If you regard the hotel itself as your holiday, you might want to look elsewhere (because there's no room service). \\n\\nAlso, I believe the hotel was quite recently renovated, so keep this in mind when reading older reviews, because their negatives are probably no longer applicable",
            "I've stayed at many hotels in Toronto on business trips that I pay for myself. So I was happy to have everything I needed, no creepy carpet or bedspreads in this spare room with free wi-fi. This is a no frills hotel. This hotel does not provide room service meals or in house restaurant, It is close to good restaurants though. My room had no view but it did have a window so I could let in air and light. You can pay extra if you want pay per view movies, otherwise, you get basic cable which is fine for daily news. It is close to the subway and major streetcars, right downtown so many destinations are walkable.\\nThere is a breakfast restaurant with standard breakfast fare and bad coffee. Convenient if you're not fussy.\\nMy room did have an annoying design flaw in the tiny bathroom, allowing the shower to leak all over the floor, needing many towels to mop up after.\\nStaff was friendly",
            "My sister and I were looking for a cheap, decent hotel in downtown Toronto that would be close to all of the major attractions and public transportation.  For the price (compared to other hotels downtown), I was expecting this hotel to be strictly budget.  It far exceeded my expectations.  It's recently remodeled and it shows.  For $144, we got a deluxe queen room with a mini fridge.  The room was extremely clean and very chic.  The view wasn't the greatest (the windows were dirty) but there wasn't much to see except the stores across the street.  It was very quiet and a great place to crash after hectic days of sightseeing (we stayed for three nights). \\n\\nYou won't get an incredible view like some of the hotels downtown, parking is a pain (I suggest relying on public transportation if you stay here), and there is no pool or exercise room.  It was, however, an extremely good deal for the price, clean, cute, and up-to-date.  The location cannot be beat (you can walk to the lake, the CN tower is a quick streetcar ride away, and the King subway station is a short walk up the street).  I honestly cannot imagine staying anywhere else if I ever visited Toronto agai"

            "We stayed here after our wedding before going home to Etobicoke, and I am so happy that we did! We arrived late (about 1am?) and the concierge was there to greet us and take a breakfast order. The room was well-appointed - beautiful furniture, gorgeous lighting, a patio overlooking the courtyard.  The bed was easily the most comfortable I've ever slept on in my life. And the bathroom! HUGE tub, heavenly salts, separate toilet and shower stalls... just to die for. Breakfast was juice, coffee\\u002Ftea, pastries, yogurt & fruit -- and was waiting on a tray for us in the lobby area which also had a nice bar to choose from (though we weren't in the mood to take advantage of it seeing as it was 9am). I would recommend this place to everyone",
            "Not only our favorite place in Toronto, the Ivy at Verity is one of the nicest and most perfects hotels we have ever stayed at.  My mom and I, who take a trip every year, enjoyed the spacious and intricately decorated Room # 3.  Everything was spotless, comfortable, and beautiful.  Every detail of this \\\"hotel\\\" (more like an oasis) was designed and thought through.  I oftentimes found myself wanting to return to the Ivy and other areas of Verity (Sweetgrass Spa, Member's lounge, Library, Computer area) to lounge in the chairs, hang out on the room's large private patio, have a drink at the private honor bar, or take a dip in the pool or bath (prepared with salts and tea preparations).  The concierge was available 24hrs and extremely kind and helpful in accommodating any of our needs or desires, altering our daily delivered breakfasts, making reservations and offering suggestions catered to our likes, and personally introducing us to the host at George Restaurant before our reservation.  We cannot say enough good things about the Ivy\\u002FVerity\\u002FSweetgrass Spa, where you can find every amenity at high quality, spectacular service, and a beautiful ambience.  It is private but alive, and suited for a getaway, for business, and for romance.  With an entrance through Verity, as well as a private entrance (with secure coded door) for the rooms, a guest can customize his\\u002Fher stay.  The location was central to many places such as a few blocks from the subway, or a walk to St. Lawrence Market\\u002FDundas.  We cannot wait to return and could have enjoyed many more days at the Ivy at Verity!  Thank you for a wonderful experience",
            "The rooms at the Ivy are so beautiful, you really don't want to leave them.  Save time to enjoy the spa like bath, with an assortment of scented salts and heated floors - enjoy a drink or breakfast on the balcony overlooking the secluded patio of the George restaurant - and make sure you get your full eight hours sleep in the heavenly beds - amazing comfort and luxury.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, each one with a different interior design, and unlike anything you would get at a large chain hotel.  Within walking distance of downtown Toronto, the Ivy is conveniently located albeit off the beaten path.  We liked being able to enjoy a bottle of champagne in the seating area outside the rooms as a group - almost like being in your own home - before heading downstairs to the wonderful George restaurant. Personal and knowledgable concierge staff - access to Internet and computers - on site spa - and ambience from the exclusive Verity Women's Club.  I have stayed at the Ivy many times, and already am looking forward to my next visit",
            "We always like to stay in what we call small luxury hotels or special places. The Ivy is both. In the hart of a former chocolate factory you find a hotel space that is very special. Great design, fine materials, very quiet airco, fine linen, great shower, lots of space for your clothes and bags. And breakfast is served in your room! At 08.00 it is outside your door, get it in and enjoy all you ordered the evening before. Very nice and helpful staff",
            "This is a hotel within a women-only club, so only females have access to the pool, spa and gym.  The rooms are great, and service is excellent, so I didn't mind staying in the room or walking in the neighborhood while my wife enjoyed the facilitie",
            "We stayed at the Ivy for the weekend of our wedding. I had a few services at the Sweetgrass Spa and We had an amazing dinner at George the night before and then prep rooms and photos on the grounds on the day of. The rooms are stunning and the staff was spectacular and helped make the weekend everything one could hope for! We'll definitely be coming back on anniversaries to come",
            "My wife & I stayed 1 night after dropping our daughter off at the airport.  I booked the hotel & knew that it was locate in a women's club.  I didn't think that this would be an issue but as a man, I never felt completely comfortable there.  Basically, I was an interloper, not able to use the gym, massage must be in-room, etc.  The room itself was very nice. It was very large and very open, not what I would call cozy or relaxing.  We also ran into an issue with the television.  Basically, it didn't work.  After much trying the young woman at the desk got it reconnected but we were never able to access HBO which is what my wife was hoping for.  Breakfast was not bad but was not particularly filling.  All in all, not a bad stay but not one that I'd repeat, particularly give  the cost",
            "We stayed here for an evening and had dinner at George restaurant.  What a fabulous experience.  If you are travelling to Toronto, it is walking distance to the financial district, Yonge Street, the Eaton Center shopping mall and great restaurants.  The room was sooo cozy, heated flooring, spacious bathrooms with various scented bath salts, contemporary design.  The breakfast in the morning was right outside the door and we enjoyed eatting in bed.  Dinner at George was AMAZING.  The food, the service were top notch.  I highly recommend it.  There are only a few rooms, each one is decorated differently.  The spa though is women only, so sorry guys. If you are looking for a boutique hotel that is cozy, in a great location and can splurge, Verity is for you",
            "The Ivy is a hidden gem in the centre of Toronto.  Spacious beautifully decorated rooms, luxurious linens and the bathrooms are stocked with the best toiletries - a deep bath and separate shower stall.  You  feel pampered and regenerated.  Great dinner package options at George restaurant and spa options at the spa. Small and personal - treat yourself",
            "I stayed at the Ivy in November and it was wonderful! The room we stayed in was beautifully decorated and so serene. I especially love the bathroom, and the special touch of the bath salts \\\"buffet\\\". After a night out at the nearby distillery district, we enjoyed decadent desserts from George in the comfort of our room. The service was great. This was my 3rd time at Ivy and I expect I will return again",
            "Stayed in room #4 for one night. Concierge was so accommodating- helped with parking and showing us all the ammenities. \\nThe room was spacious and beautiful. Large patio. Complimentary bath salt bar over the spa tub, separate stand up shower and toilet rooms. \\nThe hotel also had a bar for guests in a small sitting area outside the room. It worked based on the honesty system- each drink you had you recorded and were charged 6$\\u002Falcoholic beverage at the end of your stay. They had wine, beer, and all sorts of hard liquor + mix. \\nThere was a complimentary continental breakfast waiting on a table outside your room starting at 715- and when you were ready you called the concierge to bring a pot of fresh coffee. \\nOverall lovely, romantic spot. We also purchased the 4 course tasting menu at George which was amazing. Will return!",
            "This is a really great hotel.  Only 4 rooms but all are super lovely.  The size room is fantastic.  It's beautifully decorated and the bed is truly amazing (I'll be buying a Hastens bed one day!).  Other benefits of staying there are access to Verity club sitting area, access to George's food (the restaurant) via room service and walking down to Sweetgrass spa in your bathrobe.  Staff are super nice as well.  A few things to be aware of....this area is pretty quiet on Sundays.  It's really, really hard to find a place to find lunch (nothing is available from IVY as well as George is closed).  Don't depend on the complimentary breakfast to get your morning started.  The baked goods are OK to bland and there are too many fruit flies flying around the other things (fruit salad, orange juice) to make them appetizing.  That's fine if it's a weekday - as you can step out and go next door to the cafe.  But on Sunday, you're a bit stuck for options.   That said - I can still look pass these small issues and enjoy my stay there!  Worth considering the next time your in Toronto",
            "Got a chance to stay at Ivy in colourful Room 3 (each of the 4 rooms is different in size or decor) on a Saturday night.  Pure bliss!  Huge bathroom with separate room for the toilet and separate large shower stall and huge soaker tub with choice of scented bath salts.  High-end Hastens bed, swivel wall-mounted flat screen large TV, desk, 2 upholstered chairs, overstuffed armchair, ottoman, actual balcony facing peaceful courtyard (over George restaurant), and complimentary continental breakfast (coffee ready to order) and honour bar (several full-size bottles but no gin; two kinds of wine and assorted beers kept on ice) available just outside the room for in-room enjoyment.  \\n\\nBeing a Saturday\\u002FSunday, the business centre\\u002Flibrary area of the private women's club upstairs was empty and the concierge said I could use it.  Although the gorgeous basement-level pool, hot tub, and spa area is women-only, I still recommend this place to couples if the man can skip that part.  We got the urban one-night getaway package, so a 4 course tasting menu at George was included.  The service at George was a little rough -- we weren't offered any upgrades or wine pairings and the amuse bouche and first two courses came out too quickly --  we hadn't even received our aperitif cocktails yet!\\n\\nIvy is significantly cheaper than staying at Hazelton but now that I've stayed overnight at both, I would choose Ivy again and again.  The only difference is the slightly smaller closet space at Ivy compared to the two-sided closet\\u002Fstorage area in Hazelton rooms, and the lack of a TV in the bathroom at Ivy.  Otherwise the room setup and comfort quality is the same.  Ivy provides Bulgari white tea scented toiletries along with the choice of 3 scented bath salts.  Hazelton provides a fridge in-room stocked only with wine products and teas whereas Ivy gives many choices just outside the room and a free breakfast (Ivy continental included 2 kinds of croissants, jam, apple strudel slices, an interesting coconut oatmeal porridge that tasted great at room temperature, fresh berry fruit salad, choice of orange or grapefruit juice, and hot tea or coffee on demand.)  Yes, Hazelton does room service and has a restaurant open for brunch on site, whereas George at Ivy does not provide that flexibility.  The indoor pool at Hazelton was a huge disappointment (no windows, awful lighting and no relaxation area around the pool) whereas the women-only pool at Ivy is lovely and even has an underwater treadmill!  Queen Street East between Church and Jarvis is no Yorkville.  But for $200+ less on average per night, Ivy offers better value at a similar standard",
            "My husband and I received an 'Urban Retreat' package as a wedding gift, and were blown away by this hotel and The George Restaurant when we finally got around to booking and coming for a little getaway.\\nThe service was phenomenal (front desk, spa and George restaurant!), the food amazing, the room gorgeous and unique.. so many little details were attended to. We are definitely going to give this as a gift to a family member who is getting married in the fall.\\n*the only tiny thing I'd say that could be improved is the coffee they served us in the morning. It tasted sort of musty and wasn't very warm",
            "Had a girl trip July 7th thru July11th and had picked The Ivy at Verity.  So glad we did!  It was wonderful.  Couldn't hardly get out of bed in the morning because the bed was like sleeping on a cloud!  The breakfast was amazing.  Fresh croissants and banana bread, fruit and yogurt. The pool area was beautiful and relaxing.  The highlight was George, our concierge, who was too wonderful for words!  He was so helpful with helping plan our day and making suggestions for us.  He found out we loved iced tea, so always had it ready for us at any time of the day.  He booked our day trip to Niagra Falls, which was wonderful.  We didn't want to leave!  I would never want to stay anyplace else in Toronto.  Loved it, loved it!  Miss you now, George!!  You made our trip the best",
            "We live in Toronto, but I surprised my husband with  here for one night on our wedding anniversary in April 2014.  He had no idea there were even rooms at the Verity and was excited (perhaps unnecessarily) that we were visiting a \\\"ladies club\\\" for our anniversary, ha ha. Our experience was so positive from start to finish. It's such a little gem. Our room rivalled any hotel room we've been to around the world--gorgeous huge bathroom, comfy beds, beautiful amenties. The honour bar was lovely too, so quaint. Staff were excellent..rooms were beautifully maintained, well cleaned, front desk staff was attentive etc. My husband had in in room massage and I had a manicure downstiars--the BEST it lasted for over a week!)--plus one of the ladies gave me a make up lesson at the fun\\u002Finteractive make up bar. Spa is really lovely.  Then we had a great dinner at George (food was out of this world although the waiter was a bit haughty). Overall I would highly recommend the Ivy and the package we had. A great escape in the city",
            "Exceptional and almost up there with the fastiduously superb hotel 41 in London, or, a favourite, the Charlotte St hotel in Fitzrovia, London. We stayed 2 nights for an anniversary and the staff could not have done more to help make our stay a wonderful experience. Unfortunately the affiliated Georges restaurant was shut the evenings we stayed (Sun\\u002FMon) but we were recomended a superb local steak house (Berberians) and the Georges Lunch on Monday was excellent. \\n\\nOverall a really fabulous stay and our only suggestions would be to put some cheap pens or pencils in the room to note down stuff without having to rummage through the executive carrier bags!\\n\\nOverall a rare gem, but we did feel that it needs to communicate a clear proposition; as a fabulous boutique hotel, a fine dining experience, a club,a ladies health spa, or,  all 4",
            "We stayed at the Ivy for one night -- our honeymoon -- and it was fantastic. It is truly an oasis in the heart of downtown Toronto and you will be pampered! The beds are so plush, you will not want to get out of bed. We especially enjoyed the very spacious and stylish bathrooms, especially the very large and lovely soaking tub and showers. Can't wait to go back",
            "We live in Toronto and were celebrating- my birthday, my husbands birthday and my best friend's and her husband's birthday all fall within a month of each other, so we decided this year to celebrate in style- a night at the Ivy. We kicked things off first at the Sweetgrass spa (for women only) then enjoyed a 10 course tasting menu on George's beautiful courtyard patio.\\n \\nGoing with another couple allowed me to gawk at their room too (room #1). I love how this hotel has only four rooms and all are tasteful and elegant, and so different. Our room (#3) was a glamorous blend of modern mixed with classic timeless materials, a nod to their chocolate factory past. Gorgeous blue wallpaper is charming against the relic brick of a bygone era. The rooms themselves are massive, much roomier than any other downtown hotel I've seen. With different seating areas to recline and relax, including a sunny deck that faces George's patio, my husband and I loved every minute of our stay. The bathroom has a super deep soaker tub and inviting aromatic bath salts- they have clearly anticipated your every thought! \\nOne feature I loved was the Samsung tablet that you use to control the television, but also acts as a portable TV, which they have linked to Netflix...cue the Orange is the New Black marathon! \\n\\nMy bestie's room was an intimate portrait of a Parisian hotel, soft pink striped wallpaper was welcoming and warm. Her room was every bit as luxurious as mine, every detail carefully constructed. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back, absolutely adore the staff, spa and restaurant here. It's a rare gem in a city full of over-done, over hyped hotels (IMHO). Nice gestures like the honour bar and delicious complimentary breakfast are just the finishing touches to a spoiled brat weekend. Thanks Ivy",

            "Strange setting, 4 room hotel inside a women's only networking club in central Toronto.\\nSet in a beautifully renovated industrial complex, the room was a treat to the senses, salts for the bath, special wood floors in the bathroom. Everything about the room was perfect. We also had a beautiful little terrace overlooking a courtyard where we had breakfast.\\nThe affiliated George restaurant was also magnificent, and all the staff was attentive and knowledgable.\\nI loved the place.\\nI'll definitely go back",
            "I absolutely love the Ivy Hotel and have stayed there several times.  It is a perfect retreat for a romantic get away with your partner and there are several packages available which include dinner at the hotel's George Restaurant.   I have also used the Ivy when having a girls' day with my sister, niece and mom at the adjacent Sweetgrass Spa and an evening out so the room was nice to come back to.   In addition, I have used the Ivy for business purposes if I book a corporate dinner at George or have meetings downtown the next day, the Ivy is conveniently situated in the downtown core.   The 4 room boutique hotel is luxurious and cozy with a unique ambience.  The staff and service is attentive. I am already looking forward to my next stay",
            "Who knew that I could travel a half hour from home and feel like I was in Paris?! We had a lovely stay at the Ivy for a 1-night getaway in the city. \\n\\nI can't compliment the hotel and it's staff enough. First and foremost was the European-inspired decor of this chic little boutique hotel - just stunning. With only 4 rooms, it's intimate and cozy, but doesn't feel 'small'.  \\n\\nWonderful spa, library and lounge area. The hotel rooms are excellent -  no detail spared. The walkout to the terrace was a nice surprise. \\n\\nThe 'honesty bar' in the sitting room down the hall was a personalized touch. \\n\\nWill definitely be back",
            "Spent a wonderful weekend in Toronto at The Ivy at Verity.  A boutique hotel with just 4 rooms. Our was beautifully decorated, spacious with an amazing bathroom.   They have thought of everything -- honor bar, round the clock concierge and unique touches like freshly brewed tea to enjoy while you soak in a huge tub soaking in specially chosen bath salts.   It was a truly magical experience.   Can't imagine every staying anywhere else in Toronto.   Book ahead so you won't miss out",
            "All senses on board at this super LUX haven for anyone needing to regroup, get centred, celebrate - remember why you don\\u2019t hate your loved ones (haha).  Thank you to all staff members - George (concierge), Melissa (spa), Courtney(George restaurant) - just to name a few.

            "We absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was so welcoming and helpful. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was perfect. \\nThis hotel is owned by the women's club and was originally used exclusively by the club for when they had guests in town. Now anyone can book a room if you are lucky enough to nab one. There are only four rooms in the entire hotel and they are separated away from the rest of the club so it is very quiet. The rooms are very large with a king bed and beautiful full wall windows with a door onto a private balcony. Each room is color coded and unique. the bathroom comes with heated floors, a separate room for the toilet, an amazing shower, and the largest bath tub I have ever seen. I am 6'2\\\" and I could stretch out in the tub with room to spare. The added bonus is the in house made bath salt that they provide in three different scents.\\nYou also get breakfast delivered to your door. It is not a large meal but it gets you through to lunch. \\nThe last thing I have to say is that you MUST have dinner at George while you are there. This restaurant specializes in tasting menus for all dietary plans. The biggest benefit is that after your three hour multi -course meal you just have to walk up the hidden staircase to your room (never leaving the building). \\nI will definitely stay here again if ever back in Toronto",
            "Amazing getaway in the heart of Toronto.  Great location, only four rooms in the entire hotel, gorgeous boardrooms, library, balconies.  The hotel rooms are enormous, luxurious, romantic and spotless.  The spa downstairs is just for women (which was kind of wonderful) but the male half of a couple might feel a little left out.  Then he should remind himself that he gets paid more than his wife does to do the same job\\u2026 and go relax in the giant bathtub instead",
            "We just spent one blissful night at The Ivy at Verity. Could have stayed longer but the hotel was fully booked for the rest of the week. However, even the one night was enough for us to enjoy the wonderful surprises that this hotel offers. This place is a piece of heaven, when you enter the hotel through the Club \\\"Verity\\\" you are transported into another dimension, where your every wish is fulfilled. Our room was tasteful as it was beautiful, colors that soothe, bed linens that feel like \\\"cloud 9\\\", nothing missing or lacking. Best of all, we get to use the facilities of Verity's Sweetgrass Spa, and wine & dine at \\\"George\\\" Verity's 5-star restaurant, all under the same roof. After one night I am refreshed and rejuvenated, as if I spent a week at a resort. A place like this is hard to find, lucky for me I found it. Can't wait to return",
            "Great hotel, unique experience. Highly recommended. George Restaurant was also amazing. Friendly staff, good breakfast and complimentary drinks all day. We also liked the spa, which is for women only. A bit weird neighborhood, but quite close to everything",
            "Definitely not your usual hotel. Looking for a home away your home.....This is the place where to go when you are in Toronto. Even if not located in some fancy neighborhoods, this place is a gem. At first a \\\"Women's club\\\" , the Ivy offers some rooms now... Mine was .. Yes ... awesome. A large room with a large bed, a pretty big bathroom with for the first time ever of my life a bath salt \\\"bar\\\" ... Breakfast it serve at your door at the requested time. Might be a little bit light (missing some toasts and butter), ordered croissants and chocolate brioche and ends-up with a muffin with grapes   ... But this was good.\\nTeam is great ... I will highly recommend this place ... Especially if you are a woman ... Next time i will try the SPA",
            "My husband and I had a delightful stay at your hotel!  \\n\\nWe had never stayed in a boutique hotel before, and were really impressed by how quiet it was, and the attention to detail our room presented.\\n\\nWe frequently stopped and smelled the fresh roses in our room, and throughout the hotel.  Beautiful!  My husband celebrated the first bath he\\u2019s taken (as an adult), and actually been able to submerse under the water.  He tried each of the epsom salts, and enjoyed each, (I made the mistake of trying the rosemary the first day, and then didn\\u2019t want to try anything else).  I think he\\u2019s considering a bathroom reno after our stay!  The heated floor was a lovely touch, and the shower was quite roomy.  \\n\\nEach day we woke up, one of our first comments was we loved the bed.  We actually visited the Hasten\\u2019s store, and bought one to take home.  I was amazed the salesman, Nicholas, knew what firmness of bed we were sleeping on by our room number.  Wow.  We thought the sheets and pillows were awesome too, (but we would have appreciated trying the Hasten\\u2019s one to know if we should have bought them too!).  I was surprised to learn we were sleeping on a ten year old bed, because it was so cosy and supportive.  I can\\u2019t wait for ours to arrive!\\n\\nI took advantage of the spa and club.  The ladies were welcoming, professional, and eager to please!  Leada, the beautician, was very skilled and helpful.  My nails still look great!\\n\\nWe dined on the 5 course tasters menu at the George restaurant.  It was easily the best meal I\\u2019ve every eaten.  Each course was a delight, (gorgeous and fragrant), and it was an evening\\u2019s entertainment to hear about the wines and food.  Ian, our waiter, was attentive, personable, and knowledgable. \\n\\nThe concierge was usually the young woman (I apologize for not getting her name).  You both were lovely!  While probably not your most demanding clients, we sure enjoyed the hot coffee and tea brought to our room whenever we called, and the quiet determination to make every detail (such as the spa products I liked delivered to my room) perfect!  The continental breakfast and trailmix were delicious!\\n\\nI\\u2019ve already recommended your lovely hotel to others!  I hope there are still rooms available when we next book, we can\\u2019t wait to come back",
            "My husband had an in- room massage, I relaxed in the spa, before our wonderful dinner at George. Back in our luxurious room, later that evening, we enjoyed a brandy and watched a light snow falling on our terrace.  A magical birthday getaway. Can't wait to go back",
            "I found the Ivy on hotels.com. Thought it sounded unique and it is! Four gorgeously and differently appointed rooms. Huge bathroom with rain shower and deep soaking tub, including in-house-made, complimentary bath salts - a nice touch after a long day of walking. There is an honor bar with white wine, liquors, and soft drinks. Also tea bags and instant coffee. Continental breakfast is included and it is quite ample - yogurt\\u002Fgranola, boiled egg, croissant or muffin, juices, and coffee\\u002Fcream. Really nice.\\n\\nThe only difficulty that I encountered was a previously unannounced electricity outage one night from 10pm to 4am the following morning. WEIRD. A letter left in my room. No explanation. Battery lantern and flashlight provided. \\n\\nThe building is in a sort of run-down block of Queen St just a bit east of the better parts of Queen St West. But I did not feel unsafe. \\n\\nThere is a great women's clothing store a few doors down. Don't miss it! And an excellent antiques store in the the next block east. Plenty of good restaurants a block or two away as well as the upscale George attached.\\n\\nLovely subterranean swimming pool and hot tub. And a spa",
            "We chose the Ivy's Urban Retreat package for one night as a way to celebrate our anniversary in Toronto. In the city, there are no shortage of luxury hotel options, but it can be difficult to find a place to stay that is really in the \\\"boutique\\\" category while offering privacy, luxury, fun, and peace while away from home. In just about every category for evaluation, the Ivy excels. This 4-room hotel downtown stands out and above other options in Toronto, and we're thrilled to have discovered it.\\n\\nYou can request a particular room when booking, and we chose room #2. With a calming colour scheme, plenty of space, a gorgeous marble bathroom (deep tub and huge shower room!), and a large flat screen with a blu-ray player, it's well-outfitted, comfortable, and very quiet. You have access to a refreshments area with honour bar and complimentary soft drinks, as well as access to the members only lounge area, which we didn't make use of. Their packages have incredible value, and we had the chance to enjoy an included five-course meal at the onsite George restaurant and an hour long massage at the onsite Sweetgrass spa. \\n\\nTo clarify some confusion amongst the reviews and elsewhere, Verity is the parent company here and responsible for the spa and restaurant, as well as the hotel. The spa (and this includes all available fitness facilities) is women only, but this absolutely does not mean that men are somehow unwelcome. In fact, should you wish, men can request in-room spa services. As a male guest, I absolutely loved my stay here, and my partner was able to make use of the beautiful spa facilities. \\n\\nToronto seems to be a city where it can be difficult to feel as if value matches cost for accommodations. The Ivy at Verity bucks this unfortunate trend and offers an experience we hope to someday return for",
            "Love this place, love Toronto.  Been here 3x in the past year and will be returning soon.  Beautiful retreat.  Wonderful to walk downstairs to George for dinner, to the spa for a massage, or up the street to the subway to get around the city.  Staff is first rate, attentive, and respectful of my privacy. It's expensive but the price is fair",
            "This boutique hotel is exactly that. Small, but beautifully put together. Staff were all fantastic. Rooms perfect. Best bathrooms we've found in Canada, and when the weather allows a lovely veranda to sit on. Attached is a ladies health club and spa, and if I lived in Toronto I would join. Can you start one in England  - preferably near where I live \\uD83D\\uDE04 Husband and I had a champagne breakfast to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was lovely",
            "I've been staying in Marriotts, Hiltons and Holiday Inns for over 4 years with work, but it's only by coming to The Ivy that I'm reminded how good a hotel experience you can have if you go to the boutique places.\\nThe first thing is even though this is effectively 'an old boys club for women', my wife booked it for our first trip to Toronto and we both found it to be utterly beautiful, relaxing and a joy to stay in. We could happily move into room 3 and never leave, the bed and bathroom are brilliant, the honesty bar and espresso machine outside the room make you feel at home to come and go as you please, the staff were super friendly and helpful, and even though the spa is women only they allowed us in after hours. As for the George restaurant, we've never had a better tasting menu anywhere in the world. A rare foodie experience I'll not forget in a hurry.\\nOne of those places that genuinely nourishes your body and mind. Can't say enough good things about it",
            "I am amazed by just how relaxing one night in the city actually was.  \\n\\nBut the bed is lovely.  And the aqua wallpaper in #3 is soothing.  And the design, in general, is excellent.  And the bathroom is exquisite (with great soaps and the like).  And they have this nice internal lobby where there's an honour bar and a Nespresso machine, which is actually where we enjoyed our dessert from George.\\n\\nI would've loved to stay for longer (though, well, it's not exactly a cheap stay), and I would've enjoyed the possibility of a massage.  I kind of wish I could stay here more often.  Shame it's not dog-friendly, and shame that the parking isn't included.  But these are definitely minor",
            "We had an excellent time here. The massage package with the room for two can be used by one person for the full hour by a RMT therapist. The breakfast consisted of coffee, a choice of freshly squeezed juice, pastry's, fresh fruit offered on a tray outside of your room. They have a small area to sit or you can bring your tray to your room.\\nThe hallways are so confusing of how to get to your room or even how to get to the reception area, although they were very accommodating to help you find your way. It was a nice treat with the spa downstairs for the following day.\\nVery close to the Eaton Centre. A great part of the city. It truly was a welcomed treat",

So beautiful and stylish but with plenty of substance. The people are warm and helpful and the beds are Hastens so the best sleep ever acheived. There is a Verity spa (complete with hot tub, steam room, and sauna ) on property called Sweetgrass that is exclusive for women but men staying in the hotel can have treatments in their hotel room. They even have fitness facilities (again, exclusive to women)  and you can add on a yoga class if you want for a nominal fee.\\nFabulous stay, incredible bed, God is here, in the deails",

            "I wouldn't have even known this was their unless we were staying there as part of a wedding party, but it was truly a special little oasis in the city.

There was also a large patio with a table overlooking a quiet courtyard.  Never once did it sound like we were in a city.  The bathroom was also huge and had a great assortment of quality soaps including 3 different scents of bath salts.   Room included a continental breakfast.  There also was an open area outside the room with complimentary soft drinks and cocktails for fee.  Would highly recommend this quiet, gem in the city",
            "What a gem of a hotel.  Beautiful decor, impeccably maintained, and can't say enough about the most comfortable bed we've ever experienced.  The bathroom has heated floors, and the scent of homemade bathsalts (lavender, jasmine and eucalyptus) permeated through to the bedroom.  Would definitely stay there again",
            "If you like plush  guesthouses then this is for you. Big rooms, beautiful big bathroom and not far from the nicer parts of town. Extensive basics \\u002Fservices are explained to you upon arrival and so you do feel like you're in a plush guesthouse rather than a efficient luxury hotel. The mini bar and breakfast area (even for in room breakfasts) are in a small shared space. The reception is one of those low down desks hence the guesthouse\\u002F plush b&b feel. Men cannot use any of the spa facilities, not even the gym :( Great for a traveling business woman who spends a lot of time in plush hotels and wants a more the social experience you would get in a b&b\\u002Fguesthouse.",
            "A Gem in a perfect location. Where do I begin. I was greeted by a super nice and friendly staff. I was early for an appointment but interested in my wedding possibly there. I met with planner immediately who was a sweetheart. Just for any thinking about a wedding there, the prices can't be beat!  When I returned I was taken up to my room. The hotel is so lush, with velvet, satin,art work, a library and lounge. One of my favourite features is the honour bar which has inexpensive drinks, free pop, and a espresso coffee machine and tea. The best part was it was right out my bedroom door. The continental breakfast was just the right amount and delicious. The room was just WOW!  It was huge and the wonderful scent from the bath crystals was light yet a delight to the senses. The fixtures were unusual and very artsy. The bathroom was huge! Everything was soft and plush from towels, bedding and bath robes. I only had the pleasure of one night so not enough time to explore all the hotel and neighborhood had to offer. The menu was on a tablet, unlike some hotels where they are a bit used and messy. If you needed something, a friendly staff member was there quickly. I really can't say enough about this wonderful hotel and staff!  Thank you for an amazing night",
            "This hotel is part of a small, elegant upscale spa and restaurant complex and women's club. The restaurant is superior as are the spa facilities and the rooms.  Decoration is in impeccable taste in every part of the complex.  The beds are British--Hypnos is the brand.  They are ultra-luxury in price; more importantly, they make for an exceptional sleep. We had a perfect escape to an elegant oasis in the middle of Toronto in the winter.  Highly recommended",

And we are not usually a gushy family!! \\n\\nEveryone from the front desk staff to housekeeping to the folks at the restaurant\\u002Fbar (1 Kitchen is a fabulous place to eat btw - we had 2 excellent meals here) exemplified the 1Hotel brand - super friendly, positive, there to help you and ensure your stay is perfect. \\n\\nAside from the superior service level (which for me makes or breaks the vacation), the room was beautiful, the fixtures pristine, the bathroom just so beautiful. We don't typically love doorless showers when traveling with kids BUT this one was so tastefully done and in keeping with the natural, sustainable, eco-friendly theme of the hotel which we loved and appreciated that we didn't mind at all. The lobby and interior of the building was also just so gorgeous - reflecting the hotel philosophy oh-so stylishly. Gym was fantastic which both myself and my teen son frequented. \\n\\nWe left feeling so radiantly satisfied with our experience and thrilled that we have found, THE ONE, no pun intended! This will definitely be where we stay from now on, whenever we visit Toronto. We already can't wait for our next visit next summer, if not sooner",
            "I am not one to review. Normally I ignore the invites to do so but this group of individuals from 1 Hotel Toronto are absolutely awesome. My second stay, first was for business and second now for fun, I have to say I could tell the difference in how they personalize your stay. The Front Office Manager reached out to see if anything could do done to make this stay better so I was able to tell her about my wife joining. We were given a nice upgrade, a great return welcome and even the fine individuals in room service knew I was a repeat guest. I've been recognize before as a repeat traveller but this folks made it feel like home. You will know when you stay how you make a difference.\\nPros: The Staff, The Cleanliness the room, the location to queen st w, great texting service, sustainable impact\\nCons: Can be loud at night, doesn't bother me but woke up wife up a few times\\nTip: Harriets (rooftop) is not managed but the hotel but the Front Desk will try to get you in if you are a guest of the hotel. Haven't been disappointed yet. Loyalty is recognized",
            "We stayed at 1 Hotel about a month ago, celebrating a special occasion, and from the moment I spoke with Chef Derek Powers and let him know, him and his team were BEYOND accommodating. I have some dietary limitations, and he went out of his way to select items I could eat, that were all DELICIOUS. We ate at the hotel a few times during our stay, and I was so impressed by the quality of the food and service - everything was fresh and I felt good about what I was eating. We saw Chef Powers a few more times during our stay and he really went out of his way to celebrate our special weekend, and was happy to offer us recommendations that suited our dietary needs. The room was also GORGEOUS... it felt new and clean and was incredibly comfortable. I also love the focus on sustainability. I really couldn't say anything but great things about our stay. Thank you Chef Powers and the 1 Hotel team for making our weekend one to remember",
            "I liked my room very much. It\\u2019s we\\u2019ll decorated and comfortable. These days hotels are not so much a place to lay your head, but a place you can immerse yourself in, to eat, hang out, exercise and enjoy yourself. They know this too, which is why they create the ambience they do. Hotels in all sorts of places; Rio, Tokyo; London; New York, have excellent hotels that grant you some level of exclusivity that come with staying at the hotel. They have a beautiful pool deck\\u002Flounge\\u002Froof top, well if you\\u2019re a guest, you are welcome to enjoy. If not a guest, you have to wait in line and maybe get in or not. At the 1 Hotel, not the case. You do not get access to the lounge; you do not get onto the rooftop; you are the same as anyone else even though you are paying $600 a night for a room. No exclusivity. I felt like I was just a person filling a bed. Coming back from dinner, it doesn\\u2019t matter if you want to enjoy a night cap. I found this very frustrating and it did not make me feel like a valued guest",
            "We really enjoyed our friends trip to Toronto, and had an excellent time staying at the The One Hotel. The property was very clean, filled with light and I appreciated the additional attention to sustainability. The staff at the front desk was very helpful in offering recommendations for things to do and restaurants to visit. Especially Samantha",
            "I booked a suite for the night before our wedding and our wedding night. It was spacious and airy and had all the comforts of home. The kitchen had dishes and glassware and the bedroom had a portable speaker which came in handy to play music while the bridesmaids got their hair and make up done in the morning. Love the focus on sustainability (I don\\u2019t think anything was in plastic packaging or came in a plastic bottle) and recycling. The location is great and so close to transit and King West restaurants, though there\\u2019s plenty of dining options onsite as well. Would highly recommend this hotel (and we didn\\u2019t even get to use all the amenities!).",
            "We chose 1Hotel for our stay because we had stayed there a few times before. The rooms are consistently clean, beautiful, cozy. \\n\\nAs we we left our room, a few members of the housekeeping team were outside and one of them (Martha) stopped us ans asked me how to pronounce my name, I told her and she said she was assigned to clean my room during my stay, she asked if I had any preferences or needed any additional items in my room. She was so pleasant and each time we ran into her she'd greet us by our names. She always refreshed the room quite a few times without prompting so each time we entered it seemed like we were arriving for the first time. It was definitely above and beyond service. \\n\\nI downloaded the app on my last stay and added preferences and noticed that on this visit there were a few added special features like a fruit platter and a nice note on our desk when we returned to the room that was personalized to me.\\n\\nWe also had friends stay and worked with Melida, Director Front Desk, to have each guest accommodated. Two guests decided to join last minute and she made arrangements for them the day before, honouring our rate and even getting the rooms on the same floor (two of them.were right beside us). \\n\\nOverall our stay with respect to rooms and booking was fantastic",
            "No detail is spared when you stay at 1 Hotel. This is my second experience at a 1 Hotel property, and it just keeps getting better. Jonah, Shamar, and Omar at the front desk\\u002Fbell services were an incredible help to us each day. Maxine and Sabrina were wonderful in the Flora Lounge. The danish and breakfast options in Flora Lounge were fantastic. Lunch at 1 Kitchen was extra fresh and the Aperol Spritz bar was so fun. We visited the Rooftop and my goodness, the views are incredible and the ambiance is unmatched. The rooms are impeccable and their commitment to sustainability at every point in your stay is truly remarkable. How do we get more hotels to be like 1 Hotel?",
            "The room, and general atmosphere of the hotel, was serene, comfortable, and clean. The staff was very friendly and attentive, however the concierge services could have been more effective in some instances. For example, managing reservations at the restaurants within the hotel. The cleaning crew did an impeccable job tidying the room each day but room service fell short with providing requested items.  \\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay but consider this a little lacking of a typical five star experience",
            "This is a MUST stay when in Toronto.  Just walk through the front doors and you feel (and smell) the calmness in the air.  The staff is always friendly and helpful, the service throughout the hotel is top notch. Just look around and you\\u2019ll see they take sustainability seriously. Salvaged wood from locations around the city, many of which is marked with where it came from.  And the greenery throughout really adds a cozy touch.  The restaurants are great too, be sure to grab breakfast at 1Kitchen, the Avocado Tartine never disappoints.  And don\\u2019t miss Casa Madera, it\\u2019s not just a wonderful meal, it\\u2019s an experience!  Our stay at 1 Hotel never disappoints, looking forward to returning when we are back in the city",
            "It was the perfect home away from home during our stay in Toronto. The welcoming and friendly staff made our stay extremely comfortable. The rooms were super comfortable with beautiful decor with everything needed for your stay, and anything additional needed was only a phone call away. Loved the Flora lounge and rooftop pool and the gym was amazing! Thanks to our favourite staff member Zoe for going above and beyond to make sure our stay was great. We will definitely be back, thank you",
            "This hotel is more than an ordinary 5 star hotel, and offers things which you can\\u2018t buy for money. Be it the  lovely and beautifully decorated sushi at the pool deck, Neil and Myra at the front desk with great advice, Ina from housekeeping performing a really impressive and immaculate turn down service, or the pool staff always finding a way to accomodate us. \\nOur double Queen room was nice and very quiet, although we desperately missed some more hooks  (the only real improvement potential). Outstanding towel quality, nicely designed towelling robes. \\nThe hotel location is good, the bar extremely nice, the fitness area very well equipped, and the restaurant 1 kitchen ok if you want an easy meal (good food but was nearly empty in the evening\\u002F portions partly very small\\u002F not competitive vs many other restaurants in the area). \\nAll in all: I would always pick this hotel again",
            "The 1 Hotel is a perfect execution of luxury sustainability. With a full gym and classes available to experience. Great restaurants and a rooftop with a 360 view!! They also have a house car for transportation within the area, but most of the hot spots are within walking distance of the hotel",
            "Our 1 Hotel stay was exceptional!  We would like to thank Steven Dagenais who helped us get discounted corporate rates. He provided outstanding service and ensured that we were happy with all aspects of our visit!  Also, we had great assistance from Stephanie with finalizing the booking and she addressed any questions we had along the way. \\n\\nWe experienced 1 Kitchen for brunch and dinner, Flora Lounge for cocktails, Harriet's Rooftop for dinner and we also utilized room service for a meal!  The food and drinks are so fresh and delicious. We just loved all of it.\\n\\nThe rooms are so clean, unique and beautiful.  Sustainability was designed in everything from beautiful furniture, live plants everywhere and even the small items in each room.  \\n\\nThanks again to Steven, Stephanie and every single team member who were attentive, pleasant, happy and extremely quick to address all our requests!!",
            "As soon as we walked though the front door, we were immersed in a warm and tranquil environment and greeted by the most friendly and welcoming staff. Melida and her team were amazing (the bell hop, the front desk staff, the room service attendant and the servers- we wish we could remember all of their names as they all deserve an honorary mention!) They were attentive and beyond accommodating. We were so impressed by the superb quality of our stay, that we ended up staying 2 extra nights. Couldn\\u2019t be happier and definitely will be back soon :",
            "Incredible stay, not long enough!  The sustainable design, vibe and convenient location just touches the surface of an incredible experience.  Customer care and service was outstanding.  Specifically, Helena\\u2019s personable and friendly demeanor was icing on the cake post delivery of her perfect libations tailored to delicious bar bites.  Fitness facility has it all and more.  Diverse and delicious menu items in on-site restaurants will not disappoint.  Rooms are well designed, very comfortable, and fitting for a leisure and travel accolade at minimum.  Will definitely revisit 1 Hotel Toronto and others in the brand.  Absolutely awesome",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at 1 Hotel Toronto. It\\u2019s location to the water, Queen street shopping and the Stackt market was convenient. The hotel lobby and my room offered a breath of fresh air from the noise and the busyness of the city. I was warmly welcomed by several of the staff. After a long period of travel that left me dehydrated and hungry, there was fresh fruit and flavored water to enjoy while I checked in. My room was an oasis of calm. Though I was street side, the noise didn\\u2019t penetrate the space and the interior design of the room made up for the lack of a view. Everything that the hotel offered that I took advantage of was a positive experience. I borrowed a bike and the concierge provided me with a safe and easy path to the bike path that runs along the water. After a long day, I decided to order room service for dinner. There were several excellent vegan, healthy options. The carrot soup was amazing. It was delivered by an extremely friendly staff person and in a timely manner. My room was equipped with a bathtub. The hotel provided bath salts so I decided to end the evening with a bath. It was a very calm environment and perfect way to end a busy day. The bathroom has everything anyone could need. The toiletries they provide are high quality and smell amazing. The hair dryer was also of high quality. It was a Dyson. I usually travel with my own hairdryer when I check luggage because the hotel hair dryers usually fry my hair. I recently stayed at a Ritz Carlton property assuming they would have a really good dryer but they surprisingly had a super cheap one that made my hair frizzy for the whole trip. Since I was only doing a carry-on, I left my hair dryer at home and was so excited to see that the 1 Hotel stocks their rooms with such a nice hair dryer. . Never underestimate the importance of these small details. The other cool feature of this hotel is that they have Tesla house cars that can take you places in the city within a certain radius. Even though I didn\\u2019t take advantage of this, it was nice to know that it was an option.",
            "1 Hotel is probably one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in! From the furniture to the food, everything has been thought out from start to finish. The customer service team is very attentive, and the plants in the hotel add such a gorgeous, fresh touch. Highly recommend staying here",
            "When ever I travel to Toronto I typically stay at the Hazelton or the Fairmont but I decided I wanted to try something new and stay at the 1 Hotel.. and let me tell you I was not disappointed. I was blown away not only by how luxurious this eco friendly hotel is but also the exceptional service I received. I dined at Harriet's and Casa Madera and had some of the best dining experiences that I can remember. The guests service manager Kristy gave me her personal contact information and was so attentive to all of my needs. If you're looking for luxury, comfort, good food, incredible atmosphere, and phenomenal services this is the spot for you",
            "We had a spacious studio suite on the 9th floor. Initial concerns over noise from construction across the street turned out to be unwarranted.  Highlights of our stay: the hotel restaurant was superb!!  A polished hand in the kitchen that was  on par with a fine dining establishment. \\n\\nFriendly staff  both in the hotel and the restaurant and not a whiff of attitude. Location was close to Farm Boy which meant easy access to breakfast and lunch goodies bought in advance and enjoyed later without having to leave the room.  Thor coffee on the next block was a jewel.  The bedding and the beds were fantastic. And the filtered tap water was great. \\n\\nThe only downside was the bar scene along King Street a couple of blacks away, that was noisy and crowded, not conducive to a relaxing evening strol",
            "Wonderful overall experience.  Starting from the car valet, check-in, room, food, beverages, service, amenities, and location the choice could not be surpassed!  Loved the signature fragrance in the lobby, soft fluffy white towels, comfy duvet, natural wood decor, and Nespresso machine with stone cups.  The hotel staff epitomizes professionalism and warmth",
            "We came to stay at 1hotel for the weekend before Valentine's day and our experience from start to finish was absolutely comfortable, enchanting and the most wholesome couple of days imaginable. The staff went above and beyond from the entrance all the way to the hotel room. This is without even mentioning the staff at 1kitchen  Adrien, Nelson, Oscar, Julie, and Hanna had us spoiled and welcomed we couldn't help but visit the restaurant 4 times in 2 days. The kitchen staff abosultely blow us away with the food not to mention the desserts. Definitely worth the visit",
            "I was wondering if this location would live up to the Miami location and it definitely does. I am an avid traveler and a foodie, the 1 Hotel is definitely right up my alley. My girlfriend and I came to Toronto for a weekend getaway and I am SO happy we chose this spot.\\n\\nEvery single staff member, from the front desk, to the bartenders, to the pool service, to the housekeepers, EVERYONE was genuinely happy, attentive and so friendly. Making us feel right at home. \\n\\nThe food at the restaurants is absolutely delicious. Try the Bento Box up at the pool, it was the perfect lunch. Also stopped into the 1 Kitchen for a drink before dinner. The spicy marg was perfectly concocted. \\n\\nWe treated ourselves to a suite with a bathtub and it was SOOO relaxing. The perfect way to unwind after a long day. The gym was also very impressive. Literally every piece of equipment you could ever ask for. I don't usually hit the gym when I'm on vacation but I couldn't resist with the selection of clean and unique machines. \\n\\nThe decor of the entire hotel has always been very inspiring to me over the years. We have begun to recycle more and introduce more nature into our apartment after our visits at the various 1 Hotel locations. \\n\\nWhoever oversees this or manages the 1... PLEASE keep doing what you are doing with these hotels. \\nI look forward to seeing you again soon. \\n\\nSkyler",
            "I really enjoyed my stay, especially the perks like the complimentary tesla car service provided by Evolve Limousine & Rentals for guests, this service alone is great value and would certainly secure a future stay just for the added benefit of getting around the city (big thanks to Richard and Anthony).  I appreciate the small details ex. rock to show \\\"do not disturb \\\" and the berry water in the lobby, also love the text concierge service.  The espresso martinis from the lobby bar are delicious, special thanks to Beth for the quality service and DJ Kori Hall for a great Saturday night. The only constructive criticism I have is the rooftop pool - operations seems a bit unorganized, and guests of the hotel aren't necessarily prioritized over random walk-ins for the limited seating available. It was difficult to order a drink by the pool and I had to seek out a server several times for water, drink order and seating on the pool chairs. The service was excellent once I found a server and pool attendee (they were kind, polite and tried their best), but I felt like they were overwhelmed or lacked proper support\\u002Fdirection.  Would certainly recommend for single, female travellers, I felt safe and had a positive experience",
            "Amazing experience from start to finish. Was warmly greeted and checked in by Mira who provided an extremely thorough overview of the hotel, how everything is sustainable, and aims to minimize waste as much as possible. The room was spacious, comfortable, and very clean. Bed was amazing. Gym was fantastic. Will definitely be staying here again",
            "This was one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed in. The rooms are incredibly comfortable, every design and function decision was made with true sustainability in mind, and the service is 10\\u002F10 (shoutout to Adrian). Highly recommend staying here",
            "Simply a wonderful place to be.\\nThe wooden surfaces, countless plants and the overall design makes you feel very comfortable. Check-in and check-out are thought trough, easy and digital and show that paper is not necessary. Breakfast and food in the restaurants are amazing, too",
            "This hotel was genuinely so amazing from the second you walked through the doors into the lobby.  Every part of the decor was so thoughtfully placed, and the focus on sustainability and bringing new life to otherwise scrapped materials was so great to see in a hotel.  The service was very efficient and easy to contact, as you could through texting the front desk, and not to mention incredibly kind and thoughtful. The room was so beautiful and felt really homey, and was a great way to spend a couple days away for an anniversary. Oh, and the food was really great. I still think about that avocado toast more often then I'd like to admit. Thank you for such a great experience 1 Hotel, looking forward to my next stay",
            "i was recommended to this hotel by a colleague who had stayed here previously.\\nmy wife and I were not disappointed. we are very environmentally conscious and everything this hotel stands for aligns with us and our views, which made the choice in booking here a non-given. we were not able to go up to Harriet's but enjoyed a few great cocktails at Flora lounge before heading out for dinner. there had been a couple of issues with my booking but Samantha at the front desk was very quick to assist us. she was polite and professional and was attentive to our needs. she also gave us some suggestions of things to do around the city and we had a great time visiting. we look forward to staying here again in the future. hopefully for a longer stay next tim",
            "What a transformation from the Thompson Hotel to now 1Hotel.\\nI thought Thompson was amazing, but 1Hotel has exceeded all my expectations.\\nFrom the moment you walk into the lobby, you feel like you're in a spa.  It's such a welcoming space and you just want to grab a seat and a drink and relax.\\nThe attention to detail and the commitment to sustainability is evident throughout the property.\\nIt's all the little touches that brings it all together.\\n5 stars all the way - I can't wait to go back",
            "I stayed in the suite with a lounger and it was the most comfortable stay I've ever had for business travel. The room is well-equipped with USB-A and USB-C which meant that I didn't even need my international plug adapter. There was a yoga mat which was a nice touch as well and allowed me to do some stretches\\u002Fexercises without having to go to the Fitness Centre if I needed to",
            "We stayed for a long weekend and enjoyed the many amenities.  Fruit infused water in the lobby most days and filtered water in the sinks\\u002Fshowers is a very nice touch during the summer.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The building can become crowded as there are long-term rentals, a business operating out of the penthouse, a restaurant and small pool area on the roof and only 2 elevators servicing the 15-20 floors (including subterranean",
            "Our connecting flight from Toronto to NYC was canceled and we were stranded for a few days. We arrived exhausted and miserable about our plight, but all that turned around within minutes of walking into this hotel. We\\u2019re checking out two days later and are almost sad to leave. \\n\\nThe staff are welcoming and highly attentive, the hotel room is beautiful and well designed, and the hotel bars and restaurants are terrific (though not cheap). The entire hotel is an aesthetic delight!There is a heavy focus on environmental sustainability, from using only recycled wood throughout the building to providing a lobby fruit stand containing less than perfect but perfectly edible fruit that would otherwise have been discarded at grocery stores. We did not use the gym or pool but we were told the gym includes Peloton bikes. Judging from the rest of the place, I\\u2019m sure both are gorgeous. Our studio room with a king size bed is spacious, very clean and bright, and well appointed with a Nespresso maker, tea, filtered tap water and snack bar. The bathroom is gorgeous and has a rainfall shower head and the shower gel, shampoo and conditioner smell heavenly. Even the hair dryer is much better than average.\\n\\nThe hotel is located in the fashion district, and although there is a lot of construction going on, it offers some nice dining options within walking distance. The hotel\\u2019s restaurants (including rooftop restaurant) are popular with non-guests of the hotel, so that tells you something. Plus, the hotel offers free Tesla rides within a 4 km radius, which gets you to several key areas such as downtown. \\n\\nIn short, we love this place and we hope to have an opportunity to come back. In fact, we already asked if we can come back if our flight tonight is canceled. Again",
            "Loved staying here. The colour palette was calming, the shower was spacious with great pressure and the bed was so comfortable. I loved the little sitting area with the couch as well. Overall I had a fantastic stay and definitely recommend",
            "Such a wonderful hotel. Rooms are so well organised, plenty of useful sockets and recharging points  (in the right places), spacious (we had a twin queen room for our family of four and it was very  comfortable). The hotel is eco- friendly and absolutely stunning inside. Everything was perfect, from the moment delightful Meera checked in us, to the hotel drop off at our hotel. It was so nice to come \\u2018home\\u2019 after a long day and debrief on the day\\u2019s activities with Meera! Robin the chef concierge and Demet (one of the house car drivers) were also stand out members of staff. A special place, with wonderful staff all round. Slippers are to die for, fresh fruit and refreshing coolers at reception are a nice touch. A few pointers: not so near to transport (the bikes and house car more than make up for that) but walking distance to Kettleman\\u2019s (great bagel shop\\u2026and lots of other eateries. Highly recommend all round",
            "Stayed here for 3 nights recently with two of my girlfriends and we had a fabulous time! We stayed in a two queen room which was plenty of space for the 3 of us and included a lounger and side tables. The toilet was separate from the shower\\u002Fsinks so it made getting ready easier. The bathroom counter is a bit small and there isn\\u2019t a ton of room - so give yourself lots of time for getting ready!  All of the staff were extremely friendly and the location is amazing! The city is so walkable from the hotel. The pool was amazing, the drinks were so good, and the staff were attentive and friendly. Only small complaint about the pool is that the food menu is extremely limited - hard for anyone with any dietary restrictions to eat! As the pool is right outside of Harriet\\u2019s rooftop it would make sense for the hotel to offer the same menu poolside!  Also\\u2026 adding a few more mirrors around the hotel and hotel rooms would be an appreciated extra touch!   Still despite all of this, 100% a 5 star experience and would stay again! It was the perfect getaway\\u2026 the mattress was sooo comfortable and I slept like a log each night",
            "Everything about this stay was perfect. The whole theming with wooden elements and plants made me feel welcome and relaxed right away. The room was just beautiful, the bathroom with the huge shower exquisite. Only fine materials. Kudos to the decorator. \\nWe had breakfast which was amazing(eggs with kale and buttermilk waffles) and drinks at the rooftop bar(highly recommend the Jojo and the dark side). The service was superior with a lot of complimentary treats (like a Tesla driving service). \\nI would 100% stay again. Keep up the great work",
            "Very accommodating on my adjusted arrival and departure times. The woody, clean, and sustainable design of my room made feel very comfortable. \\n\\nA few cool small things that are unique: I liked their \\u201Cdo not disturb\\u201D sign being made of a rock; they also have a wood tab that lets you leave things behind for donation in case you brought too many things. \\n\\nRooftop pool was very inviting with towel service and drinks. \\",
            "What an awesome, beautiful eco-friendly hotel with amazing interior decor. Would definitely stay here again! I want to check out the one in LA and NY. This hotel came recommended by coworkers who have stayed here before",
            "My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our four night stay at 1 Hotel. It is by far one of the finest hotels at which we've stayed over the years. The overall vibe throughout is calming and nature inspired. The large beautifully arranged lobby\\u002Flounge is where small bites can be ordered and live music enjoyed on weekends. We stayed in an upper level suite and loved the comfortable sectional sofa, having a shower and freestanding tub, and a window that opened for fresh air. The staff is committed to making it's guests feel appreciated and will do whatever it can to enhance their stay. Thank you Mira, for going above and beyond.  The concierge, Robin, was exactly who you'd hope for in any city. He is kind, respectful and very helpful. He suggested a local spa retreat and wonderful restaurants including Adrak, an elegant Indian restaurant with excellent food and over-the-top service. We have highly recommended 1 Hotel to our friends and will definitely return next year",
            "The most Beautiful Studio suite, with live plants, the wood decor, and everything thing just perfect. Felt like a magical forest retreat in the middle of the city. The care and ease of checking in and checking out, felt like coming home. \\nThank yo",
            "Everything was amazing.  This hotel really focuses on the little things.   For example, there was a yoga mat in the room and after the turn down service there was a robe laid out on my bed and a personalized \\u201CGood evening\\u201D note on the nightstand.  The staff are the friendliest I have ever seen.  Add in the incredible ambiance of this quaint little gem and you have a near perfect stay.  I couldn\\u2019t have been more delighted",
            "Stayed two nights and it was beautiful.  The location is ideal for anyone wanting to experience downtown, the lobby was inviting and groovy.  Room was perfect.  Interior decor was inspired, and the bed soooo comfy.  Absolute brilliant staycation for us.  Would highly recommend and will certainly go back",
            "1Hotel is an awakening of the senses. From the minute you walk in, you can\\u2019t help but to  feel like you have entered a sanctuary within the city. You can\\u2019t help but to take in all the plants, natural elements and signature scent to set the mood for a relaxing stay. My husband and I stayed in room 319 and it was beyond our expectations. The room was spacious and had a walk out terrace. The bathroom has heated floors and the concrete bathtub was as luxurious as they come. The Bamford products are now my new favourite. We loved all the attention to detail in our room to help make our stay feel like home. Everyone was super friendly and attentive from the front desk to the valet. The hotel has a beautiful roof top restaurant and pool with great views of the city. The lounge is beautiful and the cocktails amazing, especially their old fashion. The gym is well appointed with everything you need including Peloton bikes. We had a fabulous breakfast at 1Kitchen and we loved that they had gluten and dairy free options. We highly recommend this hotel- nothing big chain and impersonal about it",
            "We used the hotel as a retreat venue for our forum group.  From the moment you step in the lobby the atmosphere of green and relaxation envelops you.  The lobby had all kinds of great spaces to meet and connect with our group.  We used the lobby to do an impromptu meeting space. Our rooms opened out to a common space on the 3rd floor - it was beautiful weather so we also sat outside for one of our meetings.  All in all, the staff were welcoming and friendly.  Would recommend the accommodations as well as Casa Madera."

People say you don't sleep well the night before your wedding, I slept like a baby. The bed was so comfortable and luxurious. \\n\\nService -  The service at 1 hotel has been nothing short of incredible.  When walking into the hotel you are always greeted in a very friendly manner and they make sure you know that if there is anything you need, it is available to you if you just ask. They provided us a phone number to text them if there was anything we needed to our room and we always received prompt responses and they were always helpful.  \\n\\nFood -  THE FOOD.  When planning our wedding we had several meetings at the hotel.  The food at 1kitchen is always fantastic. The burger... wow!!  Again, all the staff are so friendly and want to ensure your experience is great.  The lobby bar makes a fantastic espresso martini for my martini lovers, and has a really great vibe in the evenings.  I couldn't believe how busy it was on a Saturday night!  The rooftop restaurant is not only beautiful, but also has fantastic food and drinks. \\n\\nOverall - great hotel, great rooms, fantastic staff and I cannot wait to go back time and time again.  I have already recommended the hotel and the restaurants in the hotel to so many people",
            "It was the perfect home away from home during our stay in Toronto. The welcoming and friendly staff made our stay extremely comfortable. The rooms were super comfortable with beautiful decor with everything needed for your stay, and anything additional needed was only a phone call away. Loved the Flora lounge and rooftop pool and the gym was amazing! Thanks to our favourite staff member Zoe for going above and beyond to make sure our stay was great. We will definitely be back, thank you",
            "If I had been expecting a 4 star hotel with a cool concept I would have given a much higher rating.  However, I was expecting a 5 star hotel that claims to separate itself from the pack.\\n\\nThe hotel is \\u201Ccool\\u201D but the service level simply isn\\u2019t there.  And there are real design flaws that create some inconvenience and, frankly, less than a comfortable stay. \\n\\nSome examples: \\nI don\\u2019t know of any 5 star hotel that charges a $5 delivery fee on top of an 18% service fee for room service (a salad).  It\\u2019s not about the money- since $5 more added to the high room rate doesn\\u2019t make that much of a difference, but it comes across as very \\u201Cnickel and dime\\u201D and no frills in concept.\\n\\nThere are no doormen or attendants (outdoor or indoor) when you walk into the hotel which would be ok except that it\\u2019s hard to open a heavy wooden (eco friendly entry door) with a roller bag and backpack.  Again, not a 5 star experience. \\n\\nOnly one working elevator that looked like an elevator in an office building and the industrial carpet was visibly dirty over the 2 days that I was staying at the hotel.\\n\\nWalls are thin and I could hear the sounds of plumbing (water rushing through the pipes) all night while I was in bed.  The hvac seemed to have issues as well.  When I came in the room it was freezing and by midnight was stuffy and overheated despite multiple attempts to lower the temp.  It only cooled off in the morning. \\n\\nHeated floors in the bathroom, which is a nice touch, did not heat up in the 45 mins that I was getting ready in the bathroom.  I don\\u2019t know how long that should take.\\n\\nBiggest bathroom complaint: the half wall glass shower caused water to spray everywhere outside of the shower plus it\\u2019s freezing in a shower when you can\\u2019t enclose it.  \\n\\nActual food is 6 or 7 out of 10.  Had two meals and was not impressed.  Food didn\\u2019t need to be fancy but should be reliable and tasty at a 5 star hotel. \\n\\nWhen I left the hotel at 8 am looking to check out- the lobby was 100% empty with nobody at the desk or any place that I could see.  I left the cool wooden circle key on the counter and left.\\n\\nMy waitress at breakfast provided good service.l\\n\\nIt wasn\\u2019t a bad experience but I won\\u2019t be coming back.  The price paid vs value received was a mismatch.  There are several 5 star hotels in Toronto that do offer a fantastic experience and can command their rates",
            "The new 1 Hotel Toronto has just been renovated and opened a few weeks ago. The staff are phenomenal. Anything I needed was handled quickly, and with much care. Matthew, the manager is very thoughtful and kind. Nicole always gets me the best tables at Harriets, whenever I have friends come from out of town. Ali manages the hotel amenities and always has a smile.  \\n\\nWhen you stay at this hotel you can use the bicycles they offer for free to cruise around the city. They included locks and helmets, and thought of everything we needed! \\n\\nWe used the Fieldhouse exercise facilities and found that the equipment was new, and the steam sauna was amazing. Overall great atmosphere, people, and service. I will be returning many more times! A considerable improvement from the Thompson Hotel",
            "Our 1 Hotel stay was exceptional!  We would like to thank Steven Dagenais who helped us get discounted corporate rates. He provided outstanding service and ensured that we were happy with all aspects of our visit!  Also, we had great assistance from Stephanie with finalizing the booking and she addressed any questions we had along the way. \\n\\nWe experienced 1 Kitchen for brunch and dinner, Flora Lounge for cocktails, Harriet's Rooftop for dinner and we also utilized room service for a meal!  The food and drinks are so fresh and delicious. We just loved all of it.\\n\\nThe rooms are so clean, unique and beautiful.  Sustainability was designed in everything from beautiful furniture, live plants everywhere and even the small items in each room.  \\n\\nThanks again to Steven, Stephanie and every single team member who were attentive, pleasant, happy and extremely quick to address all our requests!!",
            "We chose 1Hotel for our stay because we had stayed there a few times before. The rooms are consistently clean, beautiful, cozy. \\n\\nAs we we left our room, a few members of the housekeeping team were outside and one of them (Martha) stopped us ans asked me how to pronounce my name, I told her and she said she was assigned to clean my room during my stay, she asked if I had any preferences or needed any additional items in my room. She was so pleasant and each time we ran into her she'd greet us by our names. She always refreshed the room quite a few times without prompting so each time we entered it seemed like we were arriving for the first time. It was definitely above and beyond service. \\n\\nI downloaded the app on my last stay and added preferences and noticed that on this visit there were a few added special features like a fruit platter and a nice note on our desk when we returned to the room that was personalized to me.\\n\\nWe also had friends stay and worked with Melida, Director Front Desk, to have each guest accommodated. Two guests decided to join last minute and she made arrangements for them the day before, honouring our rate and even getting the rooms on the same floor (two of them.were right beside us). \\n\\nOverall our stay with respect to rooms and booking was fantastic",
            "Everything was amazing.  This hotel really focuses on the little things.   For example, there was a yoga mat in the room and after the turn down service there was a robe laid out on my bed and a personalized \\u201CGood evening\\u201D note on the nightstand.  The staff are the friendliest I have ever seen.  Add in the incredible ambiance of this quaint little gem and you have a near perfect stay.  I couldn\\u2019t have been more delighted",
            "Lovely hotel in a great location. The bed was very comfortable and the stuff quite friendly. Attached to the hotel are some great restaurants, so traveling far for good food isn\\u2019t necessary. It was nice they included a Bluetooth speaker in the room so we could play some white noise at night. Hallway noise could be a little distracting for some. Valet was very helpful and the lobby a great place to hang out for live music and drinks in the evening",
            "What a transformation from the Thompson Hotel to now 1Hotel.\\nI thought Thompson was amazing, but 1Hotel has exceeded all my expectations.\\nFrom the moment you walk into the lobby, you feel like you're in a spa.  It's such a welcoming space and you just want to grab a seat and a drink and relax.\\nThe attention to detail and the commitment to sustainability is evident throughout the property.\\nIt's all the little touches that brings it all together.\\n5 stars all the way - I can't wait to go back",
            "We have stayed in many nice hotels in many cities around the world. We visit Toronto every summer. I can confidently say that 1Hotel Toronto might be our favorite hotel EVER. \\n\\nWe stayed for 3 nights recently and from start to finish the service just wowed us. In fact, even before we arrived I had been in close touch with Robin Elliot, the Chief Concierge, who was the essence of professionalism, kindness and helpfulness when it came to recommendations and requests. He certainly did not disappoint when we finally had the pleasure of meeting him in person, and for the duration of our stay. Robin made our trip so memorable, going the extra mile constantly to always make sure we were taken care of and happy - which we most definitely were. His warm and engaging personality, positive energy and authentic desire to help blew us away. All 4 of us couldn't stop talking about how wonderful this person is! And we are not usually a gushy family!! \\n\\nEveryone from the front desk staff to housekeeping to the folks at the restaurant\\u002Fbar (1 Kitchen is a fabulous place to eat btw - we had 2 excellent meals here) exemplified the 1Hotel brand - super friendly, positive, there to help you and ensure your stay is perfect. \\n\\nAside from the superior service level (which for me makes or breaks the vacation), the room was beautiful, the fixtures pristine, the bathroom just so beautiful. We don't typically love doorless showers when traveling with kids BUT this one was so tastefully done and in keeping with the natural, sustainable, eco-friendly theme of the hotel which we loved and appreciated that we didn't mind at all. The lobby and interior of the building was also just so gorgeous - reflecting the hotel philosophy oh-so stylishly. Gym was fantastic which both myself and my teen son frequented. \\n\\nWe left feeling so radiantly satisfied with our experience and thrilled that we have found, THE ONE, no pun intended! This will definitely be where we stay from now on, whenever we visit Toronto. We already can't wait for our next visit next summer, if not sooner",
            "We stayed for a long weekend and enjoyed the many amenities.  Fruit infused water in the lobby most days and filtered water in the sinks\\u002Fshowers is a very nice touch during the summer.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  The building can become crowded as there are long-term rentals, a business operating out of the penthouse, a restaurant and small pool area on the roof and only 2 elevators servicing the 15-20 floors (including subterranean",
            "We decided to try the 1 Hotel Toronto for a theatre weekend because it was close to folk we wished to visit.  We were pleasantly surprised by by everything about the hotel from its helpful friendly staff to the emphasis on environmental sustainability.  They even arranged ground transportation to theatre which is a little further away than we were prepared to walk.  We'll be back.",
            "Not only is 1 Hotel beautiful, but the service is top notch. We used a third party site to book our room two weeks prior, and when we arrived to check-in, the hotel hadn\\u2019t received our reservation (fault of the third party site; not 1 Hotel.) By the day of check-in, the room rates had gone up. 1 Hotel matched the original rate and upgraded our room.\\u2028\\u2028\\n\\nWe were here to celebrate my husbands birthday, so they sent a complementary macaroon and fruit tray up to the room as soon we arrived, with a personal note wishing him a happy birthday. A small gesture that was greatly appreciated.\\n\\nWe went out for a couple hours, and when we returned, our room had been tidied up; bed remade, dirty towels removed and replaced, anything we had used in the room was restocked, the garbage cans were emptied, and all of our personal belongings were neatly organized.\\n\\nMost of all, I specifically want to thank Samantha G. for truly going above and beyond in helping us navigate our reservation not being received, for matching the original rate that we booked at, for upgrading our room, and for the note with the macarons and fruit. She was able to smooth out a bumpy start to our getaway, and make it extra special. \\n\\nAll in all, our stay was fantastic. We will be returning in the future, and I would highly recommend 1 Hotel to anyone",
            "We had a spacious studio suite on the 9th floor. Initial concerns over noise from construction across the street turned out to be unwarranted.  Highlights of our stay: the hotel restaurant was superb!!  A polished hand in the kitchen that was  on par with a fine dining establishment. \\n\\nFriendly staff  both in the hotel and the restaurant and not a whiff of attitude. Location was close to Farm Boy which meant easy access to breakfast and lunch goodies bought in advance and enjoyed later without having to leave the room.  Thor coffee on the next block was a jewel.  The bedding and the beds were fantastic. And the filtered tap water was great. \\n\\nThe only downside was the bar scene along King Street a couple of blacks away, that was noisy and crowded, not conducive to a relaxing evening strol",
            "Incredible stay, not long enough!  The sustainable design, vibe and convenient location just touches the surface of an incredible experience.  Customer care and service was outstanding.  Specifically, Helena\\u2019s personable and friendly demeanor was icing on the cake post delivery of her perfect libations tailored to delicious bar bites.  Fitness facility has it all and more.  Diverse and delicious menu items in on-site restaurants will not disappoint.  Rooms are well designed, very comfortable, and fitting for a leisure and travel accolade at minimum.  Will definitely revisit 1 Hotel Toronto and others in the brand.  Absolutely awesome",
            "I have stayed in my fair share of hotels and 1 Hotel Toronto is now one of my very favorites. The service, property, and amenities are impeccable. Brooklyn Lambert, the front office supervisor, and Robin Elliott, the chef concierge, both could not have been more helpful and such a pleasure to meet. They went above and beyond to make sure my son and I had a wonderful week at their hotel. The hotel is VERY enviromentally conscious. I have never stayed at a hotel where all of the water is filtered. Being able to fill up a water pitcher and have cold fresh water during our long stay was definitely a nice feature. \\n\\nAnd, the location can't be beat! They are just a couple of blocks off of King West and Queen West streets. Which means you are a short walk from a ton of restaurants and shops. The restaurants in the hotel are also all amazing! We ate at 1 Kitchen the majority of our time in Toronto! The hotel is also walking distance to the CN Tower and Rogers Centre, where the Blue Jays play. We walked to a game and were there in 15 minutes. In addition to the prime location they also have compimentary Teslas to take you places, within a certain distance from the hotel. There is also a grocery store a very short walk away.\\n\\nWe did take advantage of having a very nice gym and pool. If you have kids you need to be aware of the age limit for the pool. Even with the age limit, they were very accommodating for my 15 year old son to go to the pool during the day. There are personal trainers you can book time with, however I didn't have the opportunity to do that. \\n\\nI look forward to staying at any of the 1 Hotels. I certainly wouldn't stay anywhere else in Toronto. And, a huge thank you to Brooklyn and Robin for helping make my 50th birthday stay in Toronto wonderful",
            "When ever I travel to Toronto I typically stay at the Hazelton or the Fairmont but I decided I wanted to try something new and stay at the 1 Hotel.. and let me tell you I was not disappointed. I was blown away not only by how luxurious this eco friendly hotel is but also the exceptional service I received. I dined at Harriet's and Casa Madera and had some of the best dining experiences that I can remember. The guests service manager Kristy gave me her personal contact information and was so attentive to all of my needs. If you're looking for luxury, comfort, good food, incredible atmosphere, and phenomenal services this is the spot for you",
            "I organized a company holiday dinner at the 1 Hotel in the Chestnut ballroom and then up for drinks to Harriet's. The hotel is stunning, it's like walking into an oasis in the city, very unique and no detail overlooked. The food for dinner was incredible, the 360 view of the city on the terrace was unbeatable but what made the whole night was how attentive, warm and professional the staff were. Ryan the banquet manager and his whole team where just the most pleasant to work with and everyone at the dinner noticed, commented and were grateful for the enhanced experience.\\nWe will definitely be coming back for future events! \\nWell done 1 Hotel!\\nNadia T\\nWildcard Experienc",
            "I am not one to review. Normally I ignore the invites to do so but this group of individuals from 1 Hotel Toronto are absolutely awesome. My second stay, first was for business and second now for fun, I have to say I could tell the difference in how they personalize your stay. The Front Office Manager reached out to see if anything could do done to make this stay better so I was able to tell her about my wife joining. We were given a nice upgrade, a great return welcome and even the fine individuals in room service knew I was a repeat guest. I've been recognize before as a repeat traveller but this folks made it feel like home. You will know when you stay how you make a difference.\\nPros: The Staff, The Cleanliness the room, the location to queen st w, great texting service, sustainable impact\\nCons: Can be loud at night, doesn't bother me but woke up wife up a few times\\nTip: Harriets (rooftop) is not managed but the hotel but the Front Desk will try to get you in if you are a guest of the hotel. Haven't been disappointed yet. Loyalty is recognized",
            "We really enjoyed our friends trip to Toronto, and had an excellent time staying at the The One Hotel. The property was very clean, filled with light and I appreciated the additional attention to sustainability. The staff at the front desk was very helpful in offering recommendations for things to do and restaurants to visit. Especially Samantha",
            "The hotel promotes itself as a luxury hotel but the service is poor and it\\u2019s amenities are lacking.  If you ask about the hotels amenities, menus or services most staff won\\u2019t know the answer or worse, will simply make up an answer.  When asked if a house car was available and we were told that they didn\\u2019t know when it would be available or if it would be available.   As we walked out the door there were two house cars out front (30 steps from the person who had no idea when they would be available) that were empty and waiting to take guests wherever they needed to go.  \\n\\nThe hotel itself is beautiful and tastefully decorated but staying there is like giving the keys of a Ferrari to a someone learning to drive.   They don\\u2019t appreciate what they have, they have no idea how to use it, and so they can\\u2019t help others to enjoy it.  \\n\\nThe hotel was opened in August 2021 and promotes sustainability.  They even use Teslas as their house cars.   One small problem with this is that if you actually drive a Tesla (or any EV) you can\\u2019t actually charge it at this hotel.   Most luxury (and even standard) hotels have at least a few electric chargers at this point as automakers roll out more electric cars but this \\u201Ceco\\u002Fsustainable\\u201D hotel has exactly zero chargers.  It\\u2019s actually shocking (no pun intended). \\n\\nThe night life in the main lobby and roof was lively and had a \\u201Cclub\\u201D feel but if you want to experience real luxury and the service that comes from staying in a luxury hotel you may want to try the Ritz, Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, or one of the many other fine hotels in Toronto.  We wanted to give this one a try as we liked the whole sustainability concept but the service was a real let down and we won\\u2019t be back",
            "I really enjoyed my stay, especially the perks like the complimentary tesla car service provided by Evolve Limousine & Rentals for guests, this service alone is great value and would certainly secure a future stay just for the added benefit of getting around the city (big thanks to Richard and Anthony).  I appreciate the small details ex. rock to show \\\"do not disturb \\\" and the berry water in the lobby, also love the text concierge service.  The espresso martinis from the lobby bar are delicious, special thanks to Beth for the quality service and DJ Kori Hall for a great Saturday night. The only constructive criticism I have is the rooftop pool - operations seems a bit unorganized, and guests of the hotel aren't necessarily prioritized over random walk-ins for the limited seating available. It was difficult to order a drink by the pool and I had to seek out a server several times for water, drink order and seating on the pool chairs. The service was excellent once I found a server and pool attendee (they were kind, polite and tried their best), but I felt like they were overwhelmed or lacked proper support\\u002Fdirection.  Would certainly recommend for single, female travellers, I felt safe and had a positive experience",
            "I had the good fortune of hosting a bachelorette at 1 Hotel last month and can't say enough good things about our experience! Immediately after we had booked our stay, I was contacted by our host, Brooklyn, who was incredibly personable, enthusiastic, professional and welcoming! Brooklyn went above and beyond to make our stay great, and went the extra mile by way of offering helpful tips on places to go and things to see. The rooms are beautiful, and the beds are so so comfortable. The location is excellent for a night on the town, steps away from some of the best restaurants and bars in the city. I hope to be back soon",
            "The most Beautiful Studio suite, with live plants, the wood decor, and everything thing just perfect. Felt like a magical forest retreat in the middle of the city. The care and ease of checking in and checking out, felt like coming home. \\nThank yo",
            "I booked a suite for the night before our wedding and our wedding night. It was spacious and airy and had all the comforts of home. The kitchen had dishes and glassware and the bedroom had a portable speaker which came in handy to play music while the bridesmaids got their hair and make up done in the morning. Love the focus on sustainability (I don\\u2019t think anything was in plastic packaging or came in a plastic bottle) and recycling. The location is great and so close to transit and King West restaurants, though there\\u2019s plenty of dining options onsite as well. Would highly recommend this hotel (and we didn\\u2019t even get to use all the amenities!).",
            "This was one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed in. The rooms are incredibly comfortable, every design and function decision was made with true sustainability in mind, and the service is 10\\u002F10 (shoutout to Adrian). Highly recommend staying here",
            "1 Hotel is probably one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in! From the furniture to the food, everything has been thought out from start to finish. The customer service team is very attentive, and the plants in the hotel add such a gorgeous, fresh touch. Highly recommend staying here",
            "i was recommended to this hotel by a colleague who had stayed here previously.\\nmy wife and I were not disappointed. we are very environmentally conscious and everything this hotel stands for aligns with us and our views, which made the choice in booking here a non-given. we were not able to go up to Harriet's but enjoyed a few great cocktails at Flora lounge before heading out for dinner. there had been a couple of issues with my booking but Samantha at the front desk was very quick to assist us. she was polite and professional and was attentive to our needs. she also gave us some suggestions of things to do around the city and we had a great time visiting. we look forward to staying here again in the future. hopefully for a longer stay next tim",
            "I recently stayed at this incredible hotel in Toronto and was thoroughly impressed by their strong focus on sustainability. The diversity in their food and beverage offerings is remarkable, catering to all tastes with a global flair. The rooftop vibe is unbeatable, with stunning views of the city that create the perfect atmosphere for a night out. The employees are warm and hospitable, making every guest feel special, and the management's presence in the lobby and restaurants adds a personal touch to the experience.The trendy crowd and the lively atmosphere make this the place to be in Toronto. Plus, considering the prime location, the pricing is very fair compared to other downtown hotels. Without a doubt, this is the best hotel and restaurant in Toronto. I can't wait to come back",
            "Simply a wonderful place to be.\\nThe wooden surfaces, countless plants and the overall design makes you feel very comfortable. Check-in and check-out are thought trough, easy and digital and show that paper is not necessary. Breakfast and food in the restaurants are amazing, too",
            "Stayed two nights and it was beautiful.  The location is ideal for anyone wanting to experience downtown, the lobby was inviting and groovy.  Room was perfect.  Interior decor was inspired, and the bed soooo comfy.  Absolute brilliant staycation for us.  Would highly recommend and will certainly go back",
            "This hotel was genuinely so amazing from the second you walked through the doors into the lobby.  Every part of the decor was so thoughtfully placed, and the focus on sustainability and bringing new life to otherwise scrapped materials was so great to see in a hotel.  The service was very efficient and easy to contact, as you could through texting the front desk, and not to mention incredibly kind and thoughtful. The room was so beautiful and felt really homey, and was a great way to spend a couple days away for an anniversary. Oh, and the food was really great. I still think about that avocado toast more often then I'd like to admit. Thank you for such a great experience 1 Hotel, looking forward to my next stay",
            "We stayed at the 1Hotel last weekend (two rooms for two nights each). \\n\\nI'm not exactly sure how to rate our stay because lots of things went wrong, but the hotel also tried to make up for their missteps.\\n\\nLet's start with the good: this hotel is beautiful, landscaping is lovely, service is friendly, location is great, rooms are clean, and the gym is nice.\\n\\nNow the not-so-great: our room was double booked which we learned when someone with a key walked in on us, there was a $29 destination fee per room, per night (which nobody disclosed to us upon check in), one our rooms had frosted glass which was odd and meant that we couldn't see outside unless we craned our necks. \\n\\nAdditionally, everything we ate at the hotel was average at best Example: the avocado toast had some kind of premade spread instead of fresh avocado which wasn't tasty at all. \\n\\nIt goes without saying that this hotel is expensive so I had high hopes!\\n\\nLike I said, the hotel tried to make up for things by offering food and beverage credits (which we declined because we already had so many through the Amex FHR program). \\n\\nUltimately, they credited us the destination fees though, offered us another night on the house, and by their own volition credited one night back on one of the rooms. So 5 stars for their customer service!\\n\\nI'll likely give the hotel another try on my next trip...maybe we just came on an off weekend",
            "The 1Hotel team always raises the bar!  The atmosphere transports all guests into a sanctuary far  away from all the normal daily tasks and chores. \\n\\nThe rooms are designed to make you feel like you are one with nature with a beach not to far away. \\n\\nWe had the pleasure of dining at Harriet\\u2019s RoofTop for dinner. You can see almost a 360 of the toronto skyline. We ordered sushi, waygu, burrata and a multitude of mixed drinks. Nothing disappointed. \\n\\nWe also dined in for brunch and had their eggs Benny and focaccia French toast. All the flavours were amazing. Crazy enough the potatoes and in-house cured bacon stole the shop for me. \\n\\n1Hotel has definitely won me over from the other luxury resorts. They will become by home away from home from now on",
            "My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our four night stay at 1 Hotel. It is by far one of the finest hotels at which we've stayed over the years. The overall vibe throughout is calming and nature inspired. The large beautifully arranged lobby\\u002Flounge is where small bites can be ordered and live music enjoyed on weekends. We stayed in an upper level suite and loved the comfortable sectional sofa, having a shower and freestanding tub, and a window that opened for fresh air. The staff is committed to making it's guests feel appreciated and will do whatever it can to enhance their stay. Thank you Mira, for going above and beyond.  The concierge, Robin, was exactly who you'd hope for in any city. He is kind, respectful and very helpful. He suggested a local spa retreat and wonderful restaurants including Adrak, an elegant Indian restaurant with excellent food and over-the-top service. We have highly recommended 1 Hotel to our friends and will definitely return next year",
            "Stayed here for 3 nights recently with two of my girlfriends and we had a fabulous time! We stayed in a two queen room which was plenty of space for the 3 of us and included a lounger and side tables. The toilet was separate from the shower\\u002Fsinks so it made getting ready easier. The bathroom counter is a bit small and there isn\\u2019t a ton of room - so give yourself lots of time for getting ready!  All of the staff were extremely friendly and the location is amazing! The city is so walkable from the hotel. The pool was amazing, the drinks were so good, and the staff were attentive and friendly. Only small complaint about the pool is that the food menu is extremely limited - hard for anyone with any dietary restrictions to eat! As the pool is right outside of Harriet\\u2019s rooftop it would make sense for the hotel to offer the same menu poolside!  Also\\u2026 adding a few more mirrors around the hotel and hotel rooms would be an appreciated extra touch!   Still despite all of this, 100% a 5 star experience and would stay again! It was the perfect getaway\\u2026 the mattress was sooo comfortable and I slept like a log each night",
            "I liked my room very much. It\\u2019s we\\u2019ll decorated and comfortable. These days hotels are not so much a place to lay your head, but a place you can immerse yourself in, to eat, hang out, exercise and enjoy yourself. They know this too, which is why they create the ambience they do. Hotels in all sorts of places; Rio, Tokyo; London; New York, have excellent hotels that grant you some level of exclusivity that come with staying at the hotel. They have a beautiful pool deck\\u002Flounge\\u002Froof top, well if you\\u2019re a guest, you are welcome to enjoy. If not a guest, you have to wait in line and maybe get in or not. At the 1 Hotel, not the case. You do not get access to the lounge; you do not get onto the rooftop; you are the same as anyone else even though you are paying $600 a night for a room. No exclusivity. I felt like I was just a person filling a bed. Coming back from dinner, it doesn\\u2019t matter if you want to enjoy a night cap. I found this very frustrating and it did not make me feel like a valued guest",
            "I was wondering if this location would live up to the Miami location and it definitely does. I am an avid traveler and a foodie, the 1 Hotel is definitely right up my alley. My girlfriend and I came to Toronto for a weekend getaway and I am SO happy we chose this spot.\\n\\nEvery single staff member, from the front desk, to the bartenders, to the pool service, to the housekeepers, EVERYONE was genuinely happy, attentive and so friendly. Making us feel right at home. \\n\\nThe food at the restaurants is absolutely delicious. Try the Bento Box up at the pool, it was the perfect lunch. Also stopped into the 1 Kitchen for a drink before dinner. The spicy marg was perfectly concocted. \\n\\nWe treated ourselves to a suite with a bathtub and it was SOOO relaxing. The perfect way to unwind after a long day. The gym was also very impressive. Literally every piece of equipment you could ever ask for. I don't usually hit the gym when I'm on vacation but I couldn't resist with the selection of clean and unique machines. \\n\\nThe decor of the entire hotel has always been very inspiring to me over the years. We have begun to recycle more and introduce more nature into our apartment after our visits at the various 1 Hotel locations. \\n\\nWhoever oversees this or manages the 1... PLEASE keep doing what you are doing with these hotels. \\nI look forward to seeing you again soon. \\n\\nSkyler",
            "No detail is spared when you stay at 1 Hotel. This is my second experience at a 1 Hotel property, and it just keeps getting better. Jonah, Shamar, and Omar at the front desk\\u002Fbell services were an incredible help to us each day. Maxine and Sabrina were wonderful in the Flora Lounge. The danish and breakfast options in Flora Lounge were fantastic. Lunch at 1 Kitchen was extra fresh and the Aperol Spritz bar was so fun. We visited the Rooftop and my goodness, the views are incredible and the ambiance is unmatched. The rooms are impeccable and their commitment to sustainability at every point in your stay is truly remarkable. How do we get more hotels to be like 1 Hotel?",
            "Very accommodating on my adjusted arrival and departure times. The woody, clean, and sustainable design of my room made feel very comfortable. \\n\\nA few cool small things that are unique: I liked their \\u201Cdo not disturb\\u201D sign being made of a rock; they also have a wood tab that lets you leave things behind for donation in case you brought too many things. \\n\\nRooftop pool was very inviting with towel service and drinks. \\",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at 1 Hotel Toronto. It\\u2019s location to the water, Queen street shopping and the Stackt market was convenient. The hotel lobby and my room offered a breath of fresh air from the noise and the busyness of the city. I was warmly welcomed by several of the staff. After a long period of travel that left me dehydrated and hungry, there was fresh fruit and flavored water to enjoy while I checked in. My room was an oasis of calm. Though I was street side, the noise didn\\u2019t penetrate the space and the interior design of the room made up for the lack of a view. Everything that the hotel offered that I took advantage of was a positive experience. I borrowed a bike and the concierge provided me with a safe and easy path to the bike path that runs along the water. After a long day, I decided to order room service for dinner. There were several excellent vegan, healthy options. The carrot soup was amazing. It was delivered by an extremely friendly staff person and in a timely manner. My room was equipped with a bathtub. The hotel provided bath salts so I decided to end the evening with a bath. It was a very calm environment and perfect way to end a busy day. The bathroom has everything anyone could need. The toiletries they provide are high quality and smell amazing. The hair dryer was also of high quality. It was a Dyson. I usually travel with my own hairdryer when I check luggage because the hotel hair dryers usually fry my hair. I recently stayed at a Ritz Carlton property assuming they would have a really good dryer but they surprisingly had a super cheap one that made my hair frizzy for the whole trip. Since I was only doing a carry-on, I left my hair dryer at home and was so excited to see that the 1 Hotel stocks their rooms with such a nice hair dryer. . Never underestimate the importance of these small details. The other cool feature of this hotel is that they have Tesla house cars that can take you places in the city within a certain radius. Even though I didn\\u2019t take advantage of this, it was nice to know that it was an option.",
            "Location is great for exploring Toronto.\\n\\nWe stayed as a family of 4 in two adjacent rooms (king and panoramic king). The rooms are spacious and decorated with a simple luxury, modern and sustainable vibe. Equipped with all you need including nespresso machines, hairdryers and irons!\\n\\nThe hotel even provided Dyson hair straighteners when my wife\\u2019s UK model would not work with the power supply (thank you!).\\n\\nBathrooms are well appointed with luxurious Bamford cosmetics.\\n\\nGood amenities including a gym, rooftop bar and pool.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the excellent 1 Kitchen breakfasts, but were unable to make the most of the very highly rated Casa Madera (which was booked out privately the only night we could make it \\uD83D\\uDE14) or the rooftop bar which closes very early Monday-Wednesday (1030pm). \\n\\nThe lobby bar was a great place for cocktails, with a chilled ambience and live entertainment.\\n\\nThanks to all the team for looking after us",
            "The 1 Hotel is a perfect execution of luxury sustainability. With a full gym and classes available to experience. Great restaurants and a rooftop with a 360 view!! They also have a house car for transportation within the area, but most of the hot spots are within walking distance of the hotel",
            "We used the hotel as a retreat venue for our forum group.  From the moment you step in the lobby the atmosphere of green and relaxation envelops you.  The lobby had all kinds of great spaces to meet and connect with our group.  We used the lobby to do an impromptu meeting space. Our rooms opened out to a common space on the 3rd floor - it was beautiful weather so we also sat outside for one of our meetings.  All in all, the staff were welcoming and friendly.  Would recommend the accommodations as well as Casa Madera.",
            "Such a wonderful hotel. Rooms are so well organised, plenty of useful sockets and recharging points  (in the right places), spacious (we had a twin queen room for our family of four and it was very  comfortable). The hotel is eco- friendly and absolutely stunning inside. Everything was perfect, from the moment delightful Meera checked in us, to the hotel drop off at our hotel. It was so nice to come \\u2018home\\u2019 after a long day and debrief on the day\\u2019s activities with Meera! Robin the chef concierge and Demet (one of the house car drivers) were also stand out members of staff. A special place, with wonderful staff all round. Slippers are to die for, fresh fruit and refreshing coolers at reception are a nice touch. A few pointers: not so near to transport (the bikes and house car more than make up for that) but walking distance to Kettleman\\u2019s (great bagel shop\\u2026and lots of other eateries. Highly recommend all round",
            "I attended 1 Hotel for a work meeting, using multiple parts of the hotel, and wow. The service and attention to detail throughout the entire experience was unmatched. We enjoyed excellent cocktails from the lobby bar and a delicious tasting menu with Chef Roland. It is conveniently located in downtown Toronto but everything you need can be found within the hotel. Anyone looking to book a professional, high-caliber event will be in good hands here with Steven, Kencia, and Dan",
            "What an awesome, beautiful eco-friendly hotel with amazing interior decor. Would definitely stay here again! I want to check out the one in LA and NY. This hotel came recommended by coworkers who have stayed here before",
            "1Hotel is an awakening of the senses. From the minute you walk in, you can\\u2019t help but to  feel like you have entered a sanctuary within the city. You can\\u2019t help but to take in all the plants, natural elements and signature scent to set the mood for a relaxing stay. My husband and I stayed in room 319 and it was beyond our expectations. The room was spacious and had a walk out terrace. The bathroom has heated floors and the concrete bathtub was as luxurious as they come. The Bamford products are now my new favourite. We loved all the attention to detail in our room to help make our stay feel like home. Everyone was super friendly and attentive from the front desk to the valet. The hotel has a beautiful roof top restaurant and pool with great views of the city. The lounge is beautiful and the cocktails amazing, especially their old fashion. The gym is well appointed with everything you need including Peloton bikes. We had a fabulous breakfast at 1Kitchen and we loved that they had gluten and dairy free options. We highly recommend this hotel- nothing big chain and impersonal about it",
            "Our connecting flight from Toronto to NYC was canceled and we were stranded for a few days. We arrived exhausted and miserable about our plight, but all that turned around within minutes of walking into this hotel. We\\u2019re checking out two days later and are almost sad to leave. \\n\\nThe staff are welcoming and highly attentive, the hotel room is beautiful and well designed, and the hotel bars and restaurants are terrific (though not cheap). The entire hotel is an aesthetic delight!There is a heavy focus on environmental sustainability, from using only recycled wood throughout the building to providing a lobby fruit stand containing less than perfect but perfectly edible fruit that would otherwise have been discarded at grocery stores. We did not use the gym or pool but we were told the gym includes Peloton bikes. Judging from the rest of the place, I\\u2019m sure both are gorgeous. Our studio room with a king size bed is spacious, very clean and bright, and well appointed with a Nespresso maker, tea, filtered tap water and snack bar. The bathroom is gorgeous and has a rainfall shower head and the shower gel, shampoo and conditioner smell heavenly. Even the hair dryer is much better than average.\\n\\nThe hotel is located in the fashion district, and although there is a lot of construction going on, it offers some nice dining options within walking distance. The hotel\\u2019s restaurants (including rooftop restaurant) are popular with non-guests of the hotel, so that tells you something. Plus, the hotel offers free Tesla rides within a 4 km radius, which gets you to several key areas such as downtown. \\n\\nIn short, we love this place and we hope to have an opportunity to come back. In fact, we already asked if we can come back if our flight tonight is canceled. Again",
            "I stayed in the suite with a lounger and it was the most comfortable stay I've ever had for business travel. The room is well-equipped with USB-A and USB-C which meant that I didn't even need my international plug adapter. There was a yoga mat which was a nice touch as well and allowed me to do some stretches\\u002Fexercises without having to go to the Fitness Centre if I needed to"

Breakfast room is a bit small, but you can take back to your room. \\nWe loved the location and self guided walking tour from the hotel to the uni area, entertainment district, lakeside, downtown.

            "I booked several rooms for the family and got a group rate as we were coming down to Toronto for a wedding. The service was excellent, they were very accommodating and the rooms were nice, clean and very spacious. Only thing that was not so great was that my sister got an older looking room on the 2nd floor and everyone else got nice renovated rooms in the higher floors. I would recommend this hotel to friends and families",
            "Nice hotel. Good location. Comfortable bed. And clean and tidy. Staff polite and helpful (the tour firm they recommended for Niagara falls were great and reasonably priced. I even did the boat ride, which was spectacular. ) Some negatives: they clean the room every other day (maybe that is the norm); there were a few broken things in my room (one of the lights and the towel rail); the gym is private and needs to booked and paid for). The breakfast is minimalistic,  but suited me as I don't each much first thing in the morning.  I was on the 27th floor or what they call the PH floor. Overall,  I would consider it again",
            "The room are fully equipped with Kitchen amenities, they are spacious and comfortable. This hotel is centrally located and easy access to subway and food outlets. Also it is safe location for families who intend to visit Toronto.  Their front office Manager Mr. Vishal was very helpful as he was always available to address our concerns",

            "I booked the Junior Suite with kitchenette, and a washer & dryer. These were extremely useful! It had a full-sized refrigerator and stove, and a dishwasher.  The suite was very, very clean and comfortable. I was on a high floor, with a great eastern view (note that there is construction on the west side.) Front desk staff are very professional and attentive. They recommended the purchase of a monthly parking pass to save me money. I also recommend using transit downtown. The Bloor\\u002FYonge subway interchange is less than a five minute walk away, and the subway is accessible (elevators and escalators - at least in the city core). The neighbourhood is people-friendly, and well served by caf\\u00E9s, restaurants, shopping, and small grocery markets nearby. Internet service was very good. I don\\u2019t have cable tv at home, and enjoyed watching that. NOTE: As with many suite hotels, housekeeping will visit only once per week; I didn\\u2019t need anything, but the front desk would have obtained extra towels, etc. I would have stayed longer if I could have, and the Town Inn will be my base the next time I am in Toronto. Book early so you get a high floor and a better view!  NOTE ALSO: if you park at the hotel, there are stairs from the parking garage to the elevators. I managed fine, but persons with more severe mobility issues will need to be dropped off at the front entrance or use the \\u201CGreen P Parking\\u201D on Charles Street.\\nThis hotel is an exceptional value for the city centre. Thank you, Town Inn!",

            "This was the second time I stayed at the Town Inn Suites. The first time was back in 2018 and then again, this past August - both times for work for a week at a time. Vishal and his team were very helpful, and they did everything they could to make our stay a comfortable one. The suites are a wonderful size and well equipped for a week's stay and the location can't be beat. The only thing that would have my stay perfect would have been to have a foam mattress topper to make the bed less firm. Will definitely stay again",

            "Awful place depending on the room you get (I can only presume from the disparity in ratings that some are OK). Stayed in a two bedroom apartment on the fourth floor for one night. $600. Garbage left from previous guest, filth on the floors, mould on the roof, no blinds on the door (no privacy!), urine stained sheets, lamp not working, lights blown, shower hanging off and furnishings that were falling apart and looked like rodents had been chewing at them. I\\u2019ve stayed in hundreds of hotels for work an leisure and this is the absolute worst.\\n\\nArrived jet lagged with disabled mother needing to sleep immediately, so conveyed this to reception in the morning and they didn\\u2019t care at all (and, based on previous comments here they haven\\u2019t bothered to address anything!) Asked for a reasonable refund via Expedia, sending photo evidence, and it was refused (not even partial goodwill gesture) on the basis we didn\\u2019t notify the hotel, which we did. $600 for a filthy and only partial working apartment\\u2026 some would called that daylight robbery! \\n\\nWould have given zero, but the two staff at reception \\u002F front of house were polite",
            "Fantastic place as your close to where you want to be.  After travel in 3 time zones from Hawaii, Houston and Toronto in one week this apartment hotel is a great place.

Breakfast is continental style but well stocked(except for missing sugar which was quickly rectified). Breakfast room is small so plan on  taking breakfast back to your suite. Location feels safe for a solo female traveller, and has a convenience store across the street. Bloor and Yonge are a short walk away.  \\nThe slippers are a lovely bonus. \\n\\nRegarding some reviews - Anyone who is a seasoned traveler should be aware that hotels do require credit cards. This is a long time well known practice and should not come as a surprise to anyone, it's not the hotels responsibility to inform you directly",

Has a pool and sauna for your personal use.   Hotel is in an amazing location close to all attractions and walking location to shops. Hotel staff was very helpful Assisting with our needs. Room was modern and nicely decorated. Only thing about this hotel is there is a $1000 deposit required for stay even though we  only spending one night. However due to the hotel amenities inside the room fridge stove microwave and newly update could understand why. When booking wanting great location and feeling the comforts of home away from home this is a great place to stay",

The place screamed \\u201Cdeferred maintenance.\\u201D  Furniture was old, tired, and uncomfortable. Extensive water damage in the bathroom. What was described as granite countertops were plastic. Everything about this suite screams \\u201Ccheap\\u201D from the poor quality flooring to the tiny televisions. To make matters worse, the hotel has no gym, which I consider unacceptable in 2024. There is actually a gym in the building but the hotel has no arrangement for guests to use it. I am really regretting booking at this place",
            "I'm always so impressed with the suites. They are spacious and are well stocked. The king size bed was extremely comfortable and the pillows were soft. There were two TVs in the suite and the WiFi worked extremely well. The whole place is very queen and the staff is always friendly.",
            "I cannot say enough about the amazing staff here. Check in and out is easy. The staff are polite, professional and efficient. I overbooked as I was coordinating for family members and they released the extra room with no penalty and no questions asked. Value for money is synonomous with the Town Inn Suites in Toronto, especially at a time when hotel stays have really sky rocketed. This still feels afordable without sacrificing expectations for clean and comfy stays. Having the extra room of a kitchen\\u002Fliving room and a one bedroom was perfect with multiple wedding guests staying here. The continental breakfast was great - croissants, yoghurt and lots of coffee in a clean dining area. There is parking (extra fee) and a an easy in\\u002Fout drive so that checking in and dropping luggage is a breeze. This is a great place to stay when in TO and not far from key areas of interest. We stayed here a few years ago at Christmas also and happily the consistency from then til now is noteworthy",

We were directed to the front desk which is in a closed off glass room! Keeping the lobby quiet. Staff was polite and helpful. When we reached our room we were pleasantly surprised as the suite was spotless, modern and inviting. Same for bathroom and bedroom! Visiting during a crazy time with the Coronavirus in full panic mode we still sprayed Lysol everywhere but there wasn\\u2019t a fingerprint to be found and it felt like we were the first to ever stay in this room. We highly recommend for all those reasons but the location was also ideal for us",

            "We booked this hotel at the last minute, which is not normal for us but we had some circumstances that made it necessary.  This is the most we've ever paid for a room. $290 per night Canadian,  There were plenty of great things about the hotel, especially the location that was convenient to Toronto's wonderful public transportation system and good walking as well.  There were supermarkets nearby.  The desk staff were friendly and I appreciated that they wore masks.  It was handy to have a kitchenette in the room and the bed was notably comfortable.  Trips of 5 nights or more came with a free airport pickup, which worked as planned.  The shower was good with plenty of hot water.  I liked that they had recycling in the room.\\n\\nWe often stay at low budget hotels, and this place was less clean than most.  Attached are some photos of just a sample of the stains and food that were smeared on the wall when we checked in.  There was a weird stinginess about the place.  For example, the room came with a dishwasher and we stayed 5 nights, but they only provided us with 2 dishwashing detergent tabs.  There was also a coffeemaker, but for two of us they provides a total of 4 coffee pods.  The room was serviced once during our 5 days, which was okay if they had let us know but it was strange they didn't tell us and we started to get overflowing trash.  There are some cooking implements but no hand dish soap, salt, etc.  We bought a bunch of breakfast food when we arrived because their website said breakfast was discontinued due to Covid, but when we left the first morning we saw that they were serving breakfast.  They have one instant coffee machine that folks were lining up for, with pastries, apples and yogurt.  The balcony looked inviting but was locked for unexplained reasons",
            "We come with a group of 20+ people. The prices are really fair for the rooms we got. Spacious living room with a lot of facilities such as dish washer. Though it's a pity the balcony could not be accessed. Pool and gyms are closed due to the Covid. The staff were super helpful with the recommendations and even helped us to find agencies to book some trips. The service was fast when we needed something. Great location as well,  the street behind the hotel has a lot of restaurants and bars. Close to Eaton Centre",

Better to go out on the streets for a pastry.   \\n\\nLocation is amazing.  Staff friendly",
            "Stayed here for 5 days. The staff are extremely  helpful and efficient and have a professional  style. We were upgraded to a lovely apartment before we left Australia  perhaps  because  we mentioned  that we were on our honeymoon!! Jun couldn't  do enough for us with emails back and forth, prior to us beginning  our trip across  Canada. The Deluxe King Suite was lovely..even has a kettle!!! Kitchen is very modern with good appliances  and full size oven and stove top. Large microwave oven, and very large stainless steel  fridge. The only minus was the free breakfast.  Very basis choices indeed..\\nThere is a decent grocery store at the corner of the next block, which is a few minutes  walk ( a convenience  store is directly across from the hotel) (didn't go to that one). A hairdressing  salon is just around the corner and Croissant  Tree restaurant  is diagonally  opposite.  This eatery is great for any time of the day meals or snacks. Very cheap quality food in a nice setting.. There is a coin laundry in the hotel and an indoor pool. Dog friendly  too. Definitely  would recommend this  hotel",

I was a little apprehensive at first when I checked in Sept 2021 for a month as I am currently a resident of Toronto, in transition to moving to another city in Canada. But this hotel really feels like my own apartment; Neat and clean, organised and located in the heart of downtown Toronto. Check in was smooth. Also the photos online are the same as that of the suite; brand new appliances and furnishing. The staff here from front office to cleaning to maintenance, everyone is nice, courteous, friendly and quick to respond especially the Office Manager Vishal Mistry.

            "I had stayed at this hotel years ago, and I was aware that hotel had gone through renovations but did not know what to expect..  When I booked room originally there wasn't two double beds room available online.  When I checked I asked if one was available, the manager quickly looked into it, and was able to give me a suite, at nominal increase in price.  When I walked in the room I was totally surprised how beautiful it was.  It was very modern, clean, and comfortable, the suite was very large.  It had stove, microwave, dishwasher, where I made good use of the appliances, during my 4 day stay.  The cleaning staff was a very sweet lady, and accommodated me with towels, toiletry, dish washer detergent, etc, I had told her it was ok not to make beds etc, I would take care of it. The location is great spot, close to many amenities, restaurants, shopping, few blocks away from Bloor St.  Wi Fi was free, and used it a lot for work and leisure. I was pleasantly surprised of this hotel and will plan to visit there again",
            "I was looking for a place that had a kitchen, and so this hotel provided a great full kitchen. But the suite was extremely bland, with laminate floors, plain walls, and Ikea-style furnishings. No personality at all. The room was large but I would have gladly given up half the space for an ounce of elegance and aesthetic appeal. The old-fashioned heating unit never got the room temperature above 19 degrees and so I had to get a space heater in order to bring the room to a comfortable temperature. Despite the website saying that the hotel had been renovated, the bathroom was the style of a Motel 6. The bathtub was strongly stained, giving it a very shabby appearance. There was no hook to hang bath towels. On the plus side, the parkade was very convenient, running $30\\u002Fnight. The staff was extremely friendly, with a very pleasant check-in. One drawback that is not due to the hotel itself is that it is directly across the street from a large construction site. Construction began at 6 am, hence not allowing for a full night\\u2019s sleep",
            "We had a really excellent stay. The room was clean. The hotel manager and his staff are so friendly and efficient - they are like a family. Excellent location downtown. Everything you will need is in the apartment and the kitchen is fully equipped. The Wifi is fast and reliable. Would definitely recommend this place",
            "Always clean. Employees always ready to accomodate clients.\\nRooms clean. With the kitchenette, really practical. We recommand.\\nWe book sometimes last minute and they have rooms. With or without kitchenette",
            "I am an out of town professional frequently needing a place to stay in Toronto. The Town Inn and Suites  is centrally located and my preferred place to stay.  The Team at the Suites are friendly and professional.  From Ivy who takes the reservation to the Manager Vishal greeting you when you check in.  The Suites are clean, spacious and trendy.   I look forward to my stays. Strongly recommend!",
            "Had to review! Stayed twice in 1 week, seeing 2 rooms, 1 with kitchen and 1 without. Both were perfectly clean, spacious, well decorated and comfortable.  The staff was very helpful; you got the impression, they all wanted to make sure your stay was the best it could be. Parking ($30 per night) was a little pricey, but easy to use and very convenient, appreciated. The atmosphere on colourful Church street and the convention shops surrounding the hotel greatly added to our seamless, stress free stay. You\\u2019ll definitely feel safe.  Across the street and south 100m is a great coffee shop in the morning and a pub in the evening, providing a perfect start and end to your day.  Do not hesitate to stay at this hotel, period",
            "My wife and I spent 5 nights here. The location was close to the gay village neighbourhood and high-end Yorkville Ave. We were able to walk to most things we wanted to explore. \\n\\nThe hotel room was a cute, cozy, and clean apartment. We had a full kitchen, living space, bedroom, and bathroom with a rainfall shower. It was everything we needed to have a relaxing space to enjoy after a long day of exploring. \\n\\nWe only used housekeeping once since we were only there a few days. If we requested clean towels or toilet paper from the front desk it was brought up in less than 5 minutes. \\n\\nA classic continental breakfast of muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit was provided each morning. \\n\\nWe stayed in a \\u201Cluxury king suite, one bedroom\\u201D booked through Hotels. ca and the room was wonderful. I\\u2019d stay here again",
            "The hotel was very accommodating when they could not find my Expedia reservation. They managed to find me room, which they upgraded, and gave me complimentary parking. The room was big and spacious with all the necessary amenities. The only downside was the rock-hard beds. Very uncomfortable and would be a reason I wouldn\\u2019t return",
            "Suites are spacious, stylish and comfortable. Great location! Seems to be no daily room service but fresh towels were delivered to our door without delay when we asked one evening. Staff very professional and helpful.\\n\\nBe aware that they put a large security deposit on your credit card as if you are renting an apartment (which you basically are). Ours was $500 for a king suite",
            "I was a participant in a conference in Toronto, near Church and Bloor Streets, and the conference chose this hotel, since it's nearby.  I was favourably impressed.  I don't understand the very negative reviews, and I think there may be an agenda behind some of them.  I do understand the mildly critical reviews; yes, the property is aging and the decor isn't bright and fresh.  I can also see how some might find the neighbourhood a bit sketchy, especially with current construction, though some Torontonians find it rather trendy.  But I liked the large rooms, open space, well equipped kitchen, comfortable bed, and well functioning plumbing in the bathroom.  There's nothing like room service, which I almost never use anyway.  But against that is the low price by Toronto standards.  At the front desk I got delayed a bit by what was described as a misunderstanding between the conference organizer and the hotel, though I think the misunderstanding was on the hotel's side.  The staff was friendly about it though",
            "It's not the nicest hotel in Toronto but it checks off all the boxes in terms of everything you'd need from a hotel. Rooms are big with a kitchen, although I didn't use it. There was also a free breakfast, which didn't have a ton of options, but helps with a quick start to the day. The staff are great and I'd probably come back",
            "I've been to various downtown hotels over the years and the rooms are often very small. I really enjoyed this condo-like \\\"suite\\\". Mine had a small kitchen as well as a living room area. Note that the hotel has different types of rooms.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the stay. I also found the bed to be very comfortable. The living room was nicely arranged. Really had an excellent time and would have happily stayed longer",
            "We use this hotel for our business partners and guests and we cannot be more happier with them. They have a huge pool, the suites are nicely updated and the staff are amazingly helpful and kind. Highly recommended",
            "I stayed in a suite here for 2 weeks while looking for somewhere permanent to rent. My suite was perfectly fine, not high end luxury but not budget either. It had quite a large kitchen and living space, a bathroom (with a shower but not a bath), and a separate bedroom. I wasn't here on holiday so it was nice to have some form of kitchen to cook with. The kitchen had most things you would need.\\n\\nThe bedroom was a little on the small side, partly because there was a huge king sized bed and not much room for anything else. The bathroom was nice, but I had some problems with the hot water in that I had to leave the shower running for 30 minutes sometimes before it got to a reasonable temperature to shower in. Since moving into a condo in Toronto I have the same problem, so I wonder if it's a common thing here.\\n\\nThe wifi was a little slow but functional. I had to sign in again every 24 hours which got irritating given I was there 2 weeks.\\n\\nI stayed here during the COVID-19 pandemic and I was self isolating here after arriving in Canada. The staff were mostly accommodating of this. The only issue I had was requests getting misinterpreted when calling down to reception for something, usually ending up in them bringing the wrong thing or too much of something which was wasteful. Because of the circumstances during my stay, the location made little difference. But if I were getting about, I think I might have found the location a little too far away from the centre",
            "The Place is close to Downtown.  This neighborhood is known as \\u201Cgay Village\\u201D.  It\\u2019s not a problem for us, but some may don\\u2019t like.  People from the hotel were very nice.  In fact, our suite was a huge apartment complete, with 2 bed rooms, kitchen And 1 bathroom.   No breakfast.   Ideal for familys and thouse who travel in small groups",
            "My family and I, including 2 cats,  had to find an affordable place to stay while we were putting our condo on the market to sell. The location had to have a full kitchen and enough space for us all and more importantly would allow flexibility on the duration and of course accept pets.  Town Inn Suites was just the spot in the city. Super friendly, kind and professional staff, amazing location, clean and very diligent when it came to bring us items we needed",
            "This is an excellent accommodation for anyone seeking a little more room than what a standard hotel offers. Sure there are signs of wear and tear throughout, but the rates are excellent, and the rooms are so spacious. Also, the customer service was absolutely fantastic. All the staff we interacted seemed attentive and willing to go the extra mile to help their guests"

Rooms were nice and spacious, and pretty clean, given it was a hotel of course. Staff was friendly, and shout out to the awesome breakfast attendant who you could see took pride in her work",

I feel terrible that I didn't not yell it out before I left!! they said i would not be charged but then i received a phone call yesterday saying I was only being refunded for 1 night because I didn't tell them sooner well I had not clue that 3 bites from the first night was bed bugs so how was I supposed to say anything?!?! Clearly they were only concerned with making sure the current guests didn't find out about the bugs. once I was gone charged me anyway!  the room was also not clea",

We requested a room close to the elevator and we were almost as far away as possible. We would maybe stay again if we plan to visit the zoo, only because of its location",

It is clean, well appointed, and in a relatively safe area.  the pool and hot tub are nice but the pool was abnormaly hot this time around.

I am thankful at least to have a room as they were fully booked on the second day.  It was a pain having to check in and out again the second day and now im looking out for billing anomalies on my credit card.  just a hassle.  Was told it was a \\\"glitch\\\" but i suspect an error by a new employee checking me in who didnt seem to notice that two people can share the same last name",

At check-in, the staff member told me that my request for a quiet room (not on the highway 401 side of the property) wasn't noted on my reservation. Strangely, I can see it myself when I log in to the Best Western site and view past reservations. Overall, for me, the property looked fine from outside, but was dingy and neglected on the inside.",
            "The only good things I can say about the hotel is the location, otherwise, it\\u2019s just far below my expectations, it\\u2019s not cheap (but maybe because I booked it just a couple of weeks before my journey), but the service and cleanliness is just \\u201Cbeyond anyone\\u2019s imagination\\u201D. The Wifi was out the night I checked in, I called the frontdesk and asked if the Wifi wasn\\u2019t working, first they hanged up! I had to call second time. And it took them one whole night to fix it while the staff promised me that they would fix it in 30 minutes (but of course we all know how technical problems work, sometimes it\\u2019s just like that, I understand), I tried after one hour, it\\u2019s still not working, so I just went to bed, hoping everything will be fine the next day. The problem is when I asked about the internet connection the next morning, the staff was very unhelpful, and appeared annoyed. If you ask no questions or are happy with unfriendly responses, maybe you will feel okay staying here. Besides, the cleanliness was also terrible, the floor was so sticky and it felt like I stepped on paper with glue on. But maybe it\\u2019s just my room, it was not the main point, just that staff here were not friendly at all. Oh, god, if you would like to pay and suffer, I highly recommend this hotel!! It is a perfect choice for you",

Upon opening it it was absolutely obvious that it had never been made, I don't mean that there were not blankets, I mean that it had blankets that had quite obviously been slept it, including hair and sweat stains on the blankets, it also had a vape in the blankets.\\n\\nWe called down and spoke with Mohammed who didn't really understand the issue, so we had him come up to the room and look, he offered to give us clean blankets so that we could change the bed, but we refused and our children were not interested in sleeping in the bed after seeing the state of it and the vape. He took photos to forward to his Manager and we requested to change rooms. He was apologetic and went downstairs to try and find us another room, he had us meet him on a lower floor that had some sort of party going on and was now a floor away from the rest of our family group. Finally, he found another room on the same floor for us, and dressing in pajamas, we had to pack up all our belongings, move to a new room, unpack, then finally go to bed.\\n\\nWhen we checked out, they acted like nothing had happened, and we asked to speak with the Manager, who was not in. So we spoke with the Supervisor who offered us $2 in reward points, and gave us a 6% discount... She told us that it was all she could do and we would hear from the Manager. We are at a week now and we've heard nothing from the Manager.\\n\\nIn addition, none of the ice machines worked, and none of the vending machines worked. The breakfast in a morning was limited due to COVID restrictions, as was pool use, which is understandable, but their breakfast \\\"sausage\\\" was chopped up hotdogs, and anything other than cereal in a ziplock bag or eggs was hidden around a corner that you had to ask for, but it wasn't even possible to see it in order to ask for it.\\n\\nWe are extremely unsatisfied with our experience and the customer service, apart from Mohammed who initially check us",

Thick dust on the head boards. The doors where covered in dirt. The worst night sleep. You could feel the springs thru the mattress. I had to be @ the hospital @ 6am. For day surgery.

Surroundings (businesses) are almost empty (for rent) and the nearby ancient hotel is now a homeless shelter (no issues as far as I've experienced, all is clean, civil and organized).\\nShower and bed were of good quality, sheets and pillows very comfy. Room A\\u002FC quite noisy and air didn't feel very clean (maybe because of the run-down carpet).\\nBreakfast is worth not missing. Croissants, all kinds of bread, waffle machine, yogurth & juice choices, well presented and replenished all the time.\\nDid not use swimming pool but people there seemed to have a good time.\\nParking was easy, parking lot was clean (though did not find a garbage bin outside).\\nCheck out was smooth and I got my invoice on my app immediately, no troubles.\\nWARNING: Petrocanada gas station nearby had deffective pump charging without filling. Nobody there cared. Avoid",
            "I would not recommend this hotel at all. The room we received had stains all over the couch in the room, and the provided desk chair, as well as an odor of body fluids. We also had no desk lamp as it would not turn on. We asked to have a new bulb\\u002F or lamp and were told no that they don't do that. That might have been for the best considering what we could see was dirty. When we went down for breakfast in the morning the eggs had hard spots in the and tasted like they sat out  already once and then re-heated and put out again. The second afternoon that we were there someone vomited in the elevator, with a wet floor gin covering it. The sign did not help the smell of the vomit, and was left like that until the following afternoon went it was then mopped all over the elevator. Like come on people do better !! When any issues were brought to the front desk for attention they simply replied no no sorry..... But they didn't do anything or care ! Oh and one more thing, my nephew bought a soup thing at the concession area and then asked for a spoon and was told no they don't have utensils for those items.... Then don't sell them",
            "We came for a wedding, tented 4 rooms and the hotel staff were very nice. There was a strong smell of Marijuana in our room, but it was remedied quickly by the manager coming in with a machine to clear it. And complimentary wate",
            "Exceptional customer service in all aspects of accommodations.  The staff at the front desk, the breakfast servers and the cleaning staff were always friendly, helpful and so professional.  The location of the hotel was superb with eating places close and yet nestled in a good location.  I would highly recomend this hotel to anyone who wants to be in a wonderful environment while away from home",
            "I chose this hotel because it was the closest and most convenient one for my purposes. It was a little on the expensive side but that was my fault as I waited till last minute to book. Needless to say I was a little apprehensive about it as I had booked it only because I needed a place to stay and didn't have another option at the time. But I was pleasantly surprised. They let me check in late, my room was on the 4th floor, and big enough with an excellent view over the parking lot and Markham Road and the 401. In spite of its close proximity to these, I was not troubled by any noise. There was a microwave and fridge in the room which again was necessary for me, and the breakfast was absolutely amazing with every single option available that one could possibly think of. The only thing I would suggest improving is the breakfast seating area, as there wasn't much space. For me it was fine as I was by myself, but some couples and families had a problem finding seats to sit together. There is a gym and swimming pool but I didn't use them. Front desk is very very helpful. My booking was for two separate rooms as I couldn't get the same room for three nights but they changed it for me so I stayed in the same room. They also allowed me to check out late. \\n\\nEven though my first time staying here was because I didn't have a choice, I shall definitely stay here again, this time by choice, and I'll make sure I book well in advance to get a good rate.",
            "Nice hotel, clean, great breakfast, friendly staff. Enjoyed 3 nights there for our girls hockey tournament and won a Gold medal! Staff was very tolerant too, having a big team there.  Many hotels aren\\u2019t. Rooms were a bit warm but thankfully the thermostat was easy to use. Only complaint...  please don\\u2019t rudely call at 11:18am, tell us checkout is 11 and ask if we\\u2019re paying the  $75 late checkout fee, as we\\u2019re walking out the door.",
            "This was the only hotel available that was in close proximity to the event we were attending. We were pleasantly surprised. Clean room, good bathroom products.\\nPleasant staff, and a fairly decent breakfast included with room cost. By no means a high end hotel. However, totally adequate for a one night stay. No bar, or restaurant, which in our case was not required. We did not use the Pool or fitness centre. However, would have if time had permitted, they both looked totally fine. We are quite particular, and would have no problem staying here again",
            "Had to stay on a last minute need - and was hesitant due to COVID.  The front desk staff was extremely professional yet friendly.  The hotel was clean and modern and my KIng room was large and comfortable and very clean.   Unfortunately breakfast was not available due to health restrictions.  Would come back just to try that",
            "I stayed there overnight for one night and when I booked I specifically asked for no chemicals to be used in the room prior to my stay as I have extreme allergies to fragrances.  They assured me that my room would be chemical free.  I also called a couple of days before my arrival to confirm that my room would be chemical free and,, again, was assured that my record stated that it be chemical free.  When I arrived, the room was highly fragranced, which is a nightmare for me.  Since someone from housekeeping was a couple of rooms down from mine, I asked her if they use plug-ins or something and she said no to the plug-ins but she had sprayed the room with something \\\"to make it smell nice\\\".  I told her that I expressly booked with no-chemical designation.  She said she did not see that on my record.  She then showed me another identical room that she had not sprayed yet and I told her that one was fine and went to the front desk and asked to be moved to the new room.  The gentleman I talked to was quick to let me move my belongings to the new room and I left to attend the event that i was in Toronto for.  When I arrived back to the room around midnight, it smelled like something had been sprayed in the room and it was horrible for me and made me quite ill.  Since it was midnight and I knew the hotel was fully booked and would not be able to move me, I endured the fragrance but was not well at all in the morning.  I sent a note to the hotel the next morning and also talked to someone at Customer Care.  I got a note back from the hotel that did not address my concerns and a week later, I am still waiting to hear back from Customer Care.\\n\\nIn this day and age, when so many people are allergic to fragrances, sprays, chemicals, I do not understand why this is necessary.  I have always been able to count on Best Western, but not any more, it seems"

            "In January\\u002F2024 stayed 1 night with parking for 2 weeks. As usual, it was an excellent stay. We have stayed at this hotel several times mostly in the past, but decided to stay prior to our trip in January\\u002F2024. I phoned the hotel this morning to make another reservation. I needed a room, 2 beds, parking for 2 weeks. The same package as we had in January. To my complete shock, the gentleman on the desk quoted me $420.+ tax.!!! When I asked why the price was so high, he responded with \\\"well, it's the time of year.  We need the room for the night of Dec. 19\\u002F2024, & we return Jan. 3\\u002F2025. Why are we expected to pay a higher price for the date needed, rather than what the rate is on the date of booking. In Jan. we paid approx. $340.00...this increase is not acceptable., & I'll be calling someone come Monday morning. If this is the way the Best Western operates, you can be sure we'll be staying elsewhere",
            "The price was crazy of course, but a better value than the other hotels on the list.  The beds were comfortable and the staff was super helpful answering calls and helping out when they could.  Food was delivered cold and the air a bit stale with no windows that open, but I certainly felt welcome and not like a hostage",
            "Nice hotel. Stayed here for 1 night after arriving at midnight form a flight. Just 7 min away from the airport. There is a shuttle service running every 30 min during the morning and every 1 hour during the evening. I believe that they should maintain a 30 min frequency all day long, as I had an evening flight and had to wait almost an hour for the next van to leave. Rooms are big and wifi service is quite fast. My room was clean as well as all the hotel common areas",
            "Decently priced and close to the airport which is what we needed.  Thankfully they had a shuttle running early morning which was really convenient.  We had a domestic flight at 6:45am so we had to be at the airport by 5ish.  They had shuttles running even at 4am.  We got on the 5am shuttle which got us there in plenty of time for us to drop off our bags and catch our flight. Sleep wasn\\u2019t the greatest but that is likely due to anticipation of getting up on time.  The room temp could have been a better.  We had the ac running all night and found the room a bit stuffy\\u002Fhumid still.  Staff was lovely and friendly.",
            "I had a terrible time at this hotel, virtually in prison in a room with sealed windows, as my welcome to Canada. I was incarcerated here, with very average meals in paper bags, while quarantining - this despite the fact that I had had *two vaccinations* and a negative PCR test. I was charged $1050 for my one night's stay. (I was released from hotel quarantine after my second test result came back negative.) It is a disgrace that the hospitality industry seeks to profit from ordinary people's misery - the pandemic is bad enough already. The facilities were fine, and the staff friendly and capable. But why could they not find it within themselves to **refund** what I had paid for the other two nights. It is my hard-earned money, not yours! $1050 for one night in a sealed room and indifferent meals in paper bags = not OK",
            "This hotel was awful, over priced for cold rooms and overpriced breakfast. I would not recommend this hotel to no one. My family and I had returned from a vacation and had been greeted with  a cold room and had to sleep in our clothes in the bed. Staff knew and brought us 2 old blankets which had holes in them. They said the temperature of hotel was set in furnace room and they could not change it. We paid over 200.00 a night thinking we would get a comfortable stay but we got the complete opposite. My poor children had slept in their clothing in the bed!! Awful awful experience.",
            "Love that the room I was in was lino instead of carpet. The Indian dish from the attached restaurant with the homemade chili sauce was excellent. The hallways above ground floor are a little scary because they are dark and the air system is loud. Mixed feelings about the pool and spa area . Enjoyed having it to myself ( you have to book ahead)  but do not use the wet spa. I turned it on and a LOUD high pitch buzzing came out of it and stayed on the ENTIRE 45 min I was there. Just use the dry spa. Much quieter and more enjoyable. The hot tub was tepid. The guy who drove the shuttle at 530 in the morning was super rude to me which I didn't understand as I was feeling happy and grateful. Oh well. I was even more happy and grateful after I was away from him so I'll call it a win. Overall I was really happy with the hotel even with some of the negatives. The people working the desk were all very friendly. I'd stay there again",
            "I was disgusted with the stay. I called Friday to speak to the manager. Did not hear back. When I checked out Sunday we again asked to have a manager call me. As of mid day on Monday I haven\\u2019t heard from anyone. My bed had dirty sheets on it. When I called down she told me to wait until morning. After saying they was totally unacceptable and some back and forth I finally convinced them to find a way to send me some sheets. In which I the had to change in my own.  If they were short staffed I should have been offered a new room. Was locked out of my room regularly I had 4 additional keys by the time I checked out. None in which worked.  When systems were down on Saturday we waited an hour after saying our keys didn\\u2019t work and just needed into our room. Finally asking for someone with a master key to please just let us in!  Awful experience. I stay at the convention centre often for events. Will never ever stay here again and I was there on a Friends and family from the owner of another location!",
            "I booked this hotel for my mandatory quarantine, for me and my 5 year old..\\nWhen i booked I specifically put 1 adult 1 child and made payment for everything but two days later i got an email with a extra charge of 75$ plus tax per night for my kid and 50$ service charge, I understand now with covid everything is different but i wish i knew that the costo of the hotel would be 350+ extra to what i had already payed for.. because that\\u2019s important info! Overall it was ok because I understand we have follow protocola and we are there just to wait for the test but with a 5 year old food can get boring anyway we left after a day no big issues the hotel was ok just not happy with the hidden fee even if you call and ask they will say no extra and everything is covered because i did call and ask still got the email saying please know you will be charged extra ! 75$ plus tax for the kid! \\nShuttle bus was more than 20 minutes but i guess is not that bad. Clean room enough food vending machine available everything ok \\uD83D\\uDC4D",
            "Very clean room, excellent service in restaurant.  Covered Parking. Great for against the elements. One of the closest to the airport for a park, fly, stay scenario. You can stay either at the beginning or end of your trip. Shuttle to the airport is included",
            "The staff on duty in the best personnel any organization can wish for. Very passionate about work and very professional at receiving guests and helping them settle-in. The building is well maintained and reasonably close to the airport. Hotel also has a great airport shuttle services which helps you save some money on taxi. I will certainly stay at this hotel the next time I am flying through Pearsons int'l",

Highly recommend it! The staff goes out of their way to make you feel welcome and at home, the facilities are clean and inviting, and it was perfect location for myself and my husband to get to the airport and for my business meeting at the Congress centre",
            "We booked this hotel for one night at the last minute as we found out upon landing from our flight from the Caribbean, that our connecting flight to Halifax was cancelled due to winter storms in Atlantic Canada. The front desk was very accommodating and let us stay in the same room a second night when our new connection was delayed another 24 hrs again, even though they were completely booked from all the flight cancellations. The food in the bar was fantastic and the servers kept our beer mugs replenished regularly. We have stayed in BW\\u2019s all over the world and they have always been very comfortable but this one is the best with top notch service and updated rooms. We will choose this hotel again whenever we have future layovers in Toronto.\\",

            "Hotel personnel were very professional and friendly.  We had dinner at the restaurant and the food was exceptional.  I will be returning to this fine hotel.

            "We like to stay close to YYZ for our flights and as we had an early morning flight this was perfect. We stay the night before our flight and this was the first time we stayed at this property. We booked on Expedia and paid $ 207.99 taxes in with our CAA membership. The property was clean and modern and was close to3 or 4 places to eat within walking distance and within the hotel itself. It had a pool and fitness centre and for those who like plane watching you can\\u2019t get any better. What stood out about this hotel was the customer service. From entering the property to checkout the staff was excellent. We will book this hotel again and would recommend it highly",
            "I was there for a 3 day quarantine. The whole thing was a disaster. First of all, they ended up charging me more the price I had reserved and when I tried to inquire, the front desk manager was very rude to me and telling me they are charging me to tip them without even my permission. The food itself was garbage. I had to order food delivered even after paying over $1000 for a 3 day hotel stay. They only provide 1 500ml of water per meal and you have to buy if you require more water or juice. Don\\u2019t book with them and go with another hotel",
            "After flying in from Mexico early as a result of Covid-19 it was good to be back in Canada. The front desk was staffed appropiately and precautions were in place. Although the dining room was closed take-out establishment names were available, as well as a cooler with sandwiches,beverages and yogart for sale. I requested a room close to the elevator as I was walking with a cane and have  a bad knee. The shuttle driver  on both trips to airport was friendly and extremely helpful",
            "Staying during mandatory hotel quarantine. Loved having a microwave and fridge available to me. All other amenities were good, bed, bathroom ect. Food quality was mediocre but plentiful.  Would have been nice to be given a choice between meals (the meat and vegetarian option for example)",
            "This hotel was used by guests to throw a party and gathering of more than 10 people and the hotel did nothing about it! This clearly breaks the bylaw in ontario.  They booked 3 rooms and had more than 12 guests between all 3. They were constantly moving between rooms slamming doors and screaming. I called to complain about noise and they did nothing except ask them to keep the noise down. I confronted the group in the hallways and counted more than 10 people. They claimed they weren\\u2019t breaking any rules because they had 3 rooms (however they were clearly all jumping from room to room together). I reported it to the hotel staff who I heard knock on their door and asked them to keep 10 or less in a room. They knew they were breaking the bylaw and let it happen! If it wasn\\u2019t after midnight and I was in desperate need of sleep I would have and should have called 311 and reported the party. The hotel should have done the same. Instead I continued to hear doors slam and screaming all night long. So much for a good rest before travelling. I travel often and would never stay here or at a BW again. Beware of this hotel.",
            "Stayed here recently and my review is mixed.\\nThe room is clean and bright and overhead air traffic is not a problem. Front desk staff are friendly and helpful.\\nDisappointed in the parking availability. Definitely not something you can bet on. Internet and tv were down for the majority of the time is a major disruption when you\\u2019re travelling for business and need to connect. The restaurant is handy but overall you\\u2019d be better off elsewhere.\\nDon\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll choose this property again",
            "Looking for a good price in Toronto for a 10 night stay was a stressful nightmare, but i managed to get a decent price at Best Western. Considering the price I paid, I wasnt really sure what to expect for a room. Yet when i checked in, I was greeted with a nice, big king sized room, fridge and microwave which was helpful for my long stay. The bathroom was alrger than what i expect from hotel bathrooms, ans the open half glass wall shower made showering breathable (as someone who overheats easily). The internet was surprisingly fast and all of the staff I saw during my stay was amazing. I ordered from the restaurant once, and the server on that night was just as friendly and helpful. \\n\\nI have never had such a good stay in a hotel before. Thank you thank you thank you for such a wonderful stay! I look forward to my next trip to Toronto. I'll be looking to book here first",
            "A lot of partying going on. Just needed a place to sleep near the airport in between flights. Sleep was minimal, doors slamming all night, loud guests. Vomit outside the exit doors, could have been much cleaner. Definitely won\\u2019t stay there again if I plan on actually sleeping",
            "Stayed at the Best Western Premier for one night before an early morning flight at yyz. Booked \\nA room with 2 queen beds and the price was good for 3 people. Clean, fast and friendly service and close to YYZ. Tips when booking this hotel included close to Parknfly, close to Airzona bar and grill with good food at good prices and if you like plane spotting this hotel is for you. Overall the property is quiet, clean and the staff were excellent. Will be back",
            "I have stayed at this hotel numerous times. It is immaculately clean, great service, & the restaurant on site provides delicious meals at reasonable prices. There's really no need to go off the property to eat. HOWEVER I recently called to get a quote for a room for 2 people, 1 night (park'n'fly package). The reservation I want is for December 23. Yes, that far in advance, as our vacation package has us booked for an outbound flight Dec. 24. I was advised by the woman on the desk that as of the time I called, the room was $X., which I thought to be very reasonable. HOWEVER, upon learning of the date I was wanting, I was quoted a ridiculously higher price. She said that they base the cost of the rooms on the number of guests at the time I want. \\nTo me, when I'm quoted a price today...then told it will be $ higher for when I want, you can be sure I'll stay elsewhere. The woman also suggested to me that I wait 'til the 1st week in October to see if the price quoted would be lower. At peak travel time during Christmas, nobody is going to wait that long to book a room. I therefore said \\\"no thank you, I'll go elsewhere\\\", which I have already booked. By the way, Best Western the \\\"elsewhere\\\" quoted me $150.00 +tax for a one night stay, & 1 week parking which is there park'n'fly package. I asked if the price would go up when the reservation was indeed needed & I was told that \\\"No, we quote you a price today, that's the price you get it for..it won't increase'.\\nNo thank you, Best Western. You've lost a loyal customer",
            "I stayed here for business travel during COVID-19, during an extended overnight flight layover and it did the job. The hotel was clean, check-in was quick and it's less than a 5 minute \\u00DCber ride from Terminal 3. My room faced the airport which meant I could hear the low rumble of aircraft taking off during the night but it wasn't that bad that it bothered me.\\n\\nThere are two things I base a hotel recommendation on; a comfortable bed and a nice shower with excellent water pressure, and this hotel had both of those. The TV was also wall mounted and larger than most hotel room TV's, which I appreciated. The coffee maker used the pod system, so if you are staying here for an extended period, you could use your own pods or a refillable one. The coffee was quite good, but I can't remember the brand they use.\\n\\nDue to COVID, all their other services and ammenities like the free breakfast and the gym, were closed, so I'm unable to comment on any of those. I would stay here again without hesitation",
            "We stayed in this hotel following a short trip to Niagara Falls.  It was awesome!  The hotel and rooms were immaculate.  The beds were great and our sleep was amazing despite the landing planes.  We were able to use the gym and pool (with a sign up sheet) and the kids were thankful for that.  The hotel is minutes from Pearson Airport and you can jump on the highway and go anywhere.  The hotel staff were absolutely amazing and super-responsive!  They were so good, in fact, that we impromptu extended our stay by a night and hit up Canada's Wonderland the next day!  Would recommend",
            "I love this hotel. Perfect rooms, prefect parking. Everything is amazing when you stay in this hotel close to Pearson airport. They offer 15 days parking package for traveling. Rooms are well decorated, modern and clean. Breakfast and amenities better than any other hotel in the area.",
            "My wife and I stayed for 1 night prior to our flight. The hotel is so convenient to Toronto Airport and their package pricing was very competitive. Very friendly and helpful staff. The rooms are attractively decorated and the walk in shower is a real plus. Very good towels and bed linens and the king sized bed was really comfortable. We would definitely stay here agai",

            "Stayed here for 2 nights unexpectedly because my flight home was delayed. Very happy I randomly chose this place - I wanted something budget friendly and didn\\u2019t need extra frills or anything. All the staff I spoke to were friendly and helpful, restaurant\\u2019s food was good, beds were comfy, room was clean. No complaints! I\\u2019d stay here again. The airport shuttle every 30 mins was very convenient too.",
            "I was surprised and disappointed at the poor service from the staff and the poor cleanliness of the room, having stayed at hotels near airports quite a few times before around the world. Please note that there are 3 different airport hotels, and they do have a business card at the front desk which clarifies the locations for the shuttles! I really would have liked not to have problems, considering I had an early start the morning after my first night - I didn't get breakfast vouchers until I asked for them, although I paid the breakfast rate, and didn't learn about them and what's included until I overheard from other diners in the restaurant. Please bear in mind that there will be loud banging of doors and talking outside your room at all hours of the night",
            "It\\u2019s an ok hotel. There are better close by. I was here on business, the staff were friendly for the most part. As my employer was paying for the hotel costs, I did not have much of an option. They tried to get me to give them my personal credit card for the security deposit. I explained that they had a card on file and they could use that for the deposit. After some discussion they figured it out and I went on my way. There were a few families living at the hotel and although they were noisy in the early evening but by 9 pm quieted down. Due to Covid protocols there was no room service, but I could call to the front desk if I needed anything.\\nEveryone was friendly including the 2 security guards working the front lobby.\\nThe room was clean, except for the coffee maker, which I decided not to use as it looked like it had seen better days. The refrigerator worked well and kept my stuff cold. \\nWhen I checked in they told me the restaurant would be open for breakfast, but I did not use the restaurant for any meals.\\nOverall it\\u2019s not bad, I have stayed in worse hotels. Next time I might try a hotel that is closer to restaurants",
            "I am totally disgusted the way my friend and I were treated on our recent stay at the above noted hotel. Since 2017, I have stayed at this property 5 times and never had an issue, however, my stay from14\\u002F9\\u002F2022-18\\u002F9\\u002F2022 was a nightmare. First our room was not cleaned once in the 4 day stay. Apparently you have to make an appointment at the front desk to have your room cleaned. Leaving the sign on the door for housekeeping is no longer sufficient enough and we were never told we had to make an appointment and no where in the room or on my reservation does it state you have to do this. After accidentally finding out about making an appointment, we did that on Saturday night by calling the front desk and again on Saturday  morning in person at the front desk and yet our room still never got serviced. Late Saturday night a hotel employee drooped a plastic bag off to our room containing towels, garbage bags and bed sheets. What an insult to me as a loyal customer! Tis hotel expected us to clean our own room. Is this the new norm with this hotel? Overcharge\\u002F price gouge customers and expect us to clean our rooms, change garbage and bedding etc! I will NEVER use this hotel in the future and I am doubtful I will use The Best Western brand again. The management and some of the staff could use courses in customer service. I am appalled by the disrespectful treatment we received at this hotel. I rate this place ZERO",
            "This Best Western is a very well designed and appointed property. Our room was well appointed and the bathroom had a walk-in shower.\\nThe restaurant offered a great menu and the food was excellent.\\nExtended parking is also available. We will definately stay here agai",
            "Best Western is very close to airport. Staff were very courteous. Hotel was very clean. Room was clean, roomy & bed comfortable. We ate at hotel eatery hostess was very nice and food was good. Airport shuttle is available",
            "The worst hotel I've stayed at in years!\\n\\nWith one exception, all the staff was so rude, unhelpful, and impatient with every guest.  They made us feel like they were doing us a favour by checking us in rather than welcoming us as their customer.\\n\\nBooking a reservation for the hot tub was very difficult because, again, I was inconveniencing them. \\n\\nWe booked our shuttle for the morning and, as directed, were downstairs 10 mins ahead of schedule.  Good thing we did because the shuttle driver was over 15 mins late reporting for work.  Fortunately, we purposely went to the airport extra early just in case there was an unexpected delay...like someone reporting late for work",
            "Prior to making my reservation I called the hotel to enquire about a late check out. I was told to ask upon check in. Which I did, which was promptly refused. I had booked the hotel specifically for this reason, having a late flight the next day, so I was not happy at all.\\n\\nThe room was fine, although I question the need to make guests pay for using the safe.\\n\\nThe shower needs looking at, the spray goes all over the place. An easy fix, but obviously overlooked by housekeeping.\\n\\nThere is no power outlet next to the bed, to the extend that the alarm provided by the hotel is not plugged in.\\n\\nUpon check-out (at 12, since I could have the late check out) I was charged for parking. While I understand this to be normal practice, I feel guests should be made aware - on the website as well as during check in.\\n\\nI was able to leave my bags at the hotel (no charge this time), I appreciate this.\\nOverall, the staff was friendly",
            "We had a need for an overnight stay in Toronto with our dog - and this hotel is pet friendly and near the vicinity of where we were going.  The room was fine - the floor a little sticky from disinfectant we assume- but ok.  We did need to pay a pet fee, but it was reasonable compared to some places.  Breakfast was not included but there is a Coffee Time nearby and also a Hooters offering some food options",
            "The hotel was very clean and the amenities provided in the bathroom were well thought about.  The food was not superior in any way. The staff was very accommodating and pleasant. The rooms are made up every second day which I would have appreciated being made aware of.  Some people might be annoyed at the constant aircraft flying directly overhead but I found the sound proofing of the room excellent.",
            "We booked here again, along with a friend because of the free parking and shuttle to the airport.  In addition, the rooms are clean, and they have a nice little restaurant on site.\\n\\nGood service, pleasant staff, and easy to get to.\\n\\nOh... and one of the most comfortable beds we\\u2019ve ever slept in",
            "The staff are lovely at the hotel and extremely helpful.  The room was clean and basic. It is right on a flight path, but the noise is not noticeable at night. \\nParking is covered so problematic if you drive a larger vehicle such as a pick-up truck. No other options nearby to park. \\nThe restaurant is good and their staff helpful but has limited choices. This makes it difficult for those who have food restrictions. \\nThe Internet is slow, and TV is a little baffling regarding figuring out channels but that could be me not figuring it out properly. \\nIt is a pleasant hotel with courteous staff. Very responsive to communications as well.",
            "This hotel is not the most chic but it is very clean and mere minutes from the airport. I live two hours from the airport and loathe the idea of delving into airport traffic. Travelling is hectic enough! This hotel offers a one night stay rate with $10\\u002Fday parking for your trip and a free shuttle that keeps you out of the airport melee. It is really a great solution and the staff are helpful, solicitous and courteous",
            "Staff was especially welcoming and friendly. Our room was clean and dog friendly.\\n\\nBut we caught this hotel at a bad time. There were two elevators for guests but one was not working when we arrived. Then the second one failed as well. The security people in the lobby helped guests to find the service elevator to go up but any guest on the fifth floor who had baggage and a child was left wondering how to go down. Signs would have helped them. \\n\\nThe HVAC in our room did not work and neither did our coffee maker. Coffee in the lobby cost $3\\u002Fcup.\\n\\nDespite being next to the airport rooms seemed well soundproofed",
            "Needed location near airport for early flight with free shuttle to same. Best Western is a reasonably priced brand I know I can trust.  I was very impressed with modern d\\u00E9cor of  room and bathroom  AND individual shampoo\\u002Fconditioner- so hard to find these days.  They really got it right with a shower cap and make-up remover towelette.  Bed was extremely comfortable.   The room and bathroom were  sparkling clean.  Keurig coffee machine was a nice touch.  Definitely recommend this hotel. Due to covid didn't use pool\\u002Ftub.",
            "This was a nice, clean hotel. Close to the airport, with shuttle service. Our room was spacious and included a King sized bed, walk-in shower, mini fridge, and microwave. We were a bit worried about our quality of sleep, being so close to the airport but we slept very well and didn\\u2019t notice the noise of the planes taking off\\u002Flanding. Our only issue was that both elevators weren\\u2019t working when we came in after dinner. There are no indoor staircases, which was odd. A staff member brought us up to our floor, using the staff elevator, so it wasn\\u2019t a big deal. Overall, I would recommend this hotel for anyone needing a place to stay, close to the airport. I should also add that the front desk staff were very friendly and welcoming",
            "After travelling many years, this hotel hit the mark in all areas: helpfulness, check-in, cleanliness, restaurant, location (for my needs) and exceptional staff.  The two gentlemen at reception were outstanding. They were patient, informative and had a sense of humour. I would highly recommend this hotel",
            "I stayed in room 319, and while the decor was a tiny bit dated, the bed was very comfortable, the black-out curtains were amazing, and the staff and restaurant really made this stay very enjoyable.  I appreciated the fact that the lady at the desk helped me with my luggage, given that i use a mobility aid, and had been struggling a little bit.  Oh, and the room i was in was an accessible one, with the roll-in shower, and accessibility bars, etc.  I was right around the corner from the vending machine, so that was a great perk as well.  The room appeared to be relatively soundproof, and I barely heard the planes, so my sleep was quite restful",
            "The hotel was clean and comfy, staff very sweet and doing their best. If you are physically challenged in any way please call ahead to the hotel directly because you have to park in the parking garage on the 4th floor to get into the hotel from your paid parking spot, and there\\u2019s no way you\\u2019re getting a wheelchair in those doors, stairwell unless you can get out of your chair, lift your leg over large thresholds. It was difficult for persons walking with canes or a walker I'm sorry to say, including myself. Again, the hotel was clean, staff are friendly and helpful, good people."

            "Stayed here for 3 nights recently with two of my girlfriends and we had a fabulous time! We stayed in a two queen room which was plenty of space for the 3 of us and included a lounger and side tables. The toilet was separate from the shower\\u002Fsinks so it made getting ready easier. The bathroom counter is a bit small and there isn\\u2019t a ton of room - so give yourself lots of time for getting ready!  All of the staff were extremely friendly and the location is amazing! The city is so walkable from the hotel. The pool was amazing, the drinks were so good, and the staff were attentive and friendly. Only small complaint about the pool is that the food menu is extremely limited - hard for anyone with any dietary restrictions to eat! As the pool is right outside of Harriet\\u2019s rooftop it would make sense for the hotel to offer the same menu poolside!  Also\\u2026 adding a few more mirrors around the hotel and hotel rooms would be an appreciated extra touch!   Still despite all of this, 100% a 5 star experience and would stay again! It was the perfect getaway\\u2026 the mattress was sooo comfortable and I slept like a log each night",
            "I really enjoyed my stay, especially the perks like the complimentary tesla car service provided by Evolve Limousine & Rentals for guests, this service alone is great value and would certainly secure a future stay just for the added benefit of getting around the city (big thanks to Richard and Anthony).  I appreciate the small details ex. rock to show \\\"do not disturb \\\" and the berry water in the lobby, also love the text concierge service.  The espresso martinis from the lobby bar are delicious, special thanks to Beth for the quality service and DJ Kori Hall for a great Saturday night. The only constructive criticism I have is the rooftop pool - operations seems a bit unorganized, and guests of the hotel aren't necessarily prioritized over random walk-ins for the limited seating available. It was difficult to order a drink by the pool and I had to seek out a server several times for water, drink order and seating on the pool chairs. The service was excellent once I found a server and pool attendee (they were kind, polite and tried their best), but I felt like they were overwhelmed or lacked proper support\\u002Fdirection.  Would certainly recommend for single, female travellers, I felt safe and had a positive experience",
            "The room, and general atmosphere of the hotel, was serene, comfortable, and clean. The staff was very friendly and attentive, however the concierge services could have been more effective in some instances. For example, managing reservations at the restaurants within the hotel. The cleaning crew did an impeccable job tidying the room each day but room service fell short with providing requested items.  \\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed our stay but consider this a little lacking of a typical five star experience",
            "We chose 1Hotel for our stay because we had stayed there a few times before. The rooms are consistently clean, beautiful, cozy. \\n\\nAs we we left our room, a few members of the housekeeping team were outside and one of them (Martha) stopped us ans asked me how to pronounce my name, I told her and she said she was assigned to clean my room during my stay, she asked if I had any preferences or needed any additional items in my room. She was so pleasant and each time we ran into her she'd greet us by our names. She always refreshed the room quite a few times without prompting so each time we entered it seemed like we were arriving for the first time. It was definitely above and beyond service. \\n\\nI downloaded the app on my last stay and added preferences and noticed that on this visit there were a few added special features like a fruit platter and a nice note on our desk when we returned to the room that was personalized to me.\\n\\nWe also had friends stay and worked with Melida, Director Front Desk, to have each guest accommodated. Two guests decided to join last minute and she made arrangements for them the day before, honouring our rate and even getting the rooms on the same floor (two of them.were right beside us). \\n\\nOverall our stay with respect to rooms and booking was fantastic",
            "Lovely hotel in a great location. The bed was very comfortable and the stuff quite friendly. Attached to the hotel are some great restaurants, so traveling far for good food isn\\u2019t necessary. It was nice they included a Bluetooth speaker in the room so we could play some white noise at night. Hallway noise could be a little distracting for some. Valet was very helpful and the lobby a great place to hang out for live music and drinks in the evening",
            "Beautiful upscale boutique hotel with the coolest vibe. Amazing location in the entertainment district. From the time we checked in, Samantha (at front desk) made us feel welcome and at home. She went the extra mile to make sure that our accommodations were perfect and she prepared a list of restaurants that were some of the best we\\u2019ve ever experienced (and we are world traveler foodies). We will surely be back many times to Toronto and can\\u2019t wait to return to the 1 Hotel!! Awesome all around!",
            "Incredible stay, not long enough!  The sustainable design, vibe and convenient location just touches the surface of an incredible experience.  Customer care and service was outstanding.  Specifically, Helena\\u2019s personable and friendly demeanor was icing on the cake post delivery of her perfect libations tailored to delicious bar bites.  Fitness facility has it all and more.  Diverse and delicious menu items in on-site restaurants will not disappoint.  Rooms are well designed, very comfortable, and fitting for a leisure and travel accolade at minimum.  Will definitely revisit 1 Hotel Toronto and others in the brand.  Absolutely awesome",

Can\\u2019t wait to be bac",
            "This hotel is more than an ordinary 5 star hotel, and offers things which you can\\u2018t buy for money. Be it the  lovely and beautifully decorated sushi at the pool deck, Neil and Myra at the front desk with great advice, Ina from housekeeping performing a really impressive and immaculate turn down service, or the pool staff always finding a way to accomodate us. \\nOur double Queen room was nice and very quiet, although we desperately missed some more hooks  (the only real improvement potential). Outstanding towel quality, nicely designed towelling robes. \\nThe hotel location is good, the bar extremely nice, the fitness area very well equipped, and the restaurant 1 kitchen ok if you want an easy meal (good food but was nearly empty in the evening\\u002F portions partly very small\\u002F not competitive vs many other restaurants in the area). \\nAll in all: I would always pick this hotel again",
            "I had the good fortune of hosting a bachelorette at 1 Hotel last month and can't say enough good things about our experience! Immediately after we had booked our stay, I was contacted by our host, Brooklyn, who was incredibly personable, enthusiastic, professional and welcoming! Brooklyn went above and beyond to make our stay great, and went the extra mile by way of offering helpful tips on places to go and things to see. The rooms are beautiful, and the beds are so so comfortable. The location is excellent for a night on the town, steps away from some of the best restaurants and bars in the city. I hope to be back soon",
            "The customer service at 1 Hotel is second to none. As soon as we drove up to the entrance we were greeted by friendly and efficient valets who took care of our vehicle and luggage with a smile. The front desk staff was amazing and made sure we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. We made a few requests via text message and they were promptly responded to without question. After relaxing in our eco-concious rooom (gorgeous!) for a couple of hours, we headed down to Kitchen 1 for a delicious meal served by attentive staff who made sure we were well taken care of. After a comfortable sleep and luxurious shower, the check out experience was seamless and the front desk staff even took the time to send us off with a delicious coffee and tea. I can't say enough about this hotel and the amazing staff. Definitely consider 1 Hotel for your next visit to Toronto, the experience will exceed your expectations.",
            "Stayed two nights and it was beautiful.  The location is ideal for anyone wanting to experience downtown, the lobby was inviting and groovy.  Room was perfect.  Interior decor was inspired, and the bed soooo comfy.  Absolute brilliant staycation for us.  Would highly recommend and will certainly go back",
            "The most Beautiful Studio suite, with live plants, the wood decor, and everything thing just perfect. Felt like a magical forest retreat in the middle of the city. The care and ease of checking in and checking out, felt like coming home. \\nThank yo",
            "Everything was amazing.  This hotel really focuses on the little things.   For example, there was a yoga mat in the room and after the turn down service there was a robe laid out on my bed and a personalized \\u201CGood evening\\u201D note on the nightstand.  The staff are the friendliest I have ever seen.  Add in the incredible ambiance of this quaint little gem and you have a near perfect stay.  I couldn\\u2019t have been more delighted",
            "I was wondering if this location would live up to the Miami location and it definitely does. I am an avid traveler and a foodie, the 1 Hotel is definitely right up my alley. My girlfriend and I came to Toronto for a weekend getaway and I am SO happy we chose this spot.\\n\\nEvery single staff member, from the front desk, to the bartenders, to the pool service, to the housekeepers, EVERYONE was genuinely happy, attentive and so friendly. Making us feel right at home. \\n\\nThe food at the restaurants is absolutely delicious. Try the Bento Box up at the pool, it was the perfect lunch. Also stopped into the 1 Kitchen for a drink before dinner. The spicy marg was perfectly concocted. \\n\\nWe treated ourselves to a suite with a bathtub and it was SOOO relaxing. The perfect way to unwind after a long day. The gym was also very impressive. Literally every piece of equipment you could ever ask for. I don't usually hit the gym when I'm on vacation but I couldn't resist with the selection of clean and unique machines. \\n\\nThe decor of the entire hotel has always been very inspiring to me over the years. We have begun to recycle more and introduce more nature into our apartment after our visits at the various 1 Hotel locations. \\n\\nWhoever oversees this or manages the 1... PLEASE keep doing what you are doing with these hotels. \\nI look forward to seeing you again soon. \\n\\nSkyler",
            "We had a spacious studio suite on the 9th floor. Initial concerns over noise from construction across the street turned out to be unwarranted.  Highlights of our stay: the hotel restaurant was superb!!  A polished hand in the kitchen that was  on par with a fine dining establishment. \\n\\nFriendly staff  both in the hotel and the restaurant and not a whiff of attitude. Location was close to Farm Boy which meant easy access to breakfast and lunch goodies bought in advance and enjoyed later without having to leave the room.  Thor coffee on the next block was a jewel.  The bedding and the beds were fantastic. And the filtered tap water was great. \\n\\nThe only downside was the bar scene along King Street a couple of blacks away, that was noisy and crowded, not conducive to a relaxing evening strol",
            "Our 1 Hotel stay was exceptional!  We would like to thank Steven Dagenais who helped us get discounted corporate rates. He provided outstanding service and ensured that we were happy with all aspects of our visit!  Also, we had great assistance from Stephanie with finalizing the booking and she addressed any questions we had along the way. \\n\\nWe experienced 1 Kitchen for brunch and dinner, Flora Lounge for cocktails, Harriet's Rooftop for dinner and we also utilized room service for a meal!  The food and drinks are so fresh and delicious. We just loved all of it.\\n\\nThe rooms are so clean, unique and beautiful.  Sustainability was designed in everything from beautiful furniture, live plants everywhere and even the small items in each room.  \\n\\nThanks again to Steven, Stephanie and every single team member who were attentive, pleasant, happy and extremely quick to address all our requests!!",
            "Location is great for exploring Toronto.\\n\\nWe stayed as a family of 4 in two adjacent rooms (king and panoramic king). The rooms are spacious and decorated with a simple luxury, modern and sustainable vibe. Equipped with all you need including nespresso machines, hairdryers and irons!\\n\\nThe hotel even provided Dyson hair straighteners when my wife\\u2019s UK model would not work with the power supply (thank you!).\\n\\nBathrooms are well appointed with luxurious Bamford cosmetics.\\n\\nGood amenities including a gym, rooftop bar and pool.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the excellent 1 Kitchen breakfasts, but were unable to make the most of the very highly rated Casa Madera (which was booked out privately the only night we could make it \\uD83D\\uDE14) or the rooftop bar which closes very early Monday-Wednesday (1030pm). \\n\\nThe lobby bar was a great place for cocktails, with a chilled ambience and live entertainment.\\n\\nThanks to all the team for looking after us",
            "The 1Hotel team always raises the bar!  The atmosphere transports all guests into a sanctuary far  away from all the normal daily tasks and chores. \\n\\nThe rooms are designed to make you feel like you are one with nature with a beach not to far away. \\n\\nWe had the pleasure of dining at Harriet\\u2019s RoofTop for dinner. You can see almost a 360 of the toronto skyline. We ordered sushi, waygu, burrata and a multitude of mixed drinks. Nothing disappointed. \\n\\nWe also dined in for brunch and had their eggs Benny and focaccia French toast. All the flavours were amazing. Crazy enough the potatoes and in-house cured bacon stole the shop for me. \\n\\n1Hotel has definitely won me over from the other luxury resorts. They will become by home away from home from now on",
            "We stayed at 1 Hotel about a month ago, celebrating a special occasion, and from the moment I spoke with Chef Derek Powers and let him know, him and his team were BEYOND accommodating. I have some dietary limitations, and he went out of his way to select items I could eat, that were all DELICIOUS. We ate at the hotel a few times during our stay, and I was so impressed by the quality of the food and service - everything was fresh and I felt good about what I was eating. We saw Chef Powers a few more times during our stay and he really went out of his way to celebrate our special weekend, and was happy to offer us recommendations that suited our dietary needs. The room was also GORGEOUS... it felt new and clean and was incredibly comfortable. I also love the focus on sustainability. I really couldn't say anything but great things about our stay. Thank you Chef Powers and the 1 Hotel team for making our weekend one to remember",
            "We stayed at the 1Hotel last weekend (two rooms for two nights each). \\n\\nI'm not exactly sure how to rate our stay because lots of things went wrong, but the hotel also tried to make up for their missteps.\\n\\nLet's start with the good: this hotel is beautiful, landscaping is lovely, service is friendly, location is great, rooms are clean, and the gym is nice.\\n\\nNow the not-so-great: our room was double booked which we learned when someone with a key walked in on us, there was a $29 destination fee per room, per night (which nobody disclosed to us upon check in), one our rooms had frosted glass which was odd and meant that we couldn't see outside unless we craned our necks. \\n\\nAdditionally, everything we ate at the hotel was average at best Example: the avocado toast had some kind of premade spread instead of fresh avocado which wasn't tasty at all. \\n\\nIt goes without saying that this hotel is expensive so I had high hopes!\\n\\nLike I said, the hotel tried to make up for things by offering food and beverage credits (which we declined because we already had so many through the Amex FHR program). \\n\\nUltimately, they credited us the destination fees though, offered us another night on the house, and by their own volition credited one night back on one of the rooms. So 5 stars for their customer service!\\n\\nI'll likely give the hotel another try on my next trip...maybe we just came on an off weekend",
            "The venue was beautiful. I was a big fan of 1 Hotels. Unfortunately this place fell a bit short. There were a few issues that prevented the stay from being worth the amount spent to stay here. First we had a toilet issue all weekend. The water ran in the toilet all day and night making it hard to sleep. Staff tried multiple times to fix it but ultimately it was unsuccessful. I would have preferred they offer to move me to another room. And secondly, the hotel is rather loud. It seems this place is more for a party rather than luxury. We could hear lots of people on our floor until very late at night being loud. Also, the competition for the elevator at most times in the evening was a bit disappointing. You have to line up with party people trying to go to the rooftop to get in the elevator to go to your room. Besides all of that, the hotel is very stunning as you walk in, very impressive. Unfortunately though, this doesn\\u2019t feel like a 5 star resort. It\\u2019s more like an elevated 4 star hotel. In all fairness, the staff were very attentive and friendly",
            "We have stayed in many nice hotels in many cities around the world. We visit Toronto every summer. I can confidently say that 1Hotel Toronto might be our favorite hotel EVER. \\n\\nWe stayed for 3 nights recently and from start to finish the service just wowed us. In fact, even before we arrived I had been in close touch with Robin Elliot, the Chief Concierge, who was the essence of professionalism, kindness and helpfulness when it came to recommendations and requests. He certainly did not disappoint when we finally had the pleasure of meeting him in person, and for the duration of our stay. Robin made our trip so memorable, going the extra mile constantly to always make sure we were taken care of and happy - which we most definitely were. His warm and engaging personality, positive energy and authentic desire to help blew us away. All 4 of us couldn't stop talking about how wonderful this person is! And we are not usually a gushy family!! \\n\\nEveryone from the front desk staff to housekeeping to the folks at the restaurant\\u002Fbar (1 Kitchen is a fabulous place to eat btw - we had 2 excellent meals here) exemplified the 1Hotel brand - super friendly, positive, there to help you and ensure your stay is perfect. \\n\\nAside from the superior service level (which for me makes or breaks the vacation), the room was beautiful, the fixtures pristine, the bathroom just so beautiful. We don't typically love doorless showers when traveling with kids BUT this one was so tastefully done and in keeping with the natural, sustainable, eco-friendly theme of the hotel which we loved and appreciated that we didn't mind at all. The lobby and interior of the building was also just so gorgeous - reflecting the hotel philosophy oh-so stylishly. Gym was fantastic which both myself and my teen son frequented. \\n\\nWe left feeling so radiantly satisfied with our experience and thrilled that we have found, THE ONE, no pun intended! This will definitely be where we stay from now on, whenever we visit Toronto. We already can't wait for our next visit next summer, if not sooner",
            "I have stayed in my fair share of hotels and 1 Hotel Toronto is now one of my very favorites. The service, property, and amenities are impeccable. Brooklyn Lambert, the front office supervisor, and Robin Elliott, the chef concierge, both could not have been more helpful and such a pleasure to meet. They went above and beyond to make sure my son and I had a wonderful week at their hotel. The hotel is VERY enviromentally conscious. I have never stayed at a hotel where all of the water is filtered. Being able to fill up a water pitcher and have cold fresh water during our long stay was definitely a nice feature. \\n\\nAnd, the location can't be beat! They are just a couple of blocks off of King West and Queen West streets. Which means you are a short walk from a ton of restaurants and shops. The restaurants in the hotel are also all amazing! We ate at 1 Kitchen the majority of our time in Toronto! The hotel is also walking distance to the CN Tower and Rogers Centre, where the Blue Jays play. We walked to a game and were there in 15 minutes. In addition to the prime location they also have compimentary Teslas to take you places, within a certain distance from the hotel. There is also a grocery store a very short walk away.\\n\\nWe did take advantage of having a very nice gym and pool. If you have kids you need to be aware of the age limit for the pool. Even with the age limit, they were very accommodating for my 15 year old son to go to the pool during the day. There are personal trainers you can book time with, however I didn't have the opportunity to do that. \\n\\nI look forward to staying at any of the 1 Hotels. I certainly wouldn't stay anywhere else in Toronto. And, a huge thank you to Brooklyn and Robin for helping make my 50th birthday stay in Toronto wonderful",
            "We really enjoyed our friends trip to Toronto, and had an excellent time staying at the The One Hotel. The property was very clean, filled with light and I appreciated the additional attention to sustainability. The staff at the front desk was very helpful in offering recommendations for things to do and restaurants to visit. Especially Samantha",
            "We used the hotel as a retreat venue for our forum group.  From the moment you step in the lobby the atmosphere of green and relaxation envelops you.  The lobby had all kinds of great spaces to meet and connect with our group.  We used the lobby to do an impromptu meeting space. Our rooms opened out to a common space on the 3rd floor - it was beautiful weather so we also sat outside for one of our meetings.  All in all, the staff were welcoming and friendly.  Would recommend the accommodations as well as Casa Madera.",
            "I liked my room very much. It\\u2019s we\\u2019ll decorated and comfortable. These days hotels are not so much a place to lay your head, but a place you can immerse yourself in, to eat, hang out, exercise and enjoy yourself. They know this too, which is why they create the ambience they do. Hotels in all sorts of places; Rio, Tokyo; London; New York, have excellent hotels that grant you some level of exclusivity that come with staying at the hotel. They have a beautiful pool deck\\u002Flounge\\u002Froof top, well if you\\u2019re a guest, you are welcome to enjoy. If not a guest, you have to wait in line and maybe get in or not. At the 1 Hotel, not the case. You do not get access to the lounge; you do not get onto the rooftop; you are the same as anyone else even though you are paying $600 a night for a room. No exclusivity. I felt like I was just a person filling a bed. Coming back from dinner, it doesn\\u2019t matter if you want to enjoy a night cap. I found this very frustrating and it did not make me feel like a valued guest",
            "My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our four night stay at 1 Hotel. It is by far one of the finest hotels at which we've stayed over the years. The overall vibe throughout is calming and nature inspired. The large beautifully arranged lobby\\u002Flounge is where small bites can be ordered and live music enjoyed on weekends. We stayed in an upper level suite and loved the comfortable sectional sofa, having a shower and freestanding tub, and a window that opened for fresh air. The staff is committed to making it's guests feel appreciated and will do whatever it can to enhance their stay. Thank you Mira, for going above and beyond.  The concierge, Robin, was exactly who you'd hope for in any city. He is kind, respectful and very helpful. He suggested a local spa retreat and wonderful restaurants including Adrak, an elegant Indian restaurant with excellent food and over-the-top service. We have highly recommended 1 Hotel to our friends and will definitely return next year",
            "If I had been expecting a 4 star hotel with a cool concept I would have given a much higher rating.  However, I was expecting a 5 star hotel that claims to separate itself from the pack.\\n\\nThe hotel is \\u201Ccool\\u201D but the service level simply isn\\u2019t there.  And there are real design flaws that create some inconvenience and, frankly, less than a comfortable stay. \\n\\nSome examples: \\nI don\\u2019t know of any 5 star hotel that charges a $5 delivery fee on top of an 18% service fee for room service (a salad).  It\\u2019s not about the money- since $5 more added to the high room rate doesn\\u2019t make that much of a difference, but it comes across as very \\u201Cnickel and dime\\u201D and no frills in concept.\\n\\nThere are no doormen or attendants (outdoor or indoor) when you walk into the hotel which would be ok except that it\\u2019s hard to open a heavy wooden (eco friendly entry door) with a roller bag and backpack.  Again, not a 5 star experience. \\n\\nOnly one working elevator that looked like an elevator in an office building and the industrial carpet was visibly dirty over the 2 days that I was staying at the hotel.\\n\\nWalls are thin and I could hear the sounds of plumbing (water rushing through the pipes) all night while I was in bed.  The hvac seemed to have issues as well.  When I came in the room it was freezing and by midnight was stuffy and overheated despite multiple attempts to lower the temp.  It only cooled off in the morning. \\n\\nHeated floors in the bathroom, which is a nice touch, did not heat up in the 45 mins that I was getting ready in the bathroom.  I don\\u2019t know how long that should take.\\n\\nBiggest bathroom complaint: the half wall glass shower caused water to spray everywhere outside of the shower plus it\\u2019s freezing in a shower when you can\\u2019t enclose it.  \\n\\nActual food is 6 or 7 out of 10.  Had two meals and was not impressed.  Food didn\\u2019t need to be fancy but should be reliable and tasty at a 5 star hotel. \\n\\nWhen I left the hotel at 8 am looking to check out- the lobby was 100% empty with nobody at the desk or any place that I could see.  I left the cool wooden circle key on the counter and left.\\n\\nMy waitress at breakfast provided good service.l\\n\\nIt wasn\\u2019t a bad experience but I won\\u2019t be coming back.  The price paid vs value received was a mismatch.  There are several 5 star hotels in Toronto that do offer a fantastic experience and can command their rates",
            "I am not one to review. Normally I ignore the invites to do so but this group of individuals from 1 Hotel Toronto are absolutely awesome. My second stay, first was for business and second now for fun, I have to say I could tell the difference in how they personalize your stay. The Front Office Manager reached out to see if anything could do done to make this stay better so I was able to tell her about my wife joining. We were given a nice upgrade, a great return welcome and even the fine individuals in room service knew I was a repeat guest. I've been recognize before as a repeat traveller but this folks made it feel like home. You will know when you stay how you make a difference.\\nPros: The Staff, The Cleanliness the room, the location to queen st w, great texting service, sustainable impact\\nCons: Can be loud at night, doesn't bother me but woke up wife up a few times\\nTip: Harriets (rooftop) is not managed but the hotel but the Front Desk will try to get you in if you are a guest of the hotel. Haven't been disappointed yet. Loyalty is recognized",
            "What a transformation from the Thompson Hotel to now 1Hotel.\\nI thought Thompson was amazing, but 1Hotel has exceeded all my expectations.\\nFrom the moment you walk into the lobby, you feel like you're in a spa.  It's such a welcoming space and you just want to grab a seat and a drink and relax.\\nThe attention to detail and the commitment to sustainability is evident throughout the property.\\nIt's all the little touches that brings it all together.\\n5 stars all the way - I can't wait to go back",
            "I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at 1 Hotel Toronto. It\\u2019s location to the water, Queen street shopping and the Stackt market was convenient. The hotel lobby and my room offered a breath of fresh air from the noise and the busyness of the city. I was warmly welcomed by several of the staff. After a long period of travel that left me dehydrated and hungry, there was fresh fruit and flavored water to enjoy while I checked in. My room was an oasis of calm. Though I was street side, the noise didn\\u2019t penetrate the space and the interior design of the room made up for the lack of a view. Everything that the hotel offered that I took advantage of was a positive experience. I borrowed a bike and the concierge provided me with a safe and easy path to the bike path that runs along the water. After a long day, I decided to order room service for dinner. There were several excellent vegan, healthy options. The carrot soup was amazing. It was delivered by an extremely friendly staff person and in a timely manner. My room was equipped with a bathtub. The hotel provided bath salts so I decided to end the evening with a bath. It was a very calm environment and perfect way to end a busy day. The bathroom has everything anyone could need. The toiletries they provide are high quality and smell amazing. The hair dryer was also of high quality. It was a Dyson. I usually travel with my own hairdryer when I check luggage because the hotel hair dryers usually fry my hair. I recently stayed at a Ritz Carlton property assuming they would have a really good dryer but they surprisingly had a super cheap one that made my hair frizzy for the whole trip. Since I was only doing a carry-on, I left my hair dryer at home and was so excited to see that the 1 Hotel stocks their rooms with such a nice hair dryer. . Never underestimate the importance of these small details. The other cool feature of this hotel is that they have Tesla house cars that can take you places in the city within a certain radius. Even though I didn\\u2019t take advantage of this, it was nice to know that it was an option.",
            "Amazing experience from start to finish. Was warmly greeted and checked in by Mira who provided an extremely thorough overview of the hotel, how everything is sustainable, and aims to minimize waste as much as possible. The room was spacious, comfortable, and very clean. Bed was amazing. Gym was fantastic. Will definitely be staying here again",
            "Such a wonderful hotel. Rooms are so well organised, plenty of useful sockets and recharging points  (in the right places), spacious (we had a twin queen room for our family of four and it was very  comfortable). The hotel is eco- friendly and absolutely stunning inside. Everything was perfect, from the moment delightful Meera checked in us, to the hotel drop off at our hotel. It was so nice to come \\u2018home\\u2019 after a long day and debrief on the day\\u2019s activities with Meera! Robin the chef concierge and Demet (one of the house car drivers) were also stand out members of staff. A special place, with wonderful staff all round. Slippers are to die for, fresh fruit and refreshing coolers at reception are a nice touch. A few pointers: not so near to transport (the bikes and house car more than make up for that) but walking distance to Kettleman\\u2019s (great bagel shop\\u2026and lots of other eateries. Highly recommend all round",
            "No detail is spared when you stay at 1 Hotel. This is my second experience at a 1 Hotel property, and it just keeps getting better. Jonah, Shamar, and Omar at the front desk\\u002Fbell services were an incredible help to us each day. Maxine and Sabrina were wonderful in the Flora Lounge. The danish and breakfast options in Flora Lounge were fantastic. Lunch at 1 Kitchen was extra fresh and the Aperol Spritz bar was so fun. We visited the Rooftop and my goodness, the views are incredible and the ambiance is unmatched. The rooms are impeccable and their commitment to sustainability at every point in your stay is truly remarkable. How do we get more hotels to be like 1 Hotel?",
            "This is a MUST stay when in Toronto.  Just walk through the front doors and you feel (and smell) the calmness in the air.  The staff is always friendly and helpful, the service throughout the hotel is top notch. Just look around and you\\u2019ll see they take sustainability seriously. Salvaged wood from locations around the city, many of which is marked with where it came from.  And the greenery throughout really adds a cozy touch.  The restaurants are great too, be sure to grab breakfast at 1Kitchen, the Avocado Tartine never disappoints.  And don\\u2019t miss Casa Madera, it\\u2019s not just a wonderful meal, it\\u2019s an experience!  Our stay at 1 Hotel never disappoints, looking forward to returning when we are back in the city",
            "I booked a suite for the night before our wedding and our wedding night. It was spacious and airy and had all the comforts of home. The kitchen had dishes and glassware and the bedroom had a portable speaker which came in handy to play music while the bridesmaids got their hair and make up done in the morning. Love the focus on sustainability (I don\\u2019t think anything was in plastic packaging or came in a plastic bottle) and recycling. The location is great and so close to transit and King West restaurants, though there\\u2019s plenty of dining options onsite as well. Would highly recommend this hotel (and we didn\\u2019t even get to use all the amenities!).",
            "I recently stayed at this incredible hotel in Toronto and was thoroughly impressed by their strong focus on sustainability. The diversity in their food and beverage offerings is remarkable, catering to all tastes with a global flair. The rooftop vibe is unbeatable, with stunning views of the city that create the perfect atmosphere for a night out. The employees are warm and hospitable, making every guest feel special, and the management's presence in the lobby and restaurants adds a personal touch to the experience.The trendy crowd and the lively atmosphere make this the place to be in Toronto. Plus, considering the prime location, the pricing is very fair compared to other downtown hotels. Without a doubt, this is the best hotel and restaurant in Toronto. I can't wait to come back",
            "1 Hotel is probably one of the nicest hotels I've stayed in! From the furniture to the food, everything has been thought out from start to finish. The customer service team is very attentive, and the plants in the hotel add such a gorgeous, fresh touch. Highly recommend staying here",
            "Very accommodating on my adjusted arrival and departure times. The woody, clean, and sustainable design of my room made feel very comfortable. \\n\\nA few cool small things that are unique: I liked their \\u201Cdo not disturb\\u201D sign being made of a rock; they also have a wood tab that lets you leave things behind for donation in case you brought too many things. \\n\\nRooftop pool was very inviting with towel service and drinks. \\",
            "Our connecting flight from Toronto to NYC was canceled and we were stranded for a few days. We arrived exhausted and miserable about our plight, but all that turned around within minutes of walking into this hotel. We\\u2019re checking out two days later and are almost sad to leave. \\n\\nThe staff are welcoming and highly attentive, the hotel room is beautiful and well designed, and the hotel bars and restaurants are terrific (though not cheap). The entire hotel is an aesthetic delight!There is a heavy focus on environmental sustainability, from using only recycled wood throughout the building to providing a lobby fruit stand containing less than perfect but perfectly edible fruit that would otherwise have been discarded at grocery stores. We did not use the gym or pool but we were told the gym includes Peloton bikes. Judging from the rest of the place, I\\u2019m sure both are gorgeous. Our studio room with a king size bed is spacious, very clean and bright, and well appointed with a Nespresso maker, tea, filtered tap water and snack bar. The bathroom is gorgeous and has a rainfall shower head and the shower gel, shampoo and conditioner smell heavenly. Even the hair dryer is much better than average.\\n\\nThe hotel is located in the fashion district, and although there is a lot of construction going on, it offers some nice dining options within walking distance. The hotel\\u2019s restaurants (including rooftop restaurant) are popular with non-guests of the hotel, so that tells you something. Plus, the hotel offers free Tesla rides within a 4 km radius, which gets you to several key areas such as downtown. \\n\\nIn short, we love this place and we hope to have an opportunity to come back. In fact, we already asked if we can come back if our flight tonight is canceled. Again",
            "When ever I travel to Toronto I typically stay at the Hazelton or the Fairmont but I decided I wanted to try something new and stay at the 1 Hotel.. and let me tell you I was not disappointed. I was blown away not only by how luxurious this eco friendly hotel is but also the exceptional service I received. I dined at Harriet's and Casa Madera and had some of the best dining experiences that I can remember. The guests service manager Kristy gave me her personal contact information and was so attentive to all of my needs. If you're looking for luxury, comfort, good food, incredible atmosphere, and phenomenal services this is the spot for you",
            "We decided to try the 1 Hotel Toronto for a theatre weekend because it was close to folk we wished to visit.  We were pleasantly surprised by by everything about the hotel from its helpful friendly staff to the emphasis on environmental sustainability.  They even arranged ground transportation to theatre which is a little further away than we were prepared to walk.  We'll be back.",
            "1Hotel is an awakening of the senses. From the minute you walk in, you can\\u2019t help but to  feel like you have entered a sanctuary within the city. You can\\u2019t help but to take in all the plants, natural elements and signature scent to set the mood for a relaxing stay. My husband and I stayed in room 319 and it was beyond our expectations. The room was spacious and had a walk out terrace. The bathroom has heated floors and the concrete bathtub was as luxurious as they come. The Bamford products are now my new favourite. We loved all the attention to detail in our room to help make our stay feel like home. Everyone was super friendly and attentive from the front desk to the valet. The hotel has a beautiful roof top restaurant and pool with great views of the city. The lounge is beautiful and the cocktails amazing, especially their old fashion. The gym is well appointed with everything you need including Peloton bikes. We had a fabulous breakfast at 1Kitchen and we loved that they had gluten and dairy free options. We highly recommend this hotel- nothing big chain and impersonal about it",
            "i was recommended to this hotel by a colleague who had stayed here previously.\\nmy wife and I were not disappointed. we are very environmentally conscious and everything this hotel stands for aligns with us and our views, which made the choice in booking here a non-given. we were not able to go up to Harriet's but enjoyed a few great cocktails at Flora lounge before heading out for dinner. there had been a couple of issues with my booking but Samantha at the front desk was very quick to assist us. she was polite and professional and was attentive to our needs. she also gave us some suggestions of things to do around the city and we had a great time visiting. we look forward to staying here again in the future. hopefully for a longer stay next tim",
            "This hotel was genuinely so amazing from the second you walked through the doors into the lobby.  Every part of the decor was so thoughtfully placed, and the focus on sustainability and bringing new life to otherwise scrapped materials was so great to see in a hotel.  The service was very efficient and easy to contact, as you could through texting the front desk, and not to mention incredibly kind and thoughtful. The room was so beautiful and felt really homey, and was a great way to spend a couple days away for an anniversary. Oh, and the food was really great. I still think about that avocado toast more often then I'd like to admit. Thank you for such a great experience 1 Hotel, looking forward to my next stay",
            "The 1 Hotel is a perfect execution of luxury sustainability. With a full gym and classes available to experience. Great restaurants and a rooftop with a 360 view!! They also have a house car for transportation within the area, but most of the hot spots are within walking distance of the hotel",
            "The hotel promotes itself as a luxury hotel but the service is poor and it\\u2019s amenities are lacking.  If you ask about the hotels amenities, menus or services most staff won\\u2019t know the answer or worse, will simply make up an answer.  When asked if a house car was available and we were told that they didn\\u2019t know when it would be available or if it would be available.   As we walked out the door there were two house cars out front (30 steps from the person who had no idea when they would be available) that were empty and waiting to take guests wherever they needed to go.  \\n\\nThe hotel itself is beautiful and tastefully decorated but staying there is like giving the keys of a Ferrari to a someone learning to drive.   They don\\u2019t appreciate what they have, they have no idea how to use it, and so they can\\u2019t help others to enjoy it.  \\n\\nThe hotel was opened in August 2021 and promotes sustainability.  They even use Teslas as their house cars.   One small problem with this is that if you actually drive a Tesla (or any EV) you can\\u2019t actually charge it at this hotel.   Most luxury (and even standard) hotels have at least a few electric chargers at this point as automakers roll out more electric cars but this \\u201Ceco\\u002Fsustainable\\u201D hotel has exactly zero chargers.  It\\u2019s actually shocking (no pun intended). \\n\\nThe night life in the main lobby and roof was lively and had a \\u201Cclub\\u201D feel but if you want to experience real luxury and the service that comes from staying in a luxury hotel you may want to try the Ritz, Park Hyatt, Four Seasons, or one of the many other fine hotels in Toronto.  We wanted to give this one a try as we liked the whole sustainability concept but the service was a real let down and we won\\u2019t be back",
            "This was one of the nicest hotels we've ever stayed in. The rooms are incredibly comfortable, every design and function decision was made with true sustainability in mind, and the service is 10\\u002F10 (shoutout to Adrian). Highly recommend staying here",
            "What an awesome, beautiful eco-friendly hotel with amazing interior decor. Would definitely stay here again! I want to check out the one in LA and NY. This hotel came recommended by coworkers who have stayed here before"

            "Had no idea what to expect for an uptown hotel, but this was a sheer delight. The staff were very welcoming even though we were late due to flight delays. The room was very clean and the decor had a wonderful quirky vibe almost straight out of 1920's film noir set. Valet service was excellent. Both guys we talked to were very friendly. Had breakfast here every morning, only small selection, but designed to fulfill all the necessary food groups to fil you up for the rest of the day. Didn't eat here in the evening as there were so many other restaurants nearby to choose from. It is located one block from the Metro Line 1, so easy to get downtown and 2 blocks from all the major car hire firms rental collection and return depot under the shopping mall.\\n\\nWould recommend this to anyone",
            "Stayed in a King Loft Room. The style of the hotel is really nice - sort of quirky\\u002Findustrial with lots of nice touches in the room including the record player. The room is a pretty good size (used the space well), the 2 armchairs and table were a nice bonus and and bed was big and comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly and the bar area is really nice. \\n\\nThe main let down was the location in terms of it being noisy and a little on the rough side. Its near a main road (Yonge Street) and the windows don't offer much sound proofing. We were also next to the lift which made it noisy. Its also a bit of a walk from the main parts of Toronto. \\n\\nSo overall it was good but think where your room is located is important and important to consider where you want to be near. Our room was on a high floor which was great but west facing which had a city view but also made it noisy",
            "Stayed one night with family. Homeless encampment outside made me nervous. Valet parking cost $45, Public parking garage over the road cost $27 for 14 hours. Nearby MacDonalds and Tim Hortons for breakfast. Very downtown vibe with all the riff-raff around. The room itself was clean and quiet. Room card needed to activate the elevator so that kept undesirables out",
            "Positives: the front desk staff was friendly and helpful, the room was comfortable and housekeeping was immaculate.  Terrific location.\\n\\nNegative: the hotel restaurant does not serve breakfast, and that fact was not disclosed when I made my reservation or when I checked in.  A Starbucks-like coffee shop in the hotel serves coffee and rolls, but that is it.  At rates as high as these, the lack of breakfast is a serious shortcoming",
            "I was a bit hesitant about booking The Anndore House, knowing it was once a Comfort Inn \\u2013 a brand and physical older building I wouldn't typically choose. But after reading the reviews and seeing the photos of what Hyatt has done, I decided to give it a shot, and I\\u2019m so glad I did! From the moment I arrived, everything was fantastic. The hotel has a fun vibe\\u2014small, cozy, and boutique without feeling cramped. Check-in was a breeze, and I was pleasantly surprised by the size of my room. It was unexpectedly large, beautifully designed, and incredibly clean\\u2014honestly, one of the cleanest hotel rooms I\\u2019ve stayed in. Everything worked perfectly, and the bed was extremely comfortable.\\n\\nThe location, while a little further north than I needed, was just a quick subway ride away from the main spots. Even as a first-time visitor to Toronto, the TTC was easy to navigate, with the nearest station just a short walk away. The street itself has a few questionable spots, but it\\u2019s clear that the area is evolving, with newer restaurants and stores popping up.\\n\\nI enjoyed the restaurant and its overall vibe, as I ate there for breakfast each morning. The people were great, and breakfast was good, but I had a couple of very minor issues. The buffet selection, while good, was a bit limited. Additionally, the weekend breakfast hours were a bit odd\\u2014brunch started later, so I had to miss the sit-down breakfast altogether as I was heading to the airport. Fortunately, the quick cafe staff were super accommodating and made me a fresh menu item, but I do feel that a consistent breakfast schedule throughout the week would make more sense.\\n\\nAll in all, I couldn\\u2019t have asked for a better stay. I highly recommend The Anndore House and would absolutely stay here again",
            "Enjoyed our 1-night stay at this hotel. Staff were friendly and helpful, rooms were as advertised. I was disappointed at first there there were no robes or slippers in the room, but discovered that I could call and request these \\u2014 among other items \\u2014 from the front desk. \\n\\nWe were on the 9th floor. Noise travelled through the ceiling from people walking above us, but it was not that disruptive. \\n\\nOverall, it was a lovely overnight getaway in a hotel with some unique character.",
            "An incredible stay, within walking distance of yorkville. The hotel entrance was only accessible my room key after 10:00 which made the hotel feel incredibly safe and the rooms were stunning. Unlike any hotel I\\u2019ve been to before. I would stay there again in a heartbeat",
            "Evie at check in was as sweet as pie; off to a good start! The room was excellent, everything you could ever need, quiet even though it\\u2019s situated right downtown, great bed, mini fridge, bathroom to die for and the decor just hip enough without going over the top.  Very classy; even had a Smeg kettle for morning tea.\\n\\nWe decided to have drinks and nibbles and the host at the restaurant suggested we go upstairs to the upper patio..awesome.!  A few floors up a huge patio surrounded by lush greenery and mature trees muffled the noise and made for a very pleasant cocktail and appetizer experience.  Duck mousse, hummus and the burger all excellent.  I can\\u2019t remember what it was called but it\\u2019s a cocktail with lavender in the ingredients...I\\u2019d go back just to have one.  \\n\\nA really nice surprise, great service in a non pretentious establishment yet stylish and welcoming ...thanks for a wonderful stay",
            "Loved my stay at the Anndore House - despite it being a sad occasion for my visit. A big room in a modern industrial chic style with comfy bed and a great staff on the front desk made it a perfect experience. Did not get tired of my room despite staying 24 nights",
            "I stayed at Anndore House whilst visiting my family in Toronto. My room was large, but sparse, with a malfunctioning television and toilet. I was advised when I arrived that all hotel amenities were closed due to COVID and nothing was on offer to compensate. Instead of a coffee maker there were instant coffee packets. The nice looking bar was closed and no alcohol was in the room, complimentary\\u002Fcompensatory or otherwise, and the only food on premises was $5 glass jars of gummies. Perhaps at another time this would be a nice place to stay, but compared to other hotels I\\u2019ve stayed at in North America and abroad that I have stayed at during the pandemic, this stay was my worst",
            "I booked this hotel - king size bed (on the hotel\\u2019s actual website (no 3rd party website)) Got to the hotel and the front desk went on to tell me that there were no king sized rooms available and that they were sold out of this room days ago. I expressed that I specifically booked a king but there was nothing she could do. Put us in a handicapped room to boot! No leather club chairs like shown on the website. Very disappointing for what we paid! \\n\\nFunny thing is a while later, while walking through the front lobby, we overheard  her informing the new arrival the same thing she told us. Hmmm ?",
            "The Anndore House is a short couple of blocks from the landmark intersection of Yonge and Bloor Streets, and was previously the shabby Comfort Hotel. Hyatt took over the building, hired a decorator who thinks dark brown with black accents is a cheerful colour scheme for hotel rooms, and installed a restaurant and bar in most of the ground floor space. They also doubled the room rates, which still leaves them lower than other midtown hotels. The Anndore seemed clean, staff were helpful when I needed a couple of small things, and somehow, amazingly, the Comfort Hotel room doors that used to close with a jarring crash have been softened somewhat. However, practically everything in the room seemed badly arranged (awkward bathroom, tiny strange light switches, duvet suitable only for short people) and the bar didn\\u2019t seem to be open any time I wanted to make use of it. Your experience may be better, as long as you have the arm strength to open the huge heavy entrance doors. Also, watch out for the little slope in the floor right in front of the elevator",
            "Good hotel but parking is separate parkade across the street.  Hotel is not well marked.  Rooms are well finished but some are dark painted all brown, other rooms brighter with white shutters and wall. Restaurant is good. Staff is great which I think trumps all else",
            "I had to extend my stay by two nights due to a flight change. I emailed the hotel to inform them of the two night extension. \\nWhen checking in, I was told that the two extra nights would be discounted as I had opted to stay in my original room and the two night extra were of a higher rate. \\nWhen checking out, I was abruptly informed that there would not be a discount as I opted to stay in the original room \\nVery dissatisfied with the way this was dealt with and also being given false information",
            "My recent stay at The Anndore House in Toronto was a perfect blend of contemporary chic and urban comfort. The hotel\\u2019s location in the trendy Yorkville neighborhood provided a stylish retreat while being within walking distance of Toronto\\u2019s cultural attractions. My room was a haven of modern elegance, with sleek design and all the amenities I needed. The central location allowed me to explore Toronto\\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods, from Yorkville to Kensington Market. Dining at the hotel\\u2019s restaurant, Constantine, was a culinary adventure, with a menu that celebrated global flavors and creative dishes. The Anndore House exceeded all my expectations, and I eagerly look forward to my next visit to this stylish gem in Toronto",
            "We stayed at the Anndore House for 3 nights in in July 2022.  The hotel itself was clean and modern though the rooms are a bit small.  The best thing about the hotel is the location,  It is in close walking distance to the metro, buses, shopping and restaurants.  The worst thing about the hotel is also the location.   Being in the heart of downtown, the streets are filled with many homeless people, litter, etc.  It's not to the point that we felt unsafe, but quite uncomfortable",
            "Rooms could be cleaner, in-room amenities could be improved & rooms could use an update. Great location, comfy beds, fair price for proximity to Yorkville. Although rooms not super clean, housekeeping staff were pleasant & helpful.",
            "Nothing beats coming back to a comfortable bed and relaxing in a space that is more like a city studio apartment (fridge no microwave) than a boring hotel room.  Wished that in-house restaurant Constantine had been open for dinner  during our stay, but finding dining options nearby was never a problem.   Lots of food options to fit most everyone\\u2019s taste and budget within walking distance along Bloor and Yonge.  Just watch your step along Yonge street, Toronto is not immune to the urban homeless problems that plague other cities like SF and NYC. Front desk and housekeeping staff were friendly and great at what they do. Public parking across the street from Anndore was convenient and taking the TTC at Bloor\\u002FYonge station was a breeze because it was so close to the hotel.  Overall, great place to stay",
            "The Anndore House was a great place to stay and a chnage from normal brand hotels. Although it is part of a very large brand didn't feel like it. The restaurant stays open until 11pm which was good for us as we arrived at 8-45pm from Vancouver and this meant we could get a good meal without having to go out. The rtestaurant was so good that when we arrived back from out Niagara Falls trip at 7pm the following day we decided to eat in th restaurant again",
            "Location is ideal for touring Toronto. Clean, unique, pleasant decor in our room.  We slept very well in the comfy bed and as far as the windows go, if you open the wooden shutters there are blackout roll down blinds.  Very modern conveniences in the room.    Staff are friendly. Get a Citypass. Visit Casa Loma. Take the subway. Only one block away.   This hotel was a great decision for us!   And the dining room is divine. Constantine's is an amazing experience.  Three nights stay on the top floor of an exceptional boutique hotel. You will not be disappointed.  Thank for helping my daughter and I make memories.",
            "I was hesitant about booking this hotel because I knew so little about it, but the stay was really nice (except for the crappy Satellite TV service during the height of the closing days of the Olympics!!!).  The rooms hve false brick walls with cool artwork, a fake rotary phone and an old-school vinyl record player!  That was a lot of fun to play with and took me back to my childhood.  The hotel is in the Yorkville neighborhood which is near Downtown Toronto as well as a homeless shelter (two doors down to the right -- so go left!).  It's also near a Tim Horton's and two strip clubs, so something for every member of the family!  I never felt unsafe there -- they lock the doors after 10pm, so the strippers don't get in- so don't forget your card key.  If you book on points, choose the valet service -- it's free.  Just give a tip.  Overall, a nice stay and I would reconsider if they FIX THE SATELLITE TV!!!",
            "Very boutique hotel with a wonderful theme to it. Staff was incredibly helpful and pleasant whenever we needed anything. Room was clean and comfortable. \\n\\nWould certainly recommend a higher floor level if possible as even on the 8th floor, street level traffic could be heard. This is likely due to the thinner windows but it wasn\\u2019t unbearable. \\n\\nConvenience wise, it\\u2019s right across the street from reasonably priced municipal parking and a 3-5min walk from the subway station which makes things very convenient. \\n\\nWe had only two notable downsides. First would be that it\\u2019s very close to a shelter which means the adjoining street may appear less appealing however we were never bothered by anyone. This is by no means the fault of the hotel itself but is of note. The second was that the air conditioning unit was quite loud and rattled a lot. This could be due to it starting to age out\\u002Ffail.\\n\\nWould certainly book again",
            "Really nice hotel in a great location. Rooms have clearly been recently refurbished and we really liked the decor. Even standard rooms are very spacious with space for 2 good sized chairs and table in between the bed and TV. Our room faced out onto a green space and hence was very peaceful. Shower could have been a little more powerful, but otherwise a faultless stay",
            "Awful location in sketchy neighbourhood with homeless sleeping nearby with shouting clanging of dumpster life and noise at night and early morning. Hotel tested fires alarms and carelessly broadcast loud radio static through the PA system that made out room uninhabitable. Video display system had no movies or even access to Netflix or streaming platforms. No decent coffee making capability in the room. Only parking option was expensive valet service. Never going back",
            "This hotel is in a great location for exploring downtown Toronto.  \\n\\nThe beds are comfy and the room is nice but the air con is really noisy, and this observation is based on us travelling over the last 3 months and staying in a lot of hotels.\\n\\nThe ladies at reception said that \\u201Csome people were too sensitive\\u201D and that if I turned the air con off at night that might help.  \\n\\nWhen we asked to move rooms their first question was - have you messed up your room?  Not, really customer focussed.  \\n\\nThe second rooms AC was a bit quieter but it is still a really noisy system. \\n\\nIn the second room - which was supposed to be quieter there was a letter from the manager apologising for the construction noise next door and two sets of ear plugs",
            "A chic boutique hotel located in downtown Toronto.  The room got this retro feeling to it. love the little details and how they spend the time to decorate the room with a vinyl player but sadly, the vinyl records are all scratched up so you can't really enjoy it.  Overall a decent stay while parking across the street is abit pricey",
            "Room was unique and clean.  I had a problem with the excessive fees and tax es and on top that  an 85$ a night for pet fee which i wasn't informed until i arrived at this so called pet friendly hotel.  The fees and pet upcharge doubled price of the room and parking is very expensive.   We chose city parking across the street.  I wouldn't return based on the upcharges are way too much.   No pool or any resort type amenities to justify those resort\\u002Ftax fee and highest pet fee ive ever encountered and I travel alot with my dog.  There response was indifferent.   Just states we are charging your credit card on file.",
            "Rooms at the Anndore house were modern and spacious enough. All amenities provided were working and appreciated: from the record player, pipe exposed faucets, lighting fixtures, fridge, rainfall shower, light controls and so on. Parking in the garage of the hotel is complimentary only for Hyatt Globalist Members. Check in was simple, granted early check in and early check out from the hyatt mobile app. Hotel was sold out for Sunday night but its as if you did not have any issues with crowding. My only comment is regarding the elevator - can be slow at times. \\n\\nA Big thank you and gratitude to Momiji Kishi of the HotBlack Coffee shop in the lobby of this hotel who was simply amazing and professional to make the breakfast experience phenomenal. I had a very early checkout and she was able to accomodate the breakfast situation for all guests as we would be leaving before her coffee shop would open. She was very personable and her breakfast is simply delicious. Don't miss out on her cold brew coffee, green\\u002Forange juices, sourdough egg sandwich, strawberry and banana bread sweets \\uD83E\\uDD70 i would return here on a future stay\\n\\",
            "The hotel has a nice modern design but that is the only positive. Conveniently located right next to the hotel (25 feet) is an active crackhouse full of junkies. Imagine a movie scene and multiple that by 10 and that\\u2019s what you have. I\\u2019ve travelled the world staying in thousands of properties and never seen anything like this. We were even lucky enough to have been provided a low floor room (we paid for a high floor) with a direct view of the crackhouse. My children had a few questions  to say the least. \\n\\nAdd to that terrible snarky service during check-in and \\u201Cvalet\\u201D parking service  that does not operate during off-peak hours.  This is a terrible property and should be avoided",
            "Many hotels in downtown Toronto resemble each other.  I was looking for a funkier place.  I certainly got that at the Anndore House.  Staff was welcoming.  Bar area is comfortable and one can also have access to full restaurant menu there.  Menu was lovely as were the drinks choices.  Room are fun to look at and practical as well.  Decoration and style is interesting.  Well situated also",
            "I picked this hotel based on the photos and location. Very cute boutique hotel. Upon arrival I was notified that valet parking is NOT complimentary contrary to what is stated on the website. The phone number on the website says it\\u2019s out of service so it was hard for me to find a number to contact before I arrived. I was not greeted as a Hyatt member nor was I greeted with any above average hospitality considering how much I payed to stay for one night. Rooms are cute, but you can tell they are built cheaply. Cheap bed and pillows, my bed at quality inn the night before was comfier. I was excited to put on Netflix and chill for the night before the following day of travel I had. I messed around with the tv for over an hour to try and connect my phone which I then realized wasn\\u2019t compatible with iPhone. As stated on a list of complimentary things in my room, I called down to the lobby to get a chrome cast set up to my room. They said chrome cast isn\\u2019t working due to tvs being updated but offered an HDMI for a laptop ( which I did not have). I asked how the hdmi would be any different than a chrome cast and they didn\\u2019t have an answer for me. I asked them to please just bring it up for me to try. I got it, plugged it in. It said not enough power because of a unknown power source. It was an iPhone block instead of the google chromecast original power block. This is why it didn\\u2019t work. I was also uninformed until much later that there were even TV channels available. Once I got to the channels it was very limited. Yes this is a rambling review but to think in 2023, paying over $300 to stay in a hotel, I could watch something other than cable. After asking what they were going to do to make this matter right for me they offered me breakfast. Unfortunately the timeframe didn\\u2019t work for me to have it so no comment on that. There are no other amenities in this hotel. Truly a 3 star or less stay. Staff were not very nice at all. Not rude per say, but didn\\u2019t make sure you felt welcomed or valued. Spend your money elsewhere,  stay at a 3 star like the Alt or Marriott.",
            "Excellent experience. \\nThe room is clean with a very trendy decor. \\nThe hotel is ideally located (Bloor-Yonge subway station 2 minutes walking or Green P parking on the other side of the street)\\nStaff is providing an excellent service. \\n\\",
            "Stayed at the Anndore as Toronto entered stage 3 of COVID-19 restriction-easing. There were no amenities, but the design of the hotel definitely made up for any missing features. Small touches like the early 20th century telephones and brass bathroom and shower taps made our stay very memorable. And the Constantine restaurant upper patio was perfect, with the tree branches and hanging lights creating a cozy ambiance",
            "I have stayed in various hotels in Toronto and Anndore has by far the nicest room. The decor is retro + industrial and is exactly like shown on their website (less the flowers).\\nThe staff is friendly and helpful. Special shout out to Augusto at the front desk for the nice warm welcome and helpfulness. It really gave a first awesome impression of the hotel. Room cleaning staff is also very helpful and responsive for missing items from the room.\\nInside the room, spacious walkin closet and sitting area with style. Lots of well-organized cupboards and shelf space throughout the room you can move your own whole bedroom in here.\\nSome people commented on the safety outside of the hotel. It's downtown in a big city and what more needs to be said?\\nAs for other people complaining about the thin walls and noise from other rooms. I also did not find any problem. Yes you can hear some noise from the hallway but it's not different than what I have experienced in other hotels.\\nThere is no gym or swimming pool but I knew it before I booked.\\",
            "We were pretty disappointed with our one night stay at the Anndore House. Based on reviews and the hotels\\u2019 marketing it comes across as a boutique luxury property and while although there are some nice touches, it really falls short. \\nRooms are very small with standard rooms being under 300sqft and upgraded rooms under 400.\\nOnly one (small) elevator was working during our stay and the elevator consistently took awhile.\\nWalls were very thin and we could hear people in the next room\\u002F hallways continuously.\\nStaff were basically non existent. No luggage assistance, bare minimum communication at check in, etc. \\nBath gels\\u002F shampoo were in large bottles but were all almost empty which was disappointing. \\nAs a Hyatt Globalist there were essentially no benefits. \\u201CBreakfast\\u201D is a joke and includes a muffin and a coffee at the attached coffee bar. For a Hyatt jdv property this is really disappointing. \\nOnly reason 2 stars is that we found the bed comfortable, the retro decor interesting and the location was convenient for us. \\nOverall, if you like overpriced \\u201Cboutique\\u201D hotels on Younge street then go for it, but if you want to actually enjoy your $300+ experience, go elsewhere",
            "On Thursday I booked a room for Friday night using one of the major third party booking sites. Got my confirmation and I was all set for a quick break. I arrived Friday was at the reception, nobody was saying anything lots of scurrying around, the person who was helping me left, keep in mind there was no handover they just left, and then the new person just looked at me \\u201Cit\\u2019s funny we\\u2019ve been out of that room for a week, sorry we can\\u2019t honour your reservation.\\u201D Nothing further added, yes this is a $400 a night hotel experience. I asked a couple questions but was told \\u201Csorry, third party booking, nothing I can do.\\u201D I felt like I was being guilted for using a large third party booking site the day before - curious I wasn\\u2019t aware I decided the hotels business partnerships. It reminded me of the computer says no UK comedy sketch. I continued to ask questions, can I get one night, this they could do. Imagine if I had flown in this hotel has no problems just letting you fend for yourself. So I booked for one night, no discounts or anything, I asked again let me get this straight you\\u2019re doing nothing, no credit, nothing? \\u201CSorry, beyond my control, but the manager can contact you.\\u201D The manager did quickly reach out and then was able to fully accommodate my two night booking, in a different room. I understand mistakes happen, but when they have, without asking quality establishments take steps, offer you a discount, all I got was my original booking at full price in a downgraded room - and I only got that because I pushed back, this high end hotel was ready just to abandon me. Never again",
            "The room was immense compared to other hotels I\\u2019ve stayed in. Rooms were cleaned daily with fresh towels, ceramic mugs *as opposed to paper cups for coffee* and fun touches like a little record player with a few LPs, mini fridge.  Bathrooms and closets were huge and there was lots of room to lounge and sleep.  Great beds and comfortable nights.\\nConvenient to many theaters and museums and nightlife",
            "Great experience, we are in hotels regularly during our Covid summer vacation and we alcohol wipe all surfaces and high touch areas in our rooms upon entry.  This place tops all of the 4 and 5 star places we visited, our white wipes remained white after the job on all surfaces including shelves.  The Cavalli faucets, separate WC shower and sink dressing areas are great, professional lighting and industrial decor, very nice.  Plus they welcome our little fury travel companion with reasonable fee and not assigning a rundown room for it, beautiful",
            "The room was super cute with an old-fashioned with a rustic-industrial feel. \\nThe room was clean and well decorated, and the houskeeping and room service was on point. \\nHowever, the faulty lights in the room kept turning on and off at random (sometimes in the middle of the night). At one point it was so bad I had to call the front desk about them turning on and off every 30 seconds. To which the woman at the front desk replied \\\" there's no one here to fix it until 3pm.\\\" Another thing was that the hotel advertised their rooms as being soundproof. Totally untrue...any noise from a neighbouring room or from the hallway would easily wake you up.\\nAside from that the over-all stay was great and super close to all the action and Pride festivities. They just need to fix the stupid lighting systems in the rooms.\\n\\",
            "The hotel is nice but you can hear the noise from the hallway and stairwell. The properties surrounding the Anndorr were also full of garbage, not nice at all. The only park for my dogs was fenced off, despite paying 150.00 for their stay had to ask twice for dog beds and bowls. Despite being a discoverist in the world of Hyatt program, had to beg for a better room although the note was there for an upgrade. They did accommodate early check-in and late checkout",
            "This hotel is truly a hidden gem in the middle of bustling downtown Toronto. The rooms are beautifully decorated with thoughtful details, and it was surprisingly family friendly (travelled with a 2.5 year old and she loved it!) Central location close to all the major transit lines, but the hotel itself felt like a cozy oasis away from the buzz of the city. I'd stay here 100 times over",
            "I had to take a few nights at a hotel in my own city due to an Emergency and was very surprised at how great this hotel is. \\nPros: The service is really above and beyond. Ask for anything and they will provide. The rooms are bigger than expected though the decor is unusual. No carpeted floors in the rooms which I love. Detachable shower heads were a plus. Two single seater couches in front of the TV for a King bed room in a hotel in downtown Toronto for about 300 a night? Wow.\\nCons: Very noisy. No soundproofing and other guests were loud on my floor. And the construction noise really vibrates throughout the room and you FEEL it. The AC is on the louder side so be ware though I didn't mind since I'm used to a loud AC. I didn't sleep the first night due to the noise outside the window. But oh well. I still gave it a 5 star because of how great the staff was. Really made me feel better at a time when I wasn't feeling great.\\",
            "Nice boutique property in Toronto. Overall nice rooms and great location.  Weird that in house restaurant is not part of hotel so therefore no Hyatt Globalist benefit of free breakfast and 500 in lieu of free breakfast never deposited into my account. Had a little excitement when I was there and homeless encampment next door caught on fire. 15 minutes all fires were extinguished and next morning all debris was efficiently removed.\\n\\nMain issue for me is the lack of pillow choice. Should have choice besides high thick foam pillows!!! Was tough to sleep on",
            "Looked forward to a nice, upscale hotel,, based on reviews. What we got was a Comfort Inn with a face-lift, without fixing the underlying issues. We stayed in room 205 which when you tried to run the heating didn't work well and was incredibly oisy, or would turn on the A\\u002FC.  They haven't changed the windows just put plantation shutters up to block the drafts.  The toilet role holder is mounted in such a way that you have to be a contortionist to reach it.  Bedding is a quilt with a microfiber quilt cover, and a microfiber blanket...only a bottom sheet, so if you sleep warm good luck, and a very firm mattress.  Good proximity to Yonge which is a blessing, as the hotel has no parking, though a public lot across the street.  So a basic hotel but because it's been given a face-lift they are asking luxury prices, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.",
            "People should know this hotel seems to attract more LGBT guests. On one side of the hotel drug addicts are shooting in needles while the other side is a homeless shelter. I was put in a wheelchair accessible room and could not switch rooms because they were \\u201Cfully booked\\u201D. I cut my stay short and checked into another hotel. It doesn\\u2019t appear to be a very safe area, I was not comfortable",
            "We stayed at this beautiful boutique hotel on the recommendation of friends. The hotel itself did not disappoint. Great staff. The bar is lovely (good food and super service) and the restaurant looked great too. The room itself was very retro cool with a record player and records available and a retro-looking phone. Shower was amazing! King size bed was very comfortable and had great pillows. But, we didn't sleep ... our room was directly above a homeless encampment. There was a lot of yelling\\u002Fpartying and too much fierce, extremely loud swearing that lasted until well past 2 am. Not great when you have to get up at 6. We will try it again sometime but request a room on the west side so as not to have to deal with that noise",
            "Tucked away a block from Yonge\\u002FBloor is a boutique hotel that has surprises at every turn. The online photos are very reflective of what you get, both from the rooms and the rest of the hotel. Very impressed by internal security and safe vibe. The bed was super-comfy and the shampoo\\u002Fconditioner\\u002Fbody wash smelled great. Oh, and as a bonus, you could turn the bathroom light on from your bedside, and turn on\\u002Foff all the individual lights in the room from your bedside",
            "Location is king when searching for a hotel, but the quality of the rooms will make or break your decision to book. The room had a great design and was comfortable. The hotel smelled amazing! The Anndore House was perfectly tucked away for a sound night of sleep, but centrally located that allowed easy movement across the city",
            "The hotel presents itself as a hipster joint, and has a nice vibe with friendly staff (at first) and an outdoor restaurant.  The rooms were fine, if a bit worn out, and the daily breakfast for globalists in the coffee shop worked well.  We liked the location, close to transit, attractions, and lots of interesting restaurants.  Unfortunately the last night we were there a very loud dinner party occupied the restaurant space on the first floor between our two rooms.  We had connecting doors with no sound insulation so when I say loud I mean not just that I could hear it but that I had to turn up the TV all the way in our room not to hear it.  When it started at six I asked the front desk about it and they said it would be over at 9.  Which was fine because we went out for dinner.  When it was still going on our return I was told that \\\"quiet time\\\" doesn't start until 11 so I'm out of luck until then.  But were not talking about some intermittent noise, were talking about a large group of people continually yelling to talk over each other.  A few wandered the halls, clearly drunk.  Around 10 I called again they claimed the party was about to end.  I said it really didn't sound like it was ending anytime soon so they offered to move us and discount our last night 50%.  I accepted, and they moved us from our suite to one of their regular rooms.  Here a few days later I find they have refused to discount the last night, saying the offer was to move of or discount the stay.  This I would not have accepted, and I don't like being lied to.  I cannot recommend this hotel, because they clearly value their restaurant business above guest experience and don't stand by their commitments or respect their guests. BTW I went down to check at 11:30 and the yelling and drinking was still going strong.\\n\\nThe neighborhood is great, though, I suggest staying somewhere nearby",
            "I travel to this city quite often and have been in search of a hotel with a convenient location.  On my recent visit I did just that when I happened upon this stylish and trendy looking boutique hotel.  The hotel was within walking distance to everything I needed and everyone I was there to visit.  Very close to subways, restaurants, parking, Yorkville shopping and groceries\\u002Fcafes.  The rooms are very spacious and offer some unique touches not normally found at other hotels.  It is nestled within a neighborhood off the main streets so you feel like you are in a home away from home.  From the walkup to the entry, the Anndore house is very esthetically pleasing. The staff are very attentive and friendly. This just may be my new \\\"go to\\\" for my frequent visits to this city in the future. I am looking forward to experiencing the hotels amenities (restaurants etc.) once the COVID restrictions are lifted.\\"

            "We rode the train in from Sarnia, and we were very pleased with the ease of locating the Hotel Victoria from the train station. We were also happy to find that the subway was just down the road and many great restaurants and things to see were nearby. \\nWe stayed towards the back of the 8th floor, and were pleased with how quite the hotel was. We heard very little hotel or street noise. The bed was incredibly comfortable, and although the room was small, it was plenty big enough for the two of us. We spent very little time in the room as we were out exploring so the small room didn't both us. \\nBeing that we were in the room so little, we had very little interaction with the staff. Though on the few occasions we did speak with those at the desk, they were pleasant and helpful.\\nThe only problem I had was with the mildew and mold in the shower. Being an old building, I can see that ventilation may be a problem. It appears to me that a little bit of bleach would go a long way. Aside from this one issue, we found the room to be very clean and well kept. The linens were pristine, the floors were immaculate, and the rest of the bathroom was well cared for.\\nIf we visit Toronto again, we would definitely stay at the Hotel Victoria for the price and location",
            "Disclaimer:  I am not being compensated in any way to write this review.  I'm just an occasional traveler.  The Hotel Victoria is in downtown Toronto, about a 12- to 15-minute walk away from the train station (Union Station). It's a boutique hotel with rooms that are on the small side, but nicely appointed.  Breakfast was not included with the room.  We stayed two nights in September 2019.\\n\\nThe hotel itself is nice enough, but the front desk could really use some training on interacting with the public.  We had originally booked a Deluxe King room. After checking in, we discovered that the room appeared to be on the other side of the wall from the elevator.  We went back down to the front desk and asked if we could be moved to another king room. The woman told us that all the king rooms were basically in the same location on the various floors.  She offered a queen room and she and my wife went back upstairs so my wife could check out the room.  On the way, the front desk woman stopped by the king room that we had originally booked and told my wife she had to check it to make sure we \\\"didn't take anything.\\\"  After this insult, we should have just canceled our reservation and found somewhere else.  We ended up staying two nights and then moved on to a nicer hotel (that was actually cheaper) in the same area downtown",
            "We booked a four night stay at Hotel Victoria in Toronto for a holiday vacation (December, 2013).  We were convinced by the internet pictures and descriptions of the hotel as a charming place to stay, and by the description in Fodor's 2012 guide to Toronto and Niagara Falls.  Our bottom line: the experience was so awful that we spent a good part of the first evening in the hotel finding another place to stay and checked out the following morning.  There were so many things to dislike: the room we stayed in was tiny and claustrophobic.  The bathroom was so small you essentially were in danger of tripping over the toilet upon entering the bathroom.  The heating system was absolutely terrible: the vent poured out heat at an extremely high temperature, and there was no way to modify it.  When we turned the heat off, we were freezing.  We spent the night with the heat on as low as possible and the window open, and got up continually throughout the night to adjust the heat and modify the degree to which the window was open.  There was no good solution to this problem:  we were alternately hot and sweating or freezing cold.  Fodor's indicated that a \\\"pro\\\" of the hotel was \\\"gym privileges at nearby health club.\\\"  This is absolutely misleading.  First, there was a hefty fee to use the \\\"nearby\\\" club; and in addition, it was several blocks from the hotel, which is not appealing when having to make a trip back after a work out.  Another problem was location: there was not much around at night, so options for meals were limited.  The only positive thing we can say about this hotel is that staff were gracious in allowing us to leave without penalty.  \\n\\nOne final comment: for people who still use print travel guides: my experience over years is that Frommer's is consistently reliable, Fodor's is not.  The only reason we used Fodor's guide is that we could not find a Frommer's that was as recent as Fodor's.  I will never pay for a Fodor's guide again",
            "I thought it would be worth it to stay really close to the main attractions in Toronto, but next time I'll pay the cab fare and stay somewhere else.  The room hardly had any standing space after I put my two pieces of luggage down.  The washroom had no amenities, neither did the room (there was no space for amenities anyway).  There was absolutely NO VIEW, and the staff basically ignored us since we were young.\\",

It was clean and the hotel staff was helpfull and gave us loads of directions and shortcuts around town.  The location if fabulous, blocks from BCE place, The waterfront, Eaton Centre and the subway.  It's half a block from Marche that is an open market concept restaurant that is delicious and will satisfy everyone.\\n\\nWe are going back in June.\\",

There is a fantastic restaurant across the street (Irish Emassy pub) and the hotel has a great breakfast restaurant attached...not cheap but excellent food.  Our room was very small but nice and the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in.  Our friends had a king room so they had a bench and a couple of chairs so thats where we visited.  The staff were lovely.  We felt the value was great and will stay here again.  Parking is expensive and awkward but that's Toronto.  All in all we were very happy with our choice",

Thank you Hotel Victoria for a great experience",
            "Weekend trip for a show at the Royal Alexandra Theater. We love this location, tons of restaurants within walking distance. Eaton Centre area about 10 min walk. Walk to theater also 10 min. Easy check in with a delightful staff member. Rooms and bathrooms are tiny as with all hotels of this type, but when you're not there much who cares? We were also three adults so could manage sharing one small bathroom (full length mirror outside the bathroom helped). Mini fridge was an unexpected perk; due to small hotel, no ice on every level, have to go to basement - easy or someone from front desk will bring to you. We blew a fuse with hairdryer; a maintenance person came up within five minutes and problem solved. Sadly we forgot a pair of shoes in the closet; happily, hotel kindly accommodated and sent the shoes to us for $25. Love that service! There is no parking specifically at this hotel but there is a structure just around the block on Wellington St (Indigo Pkg Garage), for $30 (American) per night, AND lots of spaces for charging electric vehicles, a pleasant surprise. Would highly recommend this lovely place",
            "A couple of years ago, I stayed here for the first time for one or two nights. It was by far the best-value mid-range accomodation I've stayed in in Toronto, because it's downtown, close to the train station and comfortable. I've travelled the world and have stayed in a wide range of accomodations, and the room where I stayed in the Hotel Victoria stands out in my memory for its cushy bed and nice bathroom.  Other places I've stayed in the city were overpriced and far-flung, or merely far-flung and cheap but not worth it. \\n\\nSince I'll be travelling by rail between Montreal and Windsor, I've decided to give the Hotel Victoria another go.\\",
            "My first experience with this hotel was when my boyfriend and I arrived in Toronto and missed the turn for the parking lot. We got very lost because of all the one-ways and could not figure out how to get back. I called the hotel for help and the woman was quite rude. Saying things like \\\"That's what I just said\\\" and \\\"That's what I'm trying to telling you\\\", etc (I took down her name but I accidentally deleted it). When we finally got parked (which was a NIGHTMARE) and got to the hotel, we checked in. We stayed for four days, three nights, and the staff never once said hello to us as we were coming in or going out. That is not \\\"superior customer service\\\" (as is said on their website). The room that we had, which was a standard queen was very small, however since it is a boutique hotel it was what I was expecting. The room was fine but there were markings all over the walls in the bedroom and bathroom. There were pieces of wood missing from the walls and the wallpaper was peeling. There were also black stains on the sheets and a mark on the head board. On the website it says that the bathrooms and guestrooms are newly renovated but if that is true then either they don't take good care\\u002F clean properly or they just didn't do a good job. The sink was old and cracking and there were tiles missing in the shower (the website makes it sound like the bathrooms are large but the shower was TINY, I could barely fit in it. When I dropped my razor it was almost impossible for me to pick it up. I feel that I must add that I am 5' 7\\\" and 120 pounds so I am not a big person.) Also the toilet was wobbly. The website says that the hotel (guestrooms and bathrooms) are newly renovated but it appears that only the lobby was. On the Saturday that we were there it was raining and so we asked the man at the front desk if he had an umbrella that we could borrow. He looked at us suspiciously and asked us what our room number was. When we told him, he gave us an umbrella and said \\\"make sure you bring that back\\\". When we went outside and opened the umbrella it was broken and wouldn't stay up. With all that being said, the hotel was in a great part of town and we enjoyed being close to many things",
            "I was a bit apprehensive at first, after reading some of the reviews; however, I was pleasantly surprised once I arrived at the hotel. We arrived early in the morning, although check in is only at 3, the staff made arrangements for our room to be ready for us to be able to rest. During our wait they offered a complimentary continental breakfast, took our baggages, so we could eat, sit and relax while we waited. Within a half hour our room was ready. Now that's service !!\\n\\nThe rooms were very nicely decorated, very clean, a bit on the small side but I really didn't mind, you have plenty of room to move around. The bed was comfortable, the rooms were quiet, we had two great nights of rest.\\n\\nThe complimentary continental breakfast had a good variety, cereal, muffins, toasts, croissants, cookies, fruits... everything fresh and delicious.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly, greated us everytime we came by the lobby. They were helpfull answering all our questions about the city and what to visit.\\n\\nWe will definitely be staying at the Hotel Victoria again on our next visit to Toronto.\\",
            "This boutique hotel was very nice. Everything was super clean. The room was a little small but fine for us since we were only staying one night. We were able to check in a little early which was nice. There is no parking but they directed us to a municipal lot a couple blocks away. We parked there overnight and paid about $38CAD when we left the next day, which from my understanding is pretty decent for downtown Toronto. It was nice to be right in the city and be in walking distance to a lot of things. Overall a great value, I would definitely stay here again.",
            "Having stayed in a dozen Toronto hotels on business over the years, this one was certainly the worst. I was charged $500 for an extremely modest room - tiny, outdated and uncomfortable bed, glitchy TV and a small window overlooking a brick wall. The room was inadequate, but the real problem is the price point - I was charged $500 which is obscene. When I asked if there may have been a price error, I was told that it included free water (!) and bath gowns.\\nThe hotel advertises itself as a \\\"boutique hotel\\\" which is very misleading - it has none of the charm, services, amenities or quality one would associate with that category. The hotel has no lobby or restaurant",
            "Unobtrusively tucked away on Yonge Street,  the historic Victoria is what I would consider to be a little gem.  We spent only one night here while in town for a concert, but we would definitely come back again! Our party occupied two Deluxe Twin rooms - one on the seventh floor, and one on the 2nd floor. The one on the 7th floor was definitely the better of the two (much larger, and with a better view), but both rooms were clean (the bathrooms scrupulously so), and the atmosphere was an oasis of quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a big city. In the case of the Victoria, \\\"old\\\" does not mean run-down -- indeed, it was much better maintained than many slick new establishments. While lacking in some of the amenities ~ such as a heated pool, a workout center, an in-house restaurant, and room service ~ that some people might consider necessities, we found the Victoria to be charming.  The Victoria is an excellent choice at a very attractive price point. It was within reasonable walking distance from parking and many downtown attractions. The continental breakfast was light, but ample; the staff congenial and helpful",
            "Foi a segunda vez que ficamos no hotel. Est\\u00E1 melhor ainda. O quarto parecia ter sido renovado. Bom atendimento. Muito bem localizado. Ao lado de esta\\u00E7\\u00E3o de metro King, do restaurante March\\u00E8, pr\\u00F3ximo da Union Station, a uma dist\\u00E2ncia caminh\\u00E1vel de lojas e do shopping center Toronto Eaton Centre. Voltamos a p\\u00E9 do Distillery District, passando pelo St Lawrence Market. Pr\\u00F3ximo da esta\\u00E7\\u00E3o de ferry para as Toronto Islands, que valem a pena serem visitadas num dia de sol. Ent\\u00E3o \\u00E9 muito pr\\u00F3ximo dos principais pontos tur\\u00EDsticos da cidade e permite fazer tudo a p\\u00E9, pra quem gosta de caminhar e ver a cidade, ou de transporte. Pra quem estiver chegando\\u002Fsaindo com malas, h\\u00E1 um caminho subterr\\u00E2neo mais pr\\u00E1tico com rampas, escadas rolantes e elevadores, desde a Union Station at\\u00E9 pr\\u00F3ximo do hotel: dentro da Union Station procure as placas para o Subway, des\\u00E7a (n\\u00E3o precisa comprar o ticket), ao chegar perto das catracas do metro, procure a placa indicando o caminho para Brookfield Place, vai sair dentro de um centro comercial com v\\u00E1rios restaurantes e fast food, suba a escada rolante e vai sair quase em frente ao Hockey Hall of Fame e ao March\\u00E8. Saindo pela porta para Yonge Street, siga na rua mais uns 50 metros e chegar\\u00E1 ao hotel. \\u00C9 bem mais f\\u00E1cil do que puxar as malas pelas cal\\u00E7adas",
            "The location in Old Toronto is great. Within walking distance to the water.\\nThe hotel itself appeared nice online but was very different on arrival. \\nNo shuttle to or from the airport. The shower in the room had a large gap in the wall that was unfinished with tile or grout. Seemed like a good place to grow mold. \\nRequested a different room and was moved to another floor with a room that had a broken air conditioner.  Moved again to a 3rd room. The rooms were very small. The room had no full length mirror. The towel rack fell off of the wall when I picked up the towel. There is only 1 ice machine in the entire building and it is in the basement of the hotel.\\nThe staff was very friendly and tried to be accommodating, but this place is kind of a wreck.  \\nI will be back to Toronto, but will find better options in the future",
            "We spent two nights at the Hotel Victoria aug 5-6. We had a queen room and like previous posters have said the room was very small. The location was great as the Wife being a shop-Alcoholic had a short walk to the Eaton Center and I being a avid baseball fan had less than a fifeteen minute walk to the Rogers Center. Lots of great dining choices near by and the noise from Yonge Street wasn't a problem, just the odd siren like any other downtown hotel. As there is no onsite parking We parked about 8 minutes away on the esplanade at a manned parking lot at the end of church street. $30.00 for two and a half days which wasn't too outrageous. Would We return to the Victoria? Likely if the price was right but We like to try different places so not likely anytime soon.\\",
            "H\\u00F4tel bien situ\\u00E9 pour visiter Toronto car il est pas tr\\u00E8s loin de la CN Towers. Petite astuce si vous voulez \\u00E0 CN Towers passer par la gare vous irez plus vite. Par contre les chambres son pas faite pour y rester toutes la journ\\u00E9e car trop petite avec une petite salle de douche. Sur les deux chambre r\\u00E9server 1 \\u00E9tait pr\\u00EAte tant dit que la deuxi\\u00E8me \\u00E9tais en cour de nettoyage",
            "We read good reviews on this website and thought the location was convenient since it's a few blocks from the train station. Upon seeing the front of the building, we were worried. It  looked run down, and upon entering the lobby looked even worse. Pipes with insulation hanging off them came out of the ceiling, and everything needed a coat of paint. We got the key to our room and went up in the elevator. The room wasn't completely uninhabitable, but for $130 a night I was expecting something better than a flophouse. \\n\\nMost of the furnishings looked ancient, the rug was obviously old and not clean, and the room was an odd shape and also very dark. The only window looked into a brick air shaft. \\n\\nWe went to the desk to complain, and they explained that there weren't that many other rooms in our price range. We got the keys to a more recently renovated room on the 2nd floor, but it wasn't much better. The light-colored rug was almost black in front of the door and the room was tiny. The window was about 5 feet about the floor with a through-the-wall air conditioner below it. \\n\\nWe checked out and found a room at the Day's Inn Hotel next to the old Maple Leaf Gardens. It was quite a bit cheaper and MUCH nicer. It even had a view. Don't stay at the Hotel Victoria, you will regret it. There are much better bargains around Toronto if you look",
            "Great location, close to everything in Toronto, a short walk from Union station. A quiet boutique hotel with very patient and helpfull staff, great for us as we just got off a transatlantic flight. Clean all over with everything you need. Good breakfast with a good selection of food to chose from. \\nA bit small rooms, but still we wanted for nothing",
            "Stayed a few nights and it\\u2019s location is great absolutely amazing! Walked to scotiabank arena for ice hockey game, CN Tower, Ripleys Underwater World, St Lawrence Markets etc. Great cafe just down to he street. Room compact but big enough! Very clean! And for you Pokemon or Wizards Unite fans my avatar flitted between 3 Pokestops and a couple of inns",
            "Hotel Victoria has a great location near many of Toronto's attractions, if you are looking for the fast pace of downtown Toronto. Our family booked two rooms and both were very clean and beautifully decorated. A continental breakfast is included, and the croissants were delicious! The hotel staff is very friendly. The only drawback is that the hotel does not have parking facilities. The closest public parking lot is about 3 blocks away and it will add up if your stay is longer than a night. Overall, staying at Victoria Hotel was very pleasant",
            "Arrived tired after a long flight from England to find that our room had been cancelled and sold to some one else. They had informed me, I later found, by e-mail whilst I was on the plane. We were then given a small room with a double bed that I had to share with my sister before moving to our booked room the next day. We subsequently found out that there were 2 conferences on in Toronto that day so all hotels were full. The staff did not care, were not apologetic, never smiled the whole time we were there. We were offered a free buffet breakfast as compensation - wow!!!\\nApart from that the beds are very comfortable and the hotel is in a good location in Downtown Toronto. Would not bother to eat in 'Over Easy', the Marche just a minute down the street is much better, cheaper and has a huge choice.\\nThe staff in this hotel need to definitely go on a customer service course as they have a 'do not care, not my problem attitude' - not a good advert for visitors to Toronto",
            "Will definitely come back and stay again! Located in Toronto's city center, subway station is in 2 mins away. Although this is a over 100 years historical hotel, but you can merely find it old. The water pressure is great, no pipe noise and with decent room rate. Recommend to young travelers who want to explore this charming city in a convenient way",
            "I discovered this hotel through Tripadvisor. I was looking for a place that was reasonably priced, given the fact that it was downtown, and a place that was conveniently located. Thankfully, this hotel delivered both and we stayed 3 nights. This place is excellent!!! Note: my review is for their DELUXE room.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\n1) Rooms are clean, new, and modern. Incidentally, I'm pretty sure the paint in some of the hallways was only a few days old. Our deluxe room came equipped with all the standard stuff but it also had a mini-fridge and, surprisingly, free all-you-can-watch Apple TV. While I didn't watch a lot of it, I did watch some and it was great. The place has a boutique feel.\\n\\n2) Location is Yonge St. This place is a 5-minute walk to Union Station, the Hockey Hall of fame is about a block down, there's a 24-hour grocery store that's accessible with a short walk, it's about 10 minutes walk to the Harbourfront, etc. The short of it: location is top-notch; you can walk everywhere. There's a Subway literally next door, along with a restaurant in the hotel, and Starbucks and Shoppers Drugmart are a block away.\\n\\n3) Staff. They were professional, helpful. Any problems we had were quickly taken care of. Even the cleaning staff were keen to help out when we had issues with our TV.\\n\\n4) Free Wi-Fi. Needless to say, many of the so-called top-tier hotels still charge for this in 2012. Hotel Victoria's was consistent and quick and hassle-free.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\n1) While the rooms were new and clean, the hotel clearly had some issues with its building contractors. The room flooring must have been installed hastily because it creaked pretty much everywhere you walked on it. While the bathroom was also clean and new, the tub was already pulling away from some of the sealant between it and the tiles. These were just minor, incidental things, but they were noticeable.\\n\\n2) The curtains didn't fully darken our room. The light from outside kept the room brighter than it should have been at night",
            "The staff here were all attentive and sincere in their services. I loved the sense of history and the blend of old and new in the interiors. The room of course was smaller than new hotels but very functional. I mentioned to staff the lighting could be a bit brighter. The location in Old Toronto is excellent being a few steps from King Subway station",
            "This is a budget friendly hotel near to all major attractions in Toronto. You can even walk to all point of interest from this place. Price is basically affordable. Rooms are small but cute. If you\\u2019re not choosy about size this works for people on budget. They have a small lobby and a famous restaurant where they served good food at a low price. Staffs are very good and friendly. They are not too strict on check out time, and you are allowed to leave your luggage with them",
            "We stayed in the renovated rooms (asked for them specifically on booking) and they were fabulous.  Our rooms were richly appointed with excellent quality linens and other furnishings.  Apple TV was available, as well as wireless internet service (free).  The lobby is gorgeous, and the staff friendly and helpful.  We noted that housekeeping was meticulous and everything, from rooms to common areas were clean and tidy.  You cannot beat the location of this hotel on Younge Street.  You are within walking distance to CN Tower, many fine restaurants, and trolleys that will take you to many great points of interest.  The downstairs restaurant is also pretty good - food is great (especially for breakfast), and prices are reasonable, although service was so-so.  Value for money is spot-on here, and we would definitely recommend.  We shall return",
            "We stayed Jun13-15 in the Queen deluxe on the 7th flr. The room was exactly the same as in the picture. The beds were comfy and rooms were very clean. Recommend keeping the fan on to cover street noise. The window blinds do not cover the windows and makes for a very bright 7am. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The restaurant on site was more expensive than Sunset Grill which was only a few blocks north. This hotel is in central downtown within walking distance of shopping, the Rogers Centre and the harbour.  We would definitely recommend this hotel to couples who need a comfortable room to sleep after enjoying the sites of beautiful downtown Toronto. We look forward to our return visit",
            "I usually book my hotel reservations on line. I choose the location then read some of the reviews and look at the pictures of the rooms and facilities. This is one of those few times that when I entered the room, it looked exactly like the picture on line.Of course I was very pleased. I loved that they had wooden floors and had those sofas at the foot of the bed. The room was clean and fresh. i reserved for a queen room with two queen beds like I usually do but the space in this room was much larger than the past ones I have been to.\\nNo restaurant in the hotel, but I did not mind because it was at the center of downtown Toronto and we planned to dine out. I would highly recommend this place. Slept like a baby and very satisfied customer",
            "We recently stayed at this hotel for one night as we were attending a hockey game at the Air Canada Centre. It is located within walking distance and is very close to restaurants, pubs, etc.\\nThe added bonus is if you are attending an event, you can show your ticket on check-in and you will receive a discount on your room.\\nThe hotel room was clean and very comfortable",
            "My fiance & I just got back from a wonderful weekend in Toronto.  We picked Hotel Victoria because it was less than 5 minutes walking distance to the ACC and other attractions that we wanted to go to.  Also, Expedia had a 'web special' rate on the hotel for $105 + tax.  The Hotel itself and our room, were very clean, and the frontdesk staff were helpful and offered us an early check-in.  Parking for the hotel was not included, but very close by in Commerce Court on Wellington St.  For approx  28 hours, our parking fee was $24.00, which was reasonable.  We also ate at \\\"Over Easy\\\" the adjoining all-day breakfast restaurant.  The restaurant was very clean and bright, and the food was fresh and homemade.\\nIf you're looking for good value (by Toronto standards) on a night's stay with lots of nearby amenities, and nothing luxurious, this is an excellent pick",
            "I was here for one night on business.  I did a lot of calling around as I am familiar with Toronto and its hotels, this was by far the best value for a limited budget.\\n\\nRoom was clean, bed was big and comfortable, desk was a little too small, view was non-existent but that was fine by me.  Location is great, right downtown, although parking is a pain; I parked at Nathan Phillips Square because all the local parking lots go astronomical for weekdays, so I parked from 3:00 Sunday to 3:00 Monday afternoon for less than $20.00, although I was a ten minute walk from the hotel.\\n\\nWish I'd known about the free internet as I would have taken my laptop; I ended up on a late night run up Yonge St. to an internet cafe to obtain some information I could have gotten for free in my room.\\n\\nPrice is the best thing; it's pretty high season in Toronto, but it was only $135 for a queen room for a night; lowest alternative was $179.  This place is better located than the HoJo on Avenue Road and Bloor, although the latter is a bit cheaper.  I'd place them in the same ballpark quality wise.\\n\\nPeople complain about no restaurant and bar.  I don't get it - Toronto has hundreds or thousands of great restaurants and bars, who would eat at the hotel?  Great Irish bar right across the road where I capped the night with a couple of pints.  Lots of restaurants within short distances",
            "Clean facility, Courteous Staff, the bed was overly comfortable! Just a fabulous base to work from for Hockey Hall of Fame, Rogers Centre, CN Tower, Eaton Centre walking distance to ALL! I will Happily Return",
            "Advertised as a boutique hotel, Victoria Hotel delivers on its promises. First, the location is terrific.  Just about 3 blocks from the train station, 1 block from subway and streetcar, near many restaurants, it makes a great base for anyone spending any amount of time in Toronto.\\n\\nOur room was small,  but that was expected. Because it is a heritage building jammed between two new buildings, most of the rooms do not have windows (\\\"fake windows\\\" with a bit of light). If you need a \\\"real\\\" window, you'll need to book a room in the front overlooking Younge Street (probably more expensive).  The room had everything we needed, although the A\\u002FC unit was quite noisy.\\n\\nStaff was friendly and helpful.  All amenities in the rooms. Note that there was no porter to help with the luggage ... not an issue for us.\\n\\nGREAT choice for downtown .... the amenities without breaking the bank",
            "To be honest with you, I was little bit worried before staying at the hotel after the reviews we had read on the site. This was our final stop on our 4wk trip around Canada where we had stayed in delightful b and bs and small inns. I even went as far as checking the web for any last minute deals at another hotel.\\nWe were very surprised by the accomodating and friendly staff at the front desk who provided maps and organised our tour to Niagara. When we checked in, they even notified us that the rate quoted in our email had been reduced because of specials they were offering. We were surprised that our room was modern, clean and comfortable. There was plenty of room (we stayed in a deluxe room with queen bed).\\nFor breakfast, they served warm muffins, croissants, bread, and cereal. Not bad for a meal that is included in the rate. The breakfast room was a bit dark, and small. The lobby, and lift could do with a bit of a face lift, but the most important was our room.\\nThe hotel is a few minutes walk to Eaton Centre, Air Canada Centre, and CN Tower. The subway is only a few steps away. Excellent location.\\",
            "I've stayed at many hotels in Toronto on business trips that I pay for myself. So I was happy to have everything I needed, no creepy carpet or bedspreads in this spare room with free wi-fi. This is a no frills hotel. This hotel does not provide room service meals or in house restaurant, It is close to good restaurants though. My room had no view but it did have a window so I could let in air and light. You can pay extra if you want pay per view movies, otherwise, you get basic cable which is fine for daily news. It is close to the subway and major streetcars, right downtown so many destinations are walkable.\\nThere is a breakfast restaurant with standard breakfast fare and bad coffee. Convenient if you're not fussy.\\nMy room did have an annoying design flaw in the tiny bathroom, allowing the shower to leak all over the floor, needing many towels to mop up after.\\nStaff was friendly",
            "I was more than pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I arrived late and was welcomed quickly and warmly by the desk staff. It took minutes to check me in, and I was in my room. The hotel must have been renovated because for such an old historic hotel, it was very modern and comfortable. I could hear some street noise outside, but I couldn't hear a peep from surrounding rooms in any direction.\\n\\nThe bed was very VERY comfortable - I slept like a baby in it. Highly recommend it for the beds alone!\\n\\nAnd I have to comment on the cleanliness... because I was trying to squeeze lotion out of their provided little bottle in the bathroom when the bottle exploded on me... But what impressed me as I wiped up the lotion from the hardwood floor was those tissues did not have a speck of dust or dirt on them - this was one super clean room! Can't be sure it would pass one of those tests they do on the shock shows, but I can't think of many places in a Toronto winter with floors that clean!\\n\\nThe hotel is located on the Eastern edge of the \\\"PATH\\\", Toronto's underground city. You still had to step outside to access the PATH, but it was literally next door so not too bad given how extremely cold it was when I was there. The hotel is close to Union Station and the business district (all accessible by the PATH - but ask for a map otherwise you'll get lost!). \\n\\nIt wasn't very close to any stops made by the airport express bus - the nearest stops were about 10 minutes walk away (I imagine the Union Station bus stop was once upon a time close - until they began whatever is causing the monster construction there that has shut down the streets in that area for a few years now and the bus has to detour to quite a ways away...",
            "The location of this hotel in downtown Toronto can't be beat.  There are stores and restaurants and museums all around, and of course, the Lake isn't far.  We were pleasantly surprised by how quiet our rooms were.  (We stayed in two different rooms on two separate stays.)  We didn't hear noise from adjacent rooms or the street.  And the hotel is right on the Yonge street subway line.  The rooms were perfectly clean.  Many reviews of this hotel mention poor lighting in the rooms.  The hotel must have added lamps recently because, with the lamps and the overhead light turned on, the lighting was certainly adequate.  The front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful.  But there were some drawbacks.  The rooms are very small, and they don't include a chair.  Neither of our rooms had a real chair, although the second one had a low leather stool.  Not comfortable for sitting on.  There's no fridge or microwave in the rooms.  Also, there was no closet in either room.  There was a metal rod about 12 inches long in a corner, with a few hangers on it.  If you travel with a lot of clothes that you like to hang up, this hotel is not for you.  The view out the window in both rooms was of a brick wall.  Don't go to this hotel expecting views of downtown Toronto or the Lake.  The elevator is very slow.  And there was no restaurant or snack shop in the hotel, so we had to go out every morning for breakfast.  But there are plenty of places for breakfast within a few blocks.  All in all, the drawbacks are minor if you're going to Toronto to see the sights.  Just be prepared for the limitations.",
            "My boyfriend & I stayed for two nights to attend the Muse concert at the Air Canada Center. It was a last minute reservation and I hadn't been in Toronto for years, so I went quickly through some reviews online to find a good spot downtown. The hotel is at very short walking distance of the subway, Union train & bus station, many restaurants and cafes, Eaton Station (10 min), CN tower... But most of all, it offers you this quick access to all the attractions without the boredom of a chain hotel. The lobby itself is quite beautiful, and the room we booked was cool-looking and very clean. We both agreed it was the most confortable bed we ever slept in! The only downside for me was the Wi-Fi connection: while it was free, it was very (very!) slow, and we were located on the third floor. Also, Yonge St. does get noisy even late a night, but nothing earplugs can't deal with. \\n\\nI would definitely stay there again",
            "The Hotel Victoria is perfectly located on Yonge Street, one half block from a subway station, ten minutes walk from Union Station, and within walking distance of the best Toronto has to offer.  If you are looking for more than location, however, you will be disappointed.  The clean, comfortable rooms are small, (approx. fifteen feet square with ten foot ceilings) with an adequate bathroom.  There is only one small elevator.  We paid approximately $375 for three nights, with an additional $47 to park our car in a nearby garage.  If you are into pools and spas and pampering or are traveling with children, this is definitely not what you're looking for.  If, however, your goal is to blend into the city and explore, you'll be very pleased.\\",
            "We just returned from Toronto and stayed at the Hotel Victoria on Yonge Street from June 11th-June 15th. I was hesitant at first because of the other reviews posted but from past experience I decided to go with my gut, and with what Frommers had recommended. \\n\\nI made the reservation online and received a prompt response. About a week before we left I emailed them and asked to ensure we received a non-smoking room. I just didn't want to take any chances and all was perfect upon arrival. We checked in about one hour ahead of schedule which was nice b\\u002Fc we wanted to get out and about asap. The staff behind the reception desk seemed to change often which we found amusing. They were all pleasant, not overly, but pleasant and easy to deal with. \\n\\nAs indicated in other reviews, the room was small but clean, and this was more important to me. Clean is a must. The bathroom was quaint and our view was, well, a brick wall but we spent very little time in the hotel room so we weren't worried. The temperature rose as the week went on and the air conditioning worked well. Each day we returned to find our room spotless. The one drawback was the lack of a munchie machine in the hotel. This sounds silly I know but when Game 5 of the Stanley Cup is on you need your munchies. There was a pop machine and ice machine in the basement though. \\n\\nNext door to the hotel was a little newstand\\u002Fconvenience store. We only noticed it on day 3 or so and wish we had found it earlier. It was called International News. The woman there was so nice and welcoming and very chatty. It was great. She asked where we were from and where we were going, etc. This was a great place to grab snacks to sneak into the Jays game. The only problem is it closed around 7pm, but that's ok. The woman there made up for it. \\n\\nThis hotel is all about location, location, location. It was about a 5 min walk from the Eatons Centre. Yonge Street is incredible, full of shopping and restaurants. I highly recommend Eggspectations just up the road and Shopsy's across the street. Yum. It was also practically right next door to the Hockey Hall of Fame. This made it easy to run around, come back and rest a minute, and then keep exploring. \\n\\nThe one thing I really liked about Hotel Victoria is that they were not all gushy over us. We would come and go, they would say hello, and that was about it. The night before we checked out I was stressing b\\u002Fc our flight was only at 8pm and the thought of dragging our luggage around terrified me. I asked the girl at the desk (I think her name was Carla?) if they would keep our luggage after check out for the day and she said it was no problem and it would be locked up until we returned. Fantastic. This was a big help and a huge relief. \\n\\nOne more thing...we never heard a sound from the other rooms or even in the hallways.\\n\\nIf you want a pool, a fabulous in house restaurant, and lots of room....do not go here but if you want good value in a great downtown location then this is the place for you. And I'm picky so trust me.\\",
            "Stayed here for a night while attending a concert nearby. Location itself is central & close to entertainment & restaurants. We were fortunate to have good weather and were able to walk everywhere. Reception staff were great. Our room itself was comfortable, clean & bigger than I expected for a boutique hotel. The decor is modern. My only complaint would be the noise from early morning street traffic below which I\\u2019m sure is typical for downtown Toronto. I would stay here again.",
            "My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Victoria.\\n\\nPros\\n1. Hotel is clean and well maintained.\\n2. Staff were polite enough - they could be warmer and friendlier but nonetheless acceptable and par for the course in a big city.\\n3. Compares favorably against other establishments of similar rating and room rates in both USA and Canada. \\n4. Room is well-decorated, spacious and extremely comfortable with clean and new linen and towels, cable TV, iron and ironing board, coffee maker and free WiFi internet (which works!)\\n5. Conveniently located to shopping, restaurants and, for those keen on walking, within walking distance of the business district and many tourist attractions including the Hockey Hall of Fame, the Waterfront, Air Canada Centre (Toronto Maple Leafs), Roundhouse Park, CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Wayne Gretzky's, Roy Thomson Hall, Canada's Walk of Fame, Eaton Centre, etc.\\n6. Hockey Hall of Fame is only a 2 minute walk away.\\n7. OverEasy, the onsite restaurant, serves fantastic food for breakfast and lunch, at reasonable prices.\\n8. Great Burger Kitchen is a 5 minute walk away at 9 Church St. Possibly the cheapest food within walking distance of the hotel, yet the burgers were fantastic! Especially important as most restaurants in the immediate area are costly.\\n\\nCons\\n1. No on-site car parking. Note that there is a City of Toronto (Green P) municipal parking facility nearby at 2 Church St. It is a covered and secured parking station for about $14 per day. While the carpark is nearby, it was slightly inclined uphill and very inconvenient with large luggage bags.\\n2. On-site restaurant, OverEasy, is not open for dinner (wish it was!)\\n\\nSummary\\nI have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, particularly at the discounted room rate I was lucky enough to secure, plus the convenience of location to the primary attractions we wanted to visit eg HHOF. Would we stay again? Yes definitely.\\n\\nI am giving the Hotel Victoria 4 Stars, not as any suggestion of hotel star-classification, but as a reflection of our satisfaction with the establishment. A thumbs up!\\n\\nA humungous thanks should you rate this review as helpful. Happy travels",
            "We flew into Toronto and took the public transport from the Airport to the Hotel - you end up on the subway and you can get off near enough to the hotel to wheel your bags no problem. Its simple and v cheap.  We left Toronto after 2 nights by train and walked to the station from the Hotel - we are fit and able and suitcases are on wheels but it was an easy flat walk.  The room was excellent, lovely big comfortable bed, fab sheets and all very clean. The room had a small fridge and coffee machine, old but ok a\\u002Fc, good bathroom and huge closet with iron and board.  There is a great restaurant a few doors down from the Hotel called Marche.  It serves every type of food and drink you could wish for at any time of the day. Its also opposite an Irish Bar.  I booked a king sized deluxe bedroom in advance, we got a room on the top floor with king sized bed and it looked like the top floor was finished!!!  Other floors look like works was still ongoing.  Being high up the city noise and buzz was not a problem but don't expect a view.  We walked everywhere in the city from the Hotel, it really is well situated - staff were friendly and helpful, they booked us a table for supper at CNN tower without a problem",
            "Great location poor hotel.\\nThe hotels location as great within walking distance of most if the tourist locations in Toronto.but the hotel look like it's been renovated on the cheap.

            "My main requirements for a hotel are nice decor and cleanliness, and the hotel delivered on both counts. I had a standard queen room for three nights on the seventh floor (room 707). I'm a bit paranoid about bed bugs, so I examined the sheets, mattress, duvet, pillows, etc. when I first arrived, and it was all perfectly spotless. In fact, the whole room was spotless, and it was cleaned nicely each day while I was out. I have (over)sleeping issues, so on the second night, I hung the \\\"do not disturb\\\" sign on my door and slept in till about 2:00pm. No one bothered me, and when I came back to the room at night, it had been cleaned. My compliments to the cleaning staff!\\n\\nThe location of the hotel couldn't be better: it's a couple blocks from Union Station, and right in the  middle of the Financial District\\u002FOld Toronto (so lots of gorgeous architecture nearby). There's an entrance to the subway about a block up Yonge Street, many fast food restaurants, coffee shops, and restaurants very close by, and the Eaton Centre is a short walk away. \\n\\nThe bed was extremely comfortable (as everyone seems to agree), the decor was tasteful, there was plenty of lighting, you could adjust the temperature in your room, and the window opened, so you could get some outside air. The shower head had excellent pressure. I liked that the floors were not carpeted - it's more modern and to me, seems cleaner. Only thing is - the hotel's website says the floors are hardwood, but I'm pretty sure they're laminate. In any case, they're nice. The tv was right across from the foot of the bed, and had cable. There was no bathtub, which wasn't a problem for me as I wouldn't have used it anyway - I only point this out because I notice the website says that standard queen rooms have \\\"spacious bathtubs,\\\" which my room didn't have.\\n\\nThe only thing I would change (and I imagine the hotel wants to change as well) is that there is a little space between the glass shower door and the little retaining wall that is supposed to keep the water within the shower unit, meaning there is usually some overspill of water onto the bathroom floor. It wasn't a big deal to me, as I just put a towel there to collect the overspill, but I think it's damaging the wall below the shower over time. \\n\\nIn response to the typical complaints of those who gave the hotel two stars or less, their complaints tend to centre around these areas, which I will respond to so readers can make informed decisions:\\n1) Parking. If you're driving to the hotel, this could be an issue for you if you're not prepared to walk a bit. I took the train, so there was no problem. I wouldn't want to drive in Toronto anyway.\\n2) Lack of bars\\u002Frestaurants\\u002Froom service\\u002Fetc. In my case, I never take advantage of those amenities anyway. I think it's much more interesting to get out of a hotel and explore the city, go to a different place for breakfast each morning, observe the locals, etc. If room service and a mini bar are important to you, keep in mind that this hotel doesn't have them. I believe it does have an onsite breakfast and lunch restaurant, but I didn't go to it, so I can't review it.\\n3) Views from your hotel room window. I'm sure some rooms have views, but my room had a view of the grey brick wall of the building next door. This didn't bother me at all, because I know what the city looks like, so I don't really need to see it while in my room. Also, it means I never had to shut the blinds. If you want more natural light while in your room, you might want to consider requesting a room that doesn't face a wall. There's quite enough lighting in the room otherwise.\\n4) The shower unit was not large, which was not a problem for me, as I'm not very big, but I imagine if you were a larger person width-wise, you might feel crowded. But I only had a standard room - perhaps bigger rooms have bigger bathrooms. \\n5) Noise from the street. I had a room facing a brick wall on the 7th floor. With the window shut, there was no noise at all. With the window open, you'd occasionally hear a honk from a car, people shouting, and so forth. However, I have a tip for travellers ANYWHERE - bring a pair of foam drugstore earplugs! Then street noise\\u002Fnoise on planes or trains won't bother you at all! \\n6) Unfriendliness of staff. I didn't find any evidence that the staff was unfriendly at all. I met what appeared to be a maintenance guy in the elevator, and he even asked me how I was enjoying my stay. I found the front desk people friendly enough. Probably it depends on what mood you catch people in. I never had any problems to address with them, so I wasn't in a bad mood myself.\\n\\nOverall, I would say that if you're a traveller who regards a hotel as mostly a place you retire to at night for sleep (and want to be clean, comfortable, and modern), then you'll love this hotel. If you regard the hotel itself as your holiday, you might want to look elsewhere (because there's no room service). \\n\\nAlso, I believe the hotel was quite recently renovated, so keep this in mind when reading older reviews, because their negatives are probably no longer applicable",
            "We had a great experience overall! Here's my summary:\\nPros: location right on Yonge St can't be beat! We were attending an NHL game and the walk was 10 minutes. Tons of pubs and restaurants all minutes away. Value; can't be beat for a hotel nestled in downtown Toronto. Decor is modern elegant meets old fashioned charm (it was built in 1909!). It was Clean! I cannot stress enough about how important that is to me! Staff were friendly for check-in\\u002Fcheck-out.\\nCons (not really cons but I'm trying to be objective here): very tiny room. We didn't much care though since we were literally just sleeping there and leaving the next day. The hotel does not have parking available. The place they recommend is 10 minutes away (but affordable). The building is very old so 'soundproofing' is non-existent. Not much can be done about that. \\nI would stay here again, hands down",
            "My sister and I were looking for a cheap, decent hotel in downtown Toronto that would be close to all of the major attractions and public transportation.  For the price (compared to other hotels downtown), I was expecting this hotel to be strictly budget.  It far exceeded my expectations.  It's recently remodeled and it shows.  For $144, we got a deluxe queen room with a mini fridge.  The room was extremely clean and very chic.  The view wasn't the greatest (the windows were dirty) but there wasn't much to see except the stores across the street.  It was very quiet and a great place to crash after hectic days of sightseeing (we stayed for three nights). \\n\\nYou won't get an incredible view like some of the hotels downtown, parking is a pain (I suggest relying on public transportation if you stay here), and there is no pool or exercise room.  It was, however, an extremely good deal for the price, clean, cute, and up-to-date.  The location cannot be beat (you can walk to the lake, the CN tower is a quick streetcar ride away, and the King subway station is a short walk up the street).  I honestly cannot imagine staying anywhere else if I ever visited Toronto agai"

Ray helped me get checked in despite my early arrival and even got me a deluxe suite for a small additional fee (very small and so worth it).

There was plenty of room for the hairdresser,  makeup artist and photographer to do their magic.   The venue was a short stroll from the Hyatt and the day and bride were beautiful.

            "I had such a terrible experience here. First, was told I would be able to get CN view, did not get that, was given a cold shoulder at the front desk when I was kindly telling them I'm not from here. Second, found stains all over pillows and comforters. The rooms are A LOT darker than expected with very small bathrooms. Asked for towels, never received them. Refused my boyfriend in the parking garage when he showed the hotel confirmation and the garage booth person told him its fake, told him he's not allowed to park here. My boyfriend offered the $15 flat fee which the man still refused, my boyfriend then offered $25 to let him park so he could quickly get the parking slip from the hotel front desk to show him and he still said no. He told my boyfriend to find parking elsewhere and get the parking pass from the hotel to show him he's actually staying there when I came 30 minutes before in my car with no problems and showed the hotel confirmation from my phone as well. Made it such a difficult experience for me for absolutely no reason and because of this, we had missed my birthday dinner reservations and struggled to find anything to eat because this whole process got us so delayed along with every restaurant being booked for the night. At the very end, I have now gotten 2 separate charges that I honestly don't even know why since I literally was just in the hotel to change or to sleep. Got an understanding that id have to pay for parking which is obviously a given, but again, unknown charges... This hotel honestly ruined my first experience in Toronto",

            "Recently my son and I took a personal vacation in the city of Toronto and decided to stay at the Hyatt as it was more central in walking distance to many of the sights we wished to see.  The initial greet by Fardin was welcoming and very helpful.  We had a basic 2 double bed room and even though it was just a basic room, it was clean and every day the staff made sure to come in and make the room.  We had the breakfast buffet every morning for our 5 day stay.  The staff in the restaurant were absolutely amazing.  From welcoming us personally by name, being friendly and giving exceptional service.  The chef on the first morning made our omelets to order, and the next day he remembered my son's order as well as a few days later when he had been off.  When we were chatting with them one morning, we had told them we were going to Niagara Falls and they offered to pack up a lunch or asked if we needed a snack for the ride.  I truly enjoyed our breakfast, James, Suzanne, Raj and Minh made the experience wonderful.  And the food was fabulous.  Our last evening there we had the pizza special and the nachos through room service.  Talk about the best tasting nachos I have ever had!  Lots of toppings and generous portions.  Same with the pizza, I thought it was going to be your everyday sort of pizza, but it was not.  It was made like a gourmet pizza.  I would definitely go back there to stay (although I might get a bigger room).",

I called the hotel the night before our stay at 10:30pm and someone picked up right away as I wanted to ensure a crib was in the room prior to our arrival for my daughter\\u2019s nap.  They were happy to accommodate.  The next day, in the morning I decided to arrange a flower delivery for my wife in the room and the front desk and concierge both worked with me to have the flowers in the room prior to our arrival.  This was awesome as my wife had no idea!  Great surprise.  Further, staff assisted with additional sheets, late check-outs to accommodate a nap schedule and more to make our one-night stay at the hotel special.  We enjoyed the rooftop pool, and proximitey to Torontos big attractions. The hotel was integral to my wife\\u2019s quick birthday get away",
            "We stayed here for the first time for Fan Expo as our usual hotel in the area was already sold out when we tried to make a reservation. Though it was more expensive than our usual choice, it was quite underwhelming in comparison, with older bathroom fixtures, less space in the room (the lack of counter space was especially inconvenient), and a dark and somewhat claustrophobic lobby. How they can justify the rates they charge is astounding, even for downtown Toronto, because as previously mentioned less expensive hotels in the area are significantly better. Here's hoping we can stay at our usual hotel again next year, as we have no interest in returning here. It wasn't a bad experience, but it wasn't even close to being worth the rate charged, especially after having stayed many times at a less expensive hotel nearby that we had liked much better",

His handling of our reservation was flawless, handing us information for local restaurants and a city map. Also enrolled us in the loyalty scheme.\\n\\nWas a bit of confusion as another guest had the same\\u002Fsimilar name to me (lucky for them, I'd say) and sorted very easily.\\n\\nThe room was clean and well maintained, noting to see out of the window as such. There was a bit of noise as construction was going on near the hotel, but is there a major city that doesn't?!?  The room was quiet at night, so it was all good there.\\n\\nDidn't book breakfast or eat in the hotel, so I couldn't comment on this.\\n\\nDid have a drink at the lobby bar, which feedback needs to be given.  We sat at the bar, and I was surprised by the amount of drain flies\\u002Fbeer flies as we call them in the UK.  Not pleasant at all and not expected in that kind of hotel, more something I'd expect from a run down back street pub in the UK.  To see them fly around where the service area and cocktail fruit (lemons\\u002Flimes) put me off having a second drink.  I'd suggest finding the source and fixing it.\\n\\nWould I recommend? - Yes, it's a great hotel and locations.\\n\\nWould I go again? - Yes, even considering the bar issue",
            "The first room we got had a leaky air conditioner and broken main door, so Allen at the front desk upgraded us to a room on a higher floor. The hotel itself definitely feels dated but clean, and noise isolation was relatively good. Location can't be beat as a tourist, with a 15 minute walk from CN Tower, Union Station, and Chinatown. While the rooms were standard, cleaning was always thorough. Overall, the service and location made the Hyatt worth staying at",
            "Very happy with our stay at the Hyatt. As it was my husband and I\\u2019s first time travelling to Toronto, we wanted a nice place to stay downtown so everything would be walking distance. The Hyatt was the perfect place for us, all the front desk staff and concierge were so helpful in answering our questions. House keeping also did a great job on freshening up our room daily and stocking everything we needed. The view from our room was to die for, it was beautiful day and night. The room could use some work on the carpets and toilet. Overall we had an amazing stay and we would definitely recommend the Hyatt",

As most Hyatts are, this hotel is clean and well maintained, and the staff is friendly and helpful. The breakfast buffet in the hotel restaurant, while a bit pricey, offers a wide variety of tasty food. The only hiccup we encountered was that we initially could not get the safe to work in our room, and it took two phone calls to the front desk to get someone upstairs to look at it. Otherwise, the room was comfortable and included complimentary bottled water which was replaced each day. The fitness room, while small, was also clean and well-maintained",

            "Not many Hyatt hotels at a major city center get AAA\\u002FCAA diamond ratings below four like this one, after celebrating the New Year's Eve here I understood why.\\nThe Good:\\nService is satisfactory, at least after you reminding them. There was no option to choose the view\\u002Fdirection when booking the room on Hyatt website, so I added a message to ask for a high floor room facing the CN Tower so I can watch fireworks on my bed. I did get one facing CN Tower at 12th floor (they have 20 stories though), but that was after I asking for it again when checking in - they assigned me another room before that. The view was not bad, perfect view of the CN Tower, some obstacles to view the fireworks though, 20th floor would probably be much better.\\nThe Not So Good:\\nAs a Hyatt hotel, room is small and needs renovation, even considering its location. I lived at the Sheraton at walking distance, and Westin by the lakeside, their rooms were bigger and newer.\\nParking is overcharged. They share the lot with public parking and charge $32 for self-parking (no valet), while public parking at exactly the same place is $24 for 24 hours on my night (Friday night and New Year's Eve, hard to imagine any other night would be more expensive, if not cheaper), so they literally overcharge guests at least 33% for nothing.\\nThe Bad:\\nSoundproofing is as terrible as, if not more terrible than, most motels. I'm all fine hearing people on the street yelling \\\"Happy New Year\\\" at 12am (my room's on 12th floor though), but hearing guests in other rooms talking and singing at 2am is not a very pleasant experience.\\nRoom cleanness is far below Hyatt standard. The space behind beds are visibly dirty, my kids are allergic to dust mite so we were concerned. All of us had itchy throat or coughing in the room, I even had runny nose by midnight, we almost suspected we caught COVID, but after taking Claritin we were all fine within a couple of hours. Btw I rarely have allergies, so the air conditioning system needs a deep clean too.\\nIn short, before they make a major renovation, you'd better spend the same budget at another major brand hotel in downtown Toronto",
            "The staff were friendly. No complimentary water available, nor decaffeinated tea in the room.  The pool not available. The location is good.

            "The hotel lobby and room was very nice. Great view of the CN tower and perfect location. Roof top and patio restaurants are only a 2-5 min walk from the hotel. There were convenient stores and a pharmacy on the same street for easy access to essentials. 20 min walk to the Toronto Island fairy. Parking was very close to the front entrance of the hotel. Although checkout was at noon, the parking is until 4pm which made it worry free to spend the rest of the day enjoying the city of Toronto.",

Questions are answered and guidance to the room elevator is presented. A fast accent to our floor. My wife comments\\u201D wow they must have just cleaned because this elevator smells fresh\\u201D.

Our room staff were friendly and did a fantastic job. A than you to the hard working, realty seen ladies of Toronto Hyatt",
            "We have stayed in multiple hotels across several areas in Toronto and this was our first time staying at the Hyatt Regency on Queen Street West (We have though relaxed in the lobby before while waiting for a musical to start at a theatre a few blocks down.  And as Taz says, \\u201CBut I digress\\u201D).  Located directly in the Theatre District it is certainly a great spot if you are seeing a show, in fact we ran into folks who love the Hyatt\\u2019s parking lot when going to see a show (mental note made!).  We were in town for 36 hours of restaurants, sightseeing and shopping so the location worked out nice for us too.  Upon checking in Mikka took great care of us hooking us up with a free drink each at the lobby bar (a really nice one) to help celebrate our wedding anniversary.  The lobby is modern and spacious and we quite enjoyed our drinks (great pours too) before we headed out to a restaurant a quick walk away.  The room was fine, nothing to write home about, and could have used more outlets (USB too) and better lighting, and did serve its purpose to allow us a good night\\u2019s rest and a central area for lodging.  Our overall experience was positive and we did feel quite welcomed.  It did help too there is a full service Starbucks off the lobby, with a street entrance too, and it was open by 6:30 a.m. allowing us to start our day off strong",
            "Expected a bit more from a Hyatt Regency especially in a downtown location. We booked a room with two double beds which was a bit of a tight squeeze for a family of four though our kids are little. Rooms were very small, bathroom was even smaller and what kind of skeeved me out was that the clean towels were inside the bathroom cabinet under the sink right next to the exposed pipe and the wall behind it just looked gross. I get that for a downtown city location there\\u2019s not a lot of space but they could have put some wall shelves over the toilets for a towel rack like other hotels do or something. The design of the room just didn\\u2019t have a lot of counter space to put your things. Room service meant eating on top of the bed. Beds are springy and hard and the mattress covers were ill fitting and kept pulling off. The remote on the TV lagged so trying to change the channel was an exercise in frustration. \\nOn the positive side, rooms were pretty clean and the lobby is nice. There is a Starbucks in the lobby, which though we didn\\u2019t use it,  Is convenient. Location was terrific as it was a short walk to the tourist attractions like CN Tower, aquarium and several other destinations along with great restaurants. If we\\u2019re in Toronto again will probably try a different hotel as the Hyatt was just ok for the price",
            "My daughter and I travelled for her birthday to Toronto for an overnight adventure. I wanted a hotel close enough so we could walk to Ripley\\u2019s and the CN Tower. With a 7 year old it was only an 8 minute walk away, so the location is great. The staff were helpful and beyond expected friendly. A few staff had left a birthday card in the room and signed it which made my daughter feel quite special. We were on the top floor (20th) the view was nice. The bed was very comfortable and the Chrome Cast made watching Netflix for daughter a breeze. The hotel was clean and overall noise level quiet, even given it was a Saturday night. I cannot comment on the food as we ate at 360 and had to leave before breakfast. The restaurant did appear posh. I\\u2019m sure it would have been of good quality if we had the chance to eat there. Upon checking out we were offered bottles of water for the taxi ride to the airport. The gesture was appreciated. I would recommend this hotel.",
            "Super customer service and central location. Walking distance to Rogers Centre, CN Tower and more, plus a street car stop on the next corner. The beds were very comfortable and the room was a decent size. Upon check-in we switched our room from the back of the hotel (construction noise) to the front side (CN Tower view) and found it very quiet. The rooftop pool is nice and the gym is huge. They give fish food to kids to feed the fish in koi pond in the lobby. We were able to leave our luggage at check-out time until our flight later in the day",
            "Great location as this hotel in located in the entertainment district in Toronto but don\\u2019t book this hotel unless you are prepared to \\u201Cwhisper\\u201D between the hours of 9pm to 7am. There is no mention of this when on their website, no mention when book and no mention when you check in. You will be notified of this policy by the sign posted at the elevator when you are bringing your bag upstairs to your room. Unacceptable. It\\u2019s still light out at 9pm. I completely understand a policy from 11pm to 7am. This is a nice hotel, great location and the staff are lovely. But don\\u2019t make the mistake of booking this hotel if you don\\u2019t want to \\u201Cwhisper\\u201D on a weekend away.",
            "We go to Toronto every couple months at least.  We started going years ago for our wedding anniversary.  We have stayed at a number of hotels near the entertainment district and this was our first time at the Hyatt.  1st I will say this is the first hotel who did nothing for our anniversary.  Like I said we've been going for years.  One hotel has sent up a bottle of champagne, one sent up a desert with happy anniversary written in chocolate, one has sent up a card with a fruit tray, one gave us free deserts in the restaurant, and so on.  We were told happy anniversary when we checked in so I guess that's something.\\n\\nPros:  The location is amazing, Kings Street has a number of cute restaurants (our favorite was hey lucy's).  It's super close to Roger's center, Scotiabank, Ripleys, CN Tower, etc.  The bed is really comfortable and they have great space to put away clothes.\\n\\nCon's - The show is your basic tub with a curtain.  The tub is very slippery.  The lay out is a little strange getting to our rooms, we were back in a corner area that we had to go through many doorways to get to.  To get to our room we almost always had to wait in line to get to the elevator taking us upstairs.  Parking is a complete rip off.  The place you park is a private garage that charges $10.72 for a full day of parking but if you're staying at the hotel you have to get a parking pass were the hotel charges you $32 a day for parking.  The elevator area coming up from the parking garage smells like a dirty diaper but it does seem like a secure place for the car.  Room service was very quick but the food was so greasy that I couldn't eat more than 2 bites.  They do have black out curtains but they do not pass the window so expect a lot of light in the mornings.\\n\\nOverall I would stay here again because of the location and comfortable bed but if you're celebrating a birthday, anniversary, etc.. the Hilton is the best and Marriott branches near here aren't too far behind",
            "We visited Toronto for the first time and stayed at the beautiful Hyatt from October 3rd-10th. It was wonderful and really enjoyed our stay. The staff was great, the hotel was beautiful and very clean. The hotel is in a great location with lots near by within a 5-10 minutes walk and only a 20 minute walk from the Eaton Centre.",
            "Our family stayed in a deluxe suite for 3 nights. It\\u2019s the perfect location if you are taking in one of the many theatres in Toronto.  The check-in was smooth and the front desk very courteous. The outdoor swimming pool was beautifully heated.  Parking was a bit difficult to find. We found however there were just too many issues with the room itself. The air conditioning was very very weak. Maintenance tried their best to fix it but wasn\\u2019t very successful. The internet was virtually non-existent  in the room and the room itself was very dimly lit. The toilet needs to be fixed as it continually runs at times. A simple hitting the handle again usually resolves the issue but it\\u2019s just another issue that needs to be addressed. The TV in both the bedroom and the main room is also very dimly lit...most likely has been set that way to save energy and money but quite difficult to watch TV when it\\u2019s that dark. The bathroom is also quite tiny. The door inside barely can close.  Is the hotel a good value for your money? Not really. We probably would not stay there again. The downtown Hilton and the Radisson Blu Harborfront are better 4 star hotels.",
            "This is a great location for downtown Toronto with a 10 minute walk to Rogers Center and the CN Tower.  The room was small but well furnished.  It was easy to get extra towels and there's plenty of food options within easy walking distance.  The room was small and some of the areas in the hotel could use some updating.  The pool is great and was warm for us",
            "Another good Hyatt Regency to add to my list.\\n\\nWe had a regular, no view, 2 queen bedroom with a promotional stay 2 nights get the third free.  I had no expectations from this hotel.  We were in Toronto and meant to be outside all the time.\\n\\nIn the end, I was impressed.  For 408 $ for 3 nights, we had a very clean room that was a little tight for 4, but very well thought out and renovated.  We had a coffee maker and fridge, a small work desk, the 2 queens and a large TV.  There were some drawers in the wall, and the bathroom was tight but efficient, with room to put our stuff underneath the sink.  The beds were very comfortable as were the linens.  We had plenty of towels and they came to give us more after a few minutes.  They even delivered to us wine glasses.\\n\\nService was really good and generous with directions, and location, excellent.  There were tons of restaurants just outside and it was an easy walk to the CN tower, the waterfront or the financial district.\\n\\nNice surprise for us, they were very clear on the website and when we booked that the pool was closed.  In the end, it had just opened as we arrived.  We liked the pool with its buildings view and the deck they had to suntan.  In a non-COVID world,  there was even room for a bar up there.  It must be fun!\\n\\nThe downside that we saw as we were leaving is the parking.  With the hotel it was 32 $ a day.  At the pay machines in the same garage, it was 25$ per 24hrs.  We could have saved a few bucks.\\n\\nWould definitely recommend to friends and family",
            "We spent a night here when we came to Toronto for a theatre event.  The Hyatt is conveniently located in the Theatre District and easy walking distance to the Princess of Wales and Royal Alex theatres along King Street.  Parking is underground and pricey at 32 bucks but once parked everything is close.  \\n\\nOur room was on the 14th floor with minimal view, whatever view there may have been blocked out by ever multiplying high rise condos.  The room was comfortable, more than adequate for an \\u2018overnighted\\u2019.  Very comfortable king bed and very quiet location, slept great!  The room design was ok but I didn\\u2019t like the bathroom pocket door, too easy to pinch your finger in the framework like I did :(.  Complementary coffee (Starbucks) is nice but more powder creamer please!\\n\\nWe didn\\u2019t eat in any of the hotel restaurants other than coffee in Starbucks so can\\u2019t comment on those\\n\\nChecking in and out was seamless, all staff very courteous and friendly.  I would recommend this hotel for one or two night stay",
            "This Hotel is in the best location Downtown Toronto and very close to all attractions. The Tram literally stops directly in Front of the hotel and makes it very easy getting around. The Front Desk Personnel is very friendly and helpful. Even though the Property needs an upgrade, our stay was still very pleasant. Multi Level Underground Parking for a reasonable cost and very convenient",
            "The staff is excellent at this property, and the location is great for access to the business district and PATH Underground, along with the Bell TIFF Lightbox, theatres and Blue Jays, Raptors of Leafs games. It is also in the heart of the Entertainment District so there are many bars, restaurants nearby. it's perfect to book for work and play when the day is done",
            "Stayed here for three nights while in town to see a concert at Budweiser stage. The hotel is in a really good location and within walking distance to many of Toronto's major attractions. There are TONS of restaurants and bars nearby as well. We're not from the area and didn't even know the Caribbean Carnival festival was a thing until a couple days before we arrived. The hotel did a good job of managing everything. Despite all the festivities taking place that weekend, our room on the 18th floor was very quiet. I'm surprised at how well we slept given the volume of people celebrating late into the night on the streets below. The room itself felt a bit dated. The bed was hard but comfortable enough and the room was relatively spacious, especially for a room in a major city. I feel like it's a bit overpriced for what it is if you pay the rack rate, but we redeemed some World of Hyatt points and didn't end up paying anything out of pocket. Overall staff were helpful and pleasant. If I were to write a review based on the room itself I'd probably only give it 3 stars, but I'm so impressed by how well the staff managed the high volume of people coming in and out of the hotel on a crowded holiday weekend. They have a great team of folks working there.",
            "We stayed here for two nights at the beginning of March. The hotel is located right downtown, so it\\u2019s convenient to most amenities, very close to the Rogers Centre. Underground parking is good and they do have spots for larger vehicles which was a great benefit for us. The room was extremely large with a separate bedroom which was good to stay up and watch TV without bothering anyone. The one thing I found odd, it had a fridge, coffee maker, sink\\u2026 but no microwave. While we were there the restaurant was being renovated but they did offer breakfast, which was good and expensive like everything else in Toronto. The staff throughout were very friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.  I\\u2019d definitely stay here again if need be",
            "We recently spent three nights in a suite with our son at the Hyatt Regency Toronto.  The hotel is a bit dated with the rooms needing some updating and elevator reliability addressed.  The lack of window coverings in the living room area was also problematic, as our son was unable to sleep there with the sun coming in.  \\n\\nThat aside, it was a terrific experience worthy of five stars.  The location is walking distance to plenty of restaurants and sites, and conveniently has a Starbucks in the building and a pharmacy next door.   The pool was nice sized for a city pool and well heated with great views of the surrounding buildings.  We appreciated having a real crib for our son (as opposed to a pack-and-play) in our room at check-in.\\n\\nMost important, the staff at the hotel was the best we've ever encountered.  Every person we encountered was pleasant, kind and helpful.  Patrizia Carlos at the front desk stood out with her kindness and helpfulness, even following up by email after we checked in.  The servers and host in the restaurant were wonderful.  We will certainly return",
            "Visited Toronto to celebrate my friend's 40th birthday. My husband and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency and upon entering, the hotel is stunning as it gives a very modern, chic vibe. The customer service was excellent. There is a bar and restaurant there but we did not visit either one as we opted to dine at restaurants nearby.  Self parking is available but the parking garage is very tight. The only issue I have is the hotel room is dated and needs a few upgrades for the price charged. There was a mini fridge in the room but no microwave. The hotel is nearby various restaurants and tourist attractions.",
            "Me and my family were recently at the Hyatt Regency Hotel in downtown Toronto and could not be more happier because the hotel room that we stayed in was super cleaned, had a beautiful view of Toronto, and the staff at the hotel helped out my family in various way through food service, clean blankets, and more.\\nThank Hyatt Regency for making me and my family vacation a total pleasure. Highly recommended it",
            "Stay was excellent and rooms and halls were all nice and quiet. very peaceful to be in, staff was amazingly friendly and helpful with all needs. I would recommend to anyone traveling to Toronto as the hotel is in prime location to reach anywhere downtown either walking, transit or car, a commute of 15-35 mins",
            "My experience at the Hyatt Regency Toronto was perfect.  I came up to Canada for my birthday weekend and the hotel did not disappoint in any way.  The centralized location of the hotel allowed me to walk, tram, or subway to all of my destinations within 15 minutes of leaving my room.  The main \\\"touristy\\\" attractions nearby are the Rogers Centre, CN Tower, Ripley's Aquarium, and Scotia Bank Centre, but there are an abundance of food options, scenic areas, and parks nearby as well.  The gym was extremely clean and had plenty of machines covering many types of exercise, including a great rowing machine.  My bed room was also extremely clean and everything was fully functional.  The hotel room view was beautiful as well.  Each staff member was friendly and went out of their way to be helpful when answering questions.  They were especially helpful in terms of assisting me with public transit.  On my departure date, I was even able to leave my luggage with the front desk while I enjoyed a few hours at the Royal Ontario Museum before my flight.  Three different front desk people helped me out, and they were all kind and helpful, so you don't have to worry about which one you get.  The hotel is located just a short train ride away from the airport which made getting in and out of the city very easy.  I have already recommended this hotel to my friend who is taking a similar trip next year.  Thank you Hyatt Regency Toronto for a 5 star stay",
            "I read some negative views about this hotel, but have to say my experience exceeded my expectations. The hotel is centrally located, less than a 15 minute walk from Union, Kensington Market and the Eaton Centre. And surrounded by restaurants, cafes and shops. \\n\\nCheck in was easy (although the hotel was busy!) the front desk clerk took the time to answer all of my questions, and even managed to get me a room with a view upon request. The room was a good size, I saw many complaints about them being small but having stayed in many Toronto hotels, these rooms were among average in size. The bed was lavish and comfortable. \\n\\nThe hotel did not have many offerings for food and drinks, but why would you want to stay in when you could explore what Toronto has to offer? The staff here were amazing, you could text a number for extra resources (water bottles, towels etc) and they would be delivered to your door within minutes! Parking was $32 a night, comparable to other lots and they let you stay until 4PM on checkout day",
            "i stumbled over the Hyatt in Toronto by accident due to a very bad airbnb experience. This was a repeat visit. I find the staff fantastic, dinner in the downstairs restaurant King Street Social was excellent (prix fix 3-course dinner for CDN$48). The rooms are comfortable and quiet. Better yet is the location on King Street - walking distance to everywhere - great choice of restaurants, cafes, organic food market (Spadina\\u002FKing street), PATH, Union Station, cinemas and theatres. Fitness centre clean with a decent array of equipment that works. It can be great value depending on occupancy level. For instance this trip was first week of January and room rate was ~CDN$200 per night. In November it was ~CDN$350 per night",
            "the rooms were great and the conference rooms large. The hotel is located in a great place in downtown Toronto. Just about everything you could want to do is a few blocks away in case you want to go out at night. The ground floor and the conference room floors are spacious and modern.\\",
            "The Hyatt Regency Hotel Toronto enjoys an excellent location in the heart the downtown core coupled with exemplified superior servicing.  Overall, an enjoyable stay in a well appointed room with outstanding sleep quality accompanied by a staff that knows your name and who are willing to go above and beyond the call of duty.\\n\\nAs a side note, there is no question that this establishment ensures the highest cleaning and hygiene standards and proactive care in these COVID-19 times. Decidedly worthy of a return engagement.."

            "We read good reviews on this website and thought the location was convenient since it's a few blocks from the train station. Upon seeing the front of the building, we were worried. It  looked run down, and upon entering the lobby looked even worse. Pipes with insulation hanging off them came out of the ceiling, and everything needed a coat of paint. We got the key to our room and went up in the elevator. The room wasn't completely uninhabitable, but for $130 a night I was expecting something better than a flophouse. \\n\\nMost of the furnishings looked ancient, the rug was obviously old and not clean, and the room was an odd shape and also very dark. The only window looked into a brick air shaft. \\n\\nWe went to the desk to complain, and they explained that there weren't that many other rooms in our price range. We got the keys to a more recently renovated room on the 2nd floor, but it wasn't much better. The light-colored rug was almost black in front of the door and the room was tiny. The window was about 5 feet about the floor with a through-the-wall air conditioner below it. \\n\\nWe checked out and found a room at the Day's Inn Hotel next to the old Maple Leaf Gardens. It was quite a bit cheaper and MUCH nicer. It even had a view. Don't stay at the Hotel Victoria, you will regret it. There are much better bargains around Toronto if you look",
            "Unobtrusively tucked away on Yonge Street,  the historic Victoria is what I would consider to be a little gem.  We spent only one night here while in town for a concert, but we would definitely come back again! Our party occupied two Deluxe Twin rooms - one on the seventh floor, and one on the 2nd floor. The one on the 7th floor was definitely the better of the two (much larger, and with a better view), but both rooms were clean (the bathrooms scrupulously so), and the atmosphere was an oasis of quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a big city. In the case of the Victoria, \\\"old\\\" does not mean run-down -- indeed, it was much better maintained than many slick new establishments. While lacking in some of the amenities ~ such as a heated pool, a workout center, an in-house restaurant, and room service ~ that some people might consider necessities, we found the Victoria to be charming.  The Victoria is an excellent choice at a very attractive price point. It was within reasonable walking distance from parking and many downtown attractions. The continental breakfast was light, but ample; the staff congenial and helpful",
            "A hidden gem in downtown Toronto.  Selected a deluxe queen, and it was just as pictured.  8-minute walk from Union Station, and walking distance to many downtown attractions such as Hockey Hall of Fame, restaurants, and shops.\\nWe arrived early, and after a brief wait, we were able to check-in.\\nWe will definitely be back.  Thank you Hotel Victoria for a great experience",
            "A couple of years ago, I stayed here for the first time for one or two nights. It was by far the best-value mid-range accomodation I've stayed in in Toronto, because it's downtown, close to the train station and comfortable. I've travelled the world and have stayed in a wide range of accomodations, and the room where I stayed in the Hotel Victoria stands out in my memory for its cushy bed and nice bathroom.  Other places I've stayed in the city were overpriced and far-flung, or merely far-flung and cheap but not worth it. \\n\\nSince I'll be travelling by rail between Montreal and Windsor, I've decided to give the Hotel Victoria another go.\\",
            "I thought it would be worth it to stay really close to the main attractions in Toronto, but next time I'll pay the cab fare and stay somewhere else.  The room hardly had any standing space after I put my two pieces of luggage down.  The washroom had no amenities, neither did the room (there was no space for amenities anyway).  There was absolutely NO VIEW, and the staff basically ignored us since we were young.\\",
            "Having stayed in a dozen Toronto hotels on business over the years, this one was certainly the worst. I was charged $500 for an extremely modest room - tiny, outdated and uncomfortable bed, glitchy TV and a small window overlooking a brick wall. The room was inadequate, but the real problem is the price point - I was charged $500 which is obscene. When I asked if there may have been a price error, I was told that it included free water (!) and bath gowns.\\nThe hotel advertises itself as a \\\"boutique hotel\\\" which is very misleading - it has none of the charm, services, amenities or quality one would associate with that category. The hotel has no lobby or restaurant",
            "I discovered this hotel through Tripadvisor. I was looking for a place that was reasonably priced, given the fact that it was downtown, and a place that was conveniently located. Thankfully, this hotel delivered both and we stayed 3 nights. This place is excellent!!! Note: my review is for their DELUXE room.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\n1) Rooms are clean, new, and modern. Incidentally, I'm pretty sure the paint in some of the hallways was only a few days old. Our deluxe room came equipped with all the standard stuff but it also had a mini-fridge and, surprisingly, free all-you-can-watch Apple TV. While I didn't watch a lot of it, I did watch some and it was great. The place has a boutique feel.\\n\\n2) Location is Yonge St. This place is a 5-minute walk to Union Station, the Hockey Hall of fame is about a block down, there's a 24-hour grocery store that's accessible with a short walk, it's about 10 minutes walk to the Harbourfront, etc. The short of it: location is top-notch; you can walk everywhere. There's a Subway literally next door, along with a restaurant in the hotel, and Starbucks and Shoppers Drugmart are a block away.\\n\\n3) Staff. They were professional, helpful. Any problems we had were quickly taken care of. Even the cleaning staff were keen to help out when we had issues with our TV.\\n\\n4) Free Wi-Fi. Needless to say, many of the so-called top-tier hotels still charge for this in 2012. Hotel Victoria's was consistent and quick and hassle-free.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\n1) While the rooms were new and clean, the hotel clearly had some issues with its building contractors. The room flooring must have been installed hastily because it creaked pretty much everywhere you walked on it. While the bathroom was also clean and new, the tub was already pulling away from some of the sealant between it and the tiles. These were just minor, incidental things, but they were noticeable.\\n\\n2) The curtains didn't fully darken our room. The light from outside kept the room brighter than it should have been at night",
            "We stayed Jun13-15 in the Queen deluxe on the 7th flr. The room was exactly the same as in the picture. The beds were comfy and rooms were very clean. Recommend keeping the fan on to cover street noise. The window blinds do not cover the windows and makes for a very bright 7am. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The restaurant on site was more expensive than Sunset Grill which was only a few blocks north. This hotel is in central downtown within walking distance of shopping, the Rogers Centre and the harbour.  We would definitely recommend this hotel to couples who need a comfortable room to sleep after enjoying the sites of beautiful downtown Toronto. We look forward to our return visit",
            "We were very happy with Hotel Victoria.  The location is close to so much and easy to find.   There is a fantastic restaurant across the street (Irish Emassy pub) and the hotel has a great breakfast restaurant attached...not cheap but excellent food.  Our room was very small but nice and the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in.  Our friends had a king room so they had a bench and a couple of chairs so thats where we visited.  The staff were lovely.  We felt the value was great and will stay here again.  Parking is expensive and awkward but that's Toronto.  All in all we were very happy with our choice",
            "Abbiamo preso una stanza businnes, interni piuttosto nuovi e dotata di tutto il necessario, anche il bagno sufficentemente grande e nuovo.\\nAssenza di pargheggio dell'hotel, pertanto essendo in centro \\u00E8 un impresa trovarlo a un prezzo decente, giusto nei weekend si paga poco in quello del centro commerciale sottostante, comuqnue i bagagli dovete scarrozzarveli in giro.\\nPosizione centralissima in una delle arterie principale che taglia Toronto, a 2 passi da tutto veramente comodo",
            "Disclaimer:  I am not being compensated in any way to write this review.  I'm just an occasional traveler.  The Hotel Victoria is in downtown Toronto, about a 12- to 15-minute walk away from the train station (Union Station). It's a boutique hotel with rooms that are on the small side, but nicely appointed.  Breakfast was not included with the room.  We stayed two nights in September 2019.\\n\\nThe hotel itself is nice enough, but the front desk could really use some training on interacting with the public.  We had originally booked a Deluxe King room. After checking in, we discovered that the room appeared to be on the other side of the wall from the elevator.  We went back down to the front desk and asked if we could be moved to another king room. The woman told us that all the king rooms were basically in the same location on the various floors.  She offered a queen room and she and my wife went back upstairs so my wife could check out the room.  On the way, the front desk woman stopped by the king room that we had originally booked and told my wife she had to check it to make sure we \\\"didn't take anything.\\\"  After this insult, we should have just canceled our reservation and found somewhere else.  We ended up staying two nights and then moved on to a nicer hotel (that was actually cheaper) in the same area downtown",
            "We stayed in the renovated rooms (asked for them specifically on booking) and they were fabulous.  Our rooms were richly appointed with excellent quality linens and other furnishings.  Apple TV was available, as well as wireless internet service (free).  The lobby is gorgeous, and the staff friendly and helpful.  We noted that housekeeping was meticulous and everything, from rooms to common areas were clean and tidy.  You cannot beat the location of this hotel on Younge Street.  You are within walking distance to CN Tower, many fine restaurants, and trolleys that will take you to many great points of interest.  The downstairs restaurant is also pretty good - food is great (especially for breakfast), and prices are reasonable, although service was so-so.  Value for money is spot-on here, and we would definitely recommend.  We shall return",
            "Stayed a few nights and it\\u2019s location is great absolutely amazing! Walked to scotiabank arena for ice hockey game, CN Tower, Ripleys Underwater World, St Lawrence Markets etc. Great cafe just down to he street. Room compact but big enough! Very clean! And for you Pokemon or Wizards Unite fans my avatar flitted between 3 Pokestops and a couple of inns",
            "We spent two nights at the Hotel Victoria aug 5-6. We had a queen room and like previous posters have said the room was very small. The location was great as the Wife being a shop-Alcoholic had a short walk to the Eaton Center and I being a avid baseball fan had less than a fifeteen minute walk to the Rogers Center. Lots of great dining choices near by and the noise from Yonge Street wasn't a problem, just the odd siren like any other downtown hotel. As there is no onsite parking We parked about 8 minutes away on the esplanade at a manned parking lot at the end of church street. $30.00 for two and a half days which wasn't too outrageous. Would We return to the Victoria? Likely if the price was right but We like to try different places so not likely anytime soon.\\",
            "Will definitely come back and stay again! Located in Toronto's city center, subway station is in 2 mins away. Although this is a over 100 years historical hotel, but you can merely find it old. The water pressure is great, no pipe noise and with decent room rate. Recommend to young travelers who want to explore this charming city in a convenient way",
            "My first experience with this hotel was when my boyfriend and I arrived in Toronto and missed the turn for the parking lot. We got very lost because of all the one-ways and could not figure out how to get back. I called the hotel for help and the woman was quite rude. Saying things like \\\"That's what I just said\\\" and \\\"That's what I'm trying to telling you\\\", etc (I took down her name but I accidentally deleted it). When we finally got parked (which was a NIGHTMARE) and got to the hotel, we checked in. We stayed for four days, three nights, and the staff never once said hello to us as we were coming in or going out. That is not \\\"superior customer service\\\" (as is said on their website). The room that we had, which was a standard queen was very small, however since it is a boutique hotel it was what I was expecting. The room was fine but there were markings all over the walls in the bedroom and bathroom. There were pieces of wood missing from the walls and the wallpaper was peeling. There were also black stains on the sheets and a mark on the head board. On the website it says that the bathrooms and guestrooms are newly renovated but if that is true then either they don't take good care\\u002F clean properly or they just didn't do a good job. The sink was old and cracking and there were tiles missing in the shower (the website makes it sound like the bathrooms are large but the shower was TINY, I could barely fit in it. When I dropped my razor it was almost impossible for me to pick it up. I feel that I must add that I am 5' 7\\\" and 120 pounds so I am not a big person.) Also the toilet was wobbly. The website says that the hotel (guestrooms and bathrooms) are newly renovated but it appears that only the lobby was. On the Saturday that we were there it was raining and so we asked the man at the front desk if he had an umbrella that we could borrow. He looked at us suspiciously and asked us what our room number was. When we told him, he gave us an umbrella and said \\\"make sure you bring that back\\\". When we went outside and opened the umbrella it was broken and wouldn't stay up. With all that being said, the hotel was in a great part of town and we enjoyed being close to many things",
            "Arrived tired after a long flight from England to find that our room had been cancelled and sold to some one else. They had informed me, I later found, by e-mail whilst I was on the plane. We were then given a small room with a double bed that I had to share with my sister before moving to our booked room the next day. We subsequently found out that there were 2 conferences on in Toronto that day so all hotels were full. The staff did not care, were not apologetic, never smiled the whole time we were there. We were offered a free buffet breakfast as compensation - wow!!!\\nApart from that the beds are very comfortable and the hotel is in a good location in Downtown Toronto. Would not bother to eat in 'Over Easy', the Marche just a minute down the street is much better, cheaper and has a huge choice.\\nThe staff in this hotel need to definitely go on a customer service course as they have a 'do not care, not my problem attitude' - not a good advert for visitors to Toronto",
            "We booked a four night stay at Hotel Victoria in Toronto for a holiday vacation (December, 2013).  We were convinced by the internet pictures and descriptions of the hotel as a charming place to stay, and by the description in Fodor's 2012 guide to Toronto and Niagara Falls.  Our bottom line: the experience was so awful that we spent a good part of the first evening in the hotel finding another place to stay and checked out the following morning.  There were so many things to dislike: the room we stayed in was tiny and claustrophobic.  The bathroom was so small you essentially were in danger of tripping over the toilet upon entering the bathroom.  The heating system was absolutely terrible: the vent poured out heat at an extremely high temperature, and there was no way to modify it.  When we turned the heat off, we were freezing.  We spent the night with the heat on as low as possible and the window open, and got up continually throughout the night to adjust the heat and modify the degree to which the window was open.  There was no good solution to this problem:  we were alternately hot and sweating or freezing cold.  Fodor's indicated that a \\\"pro\\\" of the hotel was \\\"gym privileges at nearby health club.\\\"  This is absolutely misleading.  First, there was a hefty fee to use the \\\"nearby\\\" club; and in addition, it was several blocks from the hotel, which is not appealing when having to make a trip back after a work out.  Another problem was location: there was not much around at night, so options for meals were limited.  The only positive thing we can say about this hotel is that staff were gracious in allowing us to leave without penalty.  \\n\\nOne final comment: for people who still use print travel guides: my experience over years is that Frommer's is consistently reliable, Fodor's is not.  The only reason we used Fodor's guide is that we could not find a Frommer's that was as recent as Fodor's.  I will never pay for a Fodor's guide again",
            "Great location poor hotel.\\nThe hotels location as great within walking distance of most if the tourist locations in Toronto.but the hotel look like it's been renovated on the cheap.

            "My husband and I stayed at Hotel Victoria in Toronto for three nights in early November, 2011.  Very disappointing...we arrived around 7 pm amid traffic.  There was no designated unloading space for our car.  There is no valet service and we had to unload our car by ourselves.  The staff person on duty was of no help and was very dismissive of our need for assistance.  We got to our room and found it was located next to the elevator so we aked for a different room based on our reservation request.  We did get a new room, but were told we might have to move later.Fortunately we did not have to move.  Although the room was pleasant, the bathroom was in need of serious repairs.  The wallpaper was coming off all over.  Our room swipe cards never worked and we had to go to the desk almost every time we came in.  The day staff was more helpful.Overall, we were very displeased with Hotel Victoria and would not recommend the hotel",

            "We stayed at the Hotel Victoria for 3 nights during an amazing holiday in Canada. The hotel is in a perfect situation for exploring the city, as it is steps away from the subway (king), and an easy walk to Union Station. From the airport we took an airport bus to Fairmont Royal York (opposite station) and walked to Hotel Victoria.\\n\\nWe has a King room with a huge comfortable bed, fridge and coffee making facilities. Everything clean and tidy, and most important to us at the time good air-conditioning, it was 35 degrees at the time..phew.\\n\\nNo complimentary breakfast, as there were alterations being made when we were there, but there are places just down the street to eat, Richtree market being the best.\\",
            "We had a great experience overall! Here's my summary:\\nPros: location right on Yonge St can't be beat! We were attending an NHL game and the walk was 10 minutes. Tons of pubs and restaurants all minutes away. Value; can't be beat for a hotel nestled in downtown Toronto. Decor is modern elegant meets old fashioned charm (it was built in 1909!). It was Clean! I cannot stress enough about how important that is to me! Staff were friendly for check-in\\u002Fcheck-out.\\nCons (not really cons but I'm trying to be objective here): very tiny room. We didn't much care though since we were literally just sleeping there and leaving the next day. The hotel does not have parking available. The place they recommend is 10 minutes away (but affordable). The building is very old so 'soundproofing' is non-existent. Not much can be done about that. \\nI would stay here again, hands down",
            "I was here for one night on business.  I did a lot of calling around as I am familiar with Toronto and its hotels, this was by far the best value for a limited budget.\\n\\nRoom was clean, bed was big and comfortable, desk was a little too small, view was non-existent but that was fine by me.  Location is great, right downtown, although parking is a pain; I parked at Nathan Phillips Square because all the local parking lots go astronomical for weekdays, so I parked from 3:00 Sunday to 3:00 Monday afternoon for less than $20.00, although I was a ten minute walk from the hotel.\\n\\nWish I'd known about the free internet as I would have taken my laptop; I ended up on a late night run up Yonge St. to an internet cafe to obtain some information I could have gotten for free in my room.\\n\\nPrice is the best thing; it's pretty high season in Toronto, but it was only $135 for a queen room for a night; lowest alternative was $179.  This place is better located than the HoJo on Avenue Road and Bloor, although the latter is a bit cheaper.  I'd place them in the same ballpark quality wise.\\n\\nPeople complain about no restaurant and bar.  I don't get it - Toronto has hundreds or thousands of great restaurants and bars, who would eat at the hotel?  Great Irish bar right across the road where I capped the night with a couple of pints.  Lots of restaurants within short distances",
            "I usually book my hotel reservations on line. I choose the location then read some of the reviews and look at the pictures of the rooms and facilities. This is one of those few times that when I entered the room, it looked exactly like the picture on line.Of course I was very pleased. I loved that they had wooden floors and had those sofas at the foot of the bed. The room was clean and fresh. i reserved for a queen room with two queen beds like I usually do but the space in this room was much larger than the past ones I have been to.\\nNo restaurant in the hotel, but I did not mind because it was at the center of downtown Toronto and we planned to dine out. I would highly recommend this place. Slept like a baby and very satisfied customer",
            "Foi a segunda vez que ficamos no hotel. Est\\u00E1 melhor ainda. O quarto parecia ter sido renovado. Bom atendimento. Muito bem localizado.

            "To be honest with you, I was little bit worried before staying at the hotel after the reviews we had read on the site. This was our final stop on our 4wk trip around Canada where we had stayed in delightful b and bs and small inns. I even went as far as checking the web for any last minute deals at another hotel.\\nWe were very surprised by the accomodating and friendly staff at the front desk who provided maps and organised our tour to Niagara. When we checked in, they even notified us that the rate quoted in our email had been reduced because of specials they were offering. We were surprised that our room was modern, clean and comfortable. There was plenty of room (we stayed in a deluxe room with queen bed).\\nFor breakfast, they served warm muffins, croissants, bread, and cereal. Not bad for a meal that is included in the rate. The breakfast room was a bit dark, and small. The lobby, and lift could do with a bit of a face lift, but the most important was our room.\\nThe hotel is a few minutes walk to Eaton Centre, Air Canada Centre, and CN Tower. The subway is only a few steps away. Excellent location.\\",
            "We recently stayed at this hotel for one night as we were attending a hockey game at the Air Canada Centre. It is located within walking distance and is very close to restaurants, pubs, etc.\\nThe added bonus is if you are attending an event, you can show your ticket on check-in and you will receive a discount on your room.\\nThe hotel room was clean and very comfortable",
            "Clean facility, Courteous Staff, the bed was overly comfortable! Just a fabulous base to work from for Hockey Hall of Fame, Rogers Centre, CN Tower, Eaton Centre walking distance to ALL! I will Happily Return",
            "I was a bit apprehensive at first, after reading some of the reviews; however, I was pleasantly surprised once I arrived at the hotel. We arrived early in the morning, although check in is only at 3, the staff made arrangements for our room to be ready for us to be able to rest. During our wait they offered a complimentary continental breakfast, took our baggages, so we could eat, sit and relax while we waited. Within a half hour our room was ready. Now that's service !!\\n\\nThe rooms were very nicely decorated, very clean, a bit on the small side but I really didn't mind, you have plenty of room to move around. The bed was comfortable, the rooms were quiet, we had two great nights of rest.\\n\\nThe complimentary continental breakfast had a good variety, cereal, muffins, toasts, croissants, cookies, fruits... everything fresh and delicious.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly, greated us everytime we came by the lobby. They were helpfull answering all our questions about the city and what to visit.\\n\\nWe will definitely be staying at the Hotel Victoria again on our next visit to Toronto.\\",
            "My main requirements for a hotel are nice decor and cleanliness, and the hotel delivered on both counts. I had a standard queen room for three nights on the seventh floor (room 707). I'm a bit paranoid about bed bugs, so I examined the sheets, mattress, duvet, pillows, etc. when I first arrived, and it was all perfectly spotless. In fact, the whole room was spotless, and it was cleaned nicely each day while I was out. I have (over)sleeping issues, so on the second night, I hung the \\\"do not disturb\\\" sign on my door and slept in till about 2:00pm. No one bothered me, and when I came back to the room at night, it had been cleaned. My compliments to the cleaning staff!\\n\\nThe location of the hotel couldn't be better: it's a couple blocks from Union Station, and right in the  middle of the Financial District\\u002FOld Toronto (so lots of gorgeous architecture nearby). There's an entrance to the subway about a block up Yonge Street, many fast food restaurants, coffee shops, and restaurants very close by, and the Eaton Centre is a short walk away. \\n\\nThe bed was extremely comfortable (as everyone seems to agree), the decor was tasteful, there was plenty of lighting, you could adjust the temperature in your room, and the window opened, so you could get some outside air. The shower head had excellent pressure. I liked that the floors were not carpeted - it's more modern and to me, seems cleaner. Only thing is - the hotel's website says the floors are hardwood, but I'm pretty sure they're laminate. In any case, they're nice. The tv was right across from the foot of the bed, and had cable. There was no bathtub, which wasn't a problem for me as I wouldn't have used it anyway - I only point this out because I notice the website says that standard queen rooms have \\\"spacious bathtubs,\\\" which my room didn't have.\\n\\nThe only thing I would change (and I imagine the hotel wants to change as well) is that there is a little space between the glass shower door and the little retaining wall that is supposed to keep the water within the shower unit, meaning there is usually some overspill of water onto the bathroom floor. It wasn't a big deal to me, as I just put a towel there to collect the overspill, but I think it's damaging the wall below the shower over time. \\n\\nIn response to the typical complaints of those who gave the hotel two stars or less, their complaints tend to centre around these areas, which I will respond to so readers can make informed decisions:\\n1) Parking. If you're driving to the hotel, this could be an issue for you if you're not prepared to walk a bit. I took the train, so there was no problem. I wouldn't want to drive in Toronto anyway.\\n2) Lack of bars\\u002Frestaurants\\u002Froom service\\u002Fetc. In my case, I never take advantage of those amenities anyway. I think it's much more interesting to get out of a hotel and explore the city, go to a different place for breakfast each morning, observe the locals, etc. If room service and a mini bar are important to you, keep in mind that this hotel doesn't have them. I believe it does have an onsite breakfast and lunch restaurant, but I didn't go to it, so I can't review it.\\n3) Views from your hotel room window. I'm sure some rooms have views, but my room had a view of the grey brick wall of the building next door. This didn't bother me at all, because I know what the city looks like, so I don't really need to see it while in my room. Also, it means I never had to shut the blinds. If you want more natural light while in your room, you might want to consider requesting a room that doesn't face a wall. There's quite enough lighting in the room otherwise.\\n4) The shower unit was not large, which was not a problem for me, as I'm not very big, but I imagine if you were a larger person width-wise, you might feel crowded. But I only had a standard room - perhaps bigger rooms have bigger bathrooms. \\n5) Noise from the street. I had a room facing a brick wall on the 7th floor. With the window shut, there was no noise at all. With the window open, you'd occasionally hear a honk from a car, people shouting, and so forth. However, I have a tip for travellers ANYWHERE - bring a pair of foam drugstore earplugs! Then street noise\\u002Fnoise on planes or trains won't bother you at all! \\n6) Unfriendliness of staff. I didn't find any evidence that the staff was unfriendly at all. I met what appeared to be a maintenance guy in the elevator, and he even asked me how I was enjoying my stay. I found the front desk people friendly enough. Probably it depends on what mood you catch people in. I never had any problems to address with them, so I wasn't in a bad mood myself.\\n\\nOverall, I would say that if you're a traveller who regards a hotel as mostly a place you retire to at night for sleep (and want to be clean, comfortable, and modern), then you'll love this hotel. If you regard the hotel itself as your holiday, you might want to look elsewhere (because there's no room service). \\n\\nAlso, I believe the hotel was quite recently renovated, so keep this in mind when reading older reviews, because their negatives are probably no longer applicable",
            "I was more than pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I arrived late and was welcomed quickly and warmly by the desk staff. It took minutes to check me in, and I was in my room. The hotel must have been renovated because for such an old historic hotel, it was very modern and comfortable. I could hear some street noise outside, but I couldn't hear a peep from surrounding rooms in any direction.\\n\\nThe bed was very VERY comfortable - I slept like a baby in it. Highly recommend it for the beds alone!\\n\\nAnd I have to comment on the cleanliness... because I was trying to squeeze lotion out of their provided little bottle in the bathroom when the bottle exploded on me... But what impressed me as I wiped up the lotion from the hardwood floor was those tissues did not have a speck of dust or dirt on them - this was one super clean room! Can't be sure it would pass one of those tests they do on the shock shows, but I can't think of many places in a Toronto winter with floors that clean!\\n\\nThe hotel is located on the Eastern edge of the \\\"PATH\\\", Toronto's underground city. You still had to step outside to access the PATH, but it was literally next door so not too bad given how extremely cold it was when I was there. The hotel is close to Union Station and the business district (all accessible by the PATH - but ask for a map otherwise you'll get lost!). \\n\\nIt wasn't very close to any stops made by the airport express bus - the nearest stops were about 10 minutes walk away (I imagine the Union Station bus stop was once upon a time close - until they began whatever is causing the monster construction there that has shut down the streets in that area for a few years now and the bus has to detour to quite a ways away...",
            "My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Victoria.\\n\\nPros\\n1. Hotel is clean and well maintained.\\n2. Staff were polite enough - they could be warmer and friendlier but nonetheless acceptable and par for the course in a big city.\\n3. Compares favorably against other establishments of similar rating and room rates in both USA and Canada. \\n4. Room is well-decorated, spacious and extremely comfortable with clean and new linen and towels, cable TV, iron and ironing board, coffee maker and free WiFi internet (which works!)\\n5. Conveniently located to shopping, restaurants and, for those keen on walking, within walking distance of the business district and many tourist attractions including the Hockey Hall of Fame, the Waterfront, Air Canada Centre (Toronto Maple Leafs), Roundhouse Park, CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Wayne Gretzky's, Roy Thomson Hall, Canada's Walk of Fame, Eaton Centre, etc.\\n6. Hockey Hall of Fame is only a 2 minute walk away.\\n7. OverEasy, the onsite restaurant, serves fantastic food for breakfast and lunch, at reasonable prices.\\n8. Great Burger Kitchen is a 5 minute walk away at 9 Church St. Possibly the cheapest food within walking distance of the hotel, yet the burgers were fantastic! Especially important as most restaurants in the immediate area are costly.\\n\\nCons\\n1. No on-site car parking. Note that there is a City of Toronto (Green P) municipal parking facility nearby at 2 Church St. It is a covered and secured parking station for about $14 per day. While the carpark is nearby, it was slightly inclined uphill and very inconvenient with large luggage bags.\\n2. On-site restaurant, OverEasy, is not open for dinner (wish it was!)\\n\\nSummary\\nI have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, particularly at the discounted room rate I was lucky enough to secure, plus the convenience of location to the primary attractions we wanted to visit eg HHOF. Would we stay again? Yes definitely.\\n\\nI am giving the Hotel Victoria 4 Stars, not as any suggestion of hotel star-classification, but as a reflection of our satisfaction with the establishment. A thumbs up!\\n\\nA humungous thanks should you rate this review as helpful. Happy travels",
            "The location of this hotel in downtown Toronto can't be beat.  There are stores and restaurants and museums all around, and of course, the Lake isn't far.  We were pleasantly surprised by how quiet our rooms were.  (We stayed in two different rooms on two separate stays.)  We didn't hear noise from adjacent rooms or the street.  And the hotel is right on the Yonge street subway line.  The rooms were perfectly clean.  Many reviews of this hotel mention poor lighting in the rooms.  The hotel must have added lamps recently because, with the lamps and the overhead light turned on, the lighting was certainly adequate.  The front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful.  But there were some drawbacks.  The rooms are very small, and they don't include a chair.  Neither of our rooms had a real chair, although the second one had a low leather stool.  Not comfortable for sitting on.  There's no fridge or microwave in the rooms.  Also, there was no closet in either room.  There was a metal rod about 12 inches long in a corner, with a few hangers on it.  If you travel with a lot of clothes that you like to hang up, this hotel is not for you.  The view out the window in both rooms was of a brick wall.  Don't go to this hotel expecting views of downtown Toronto or the Lake.  The elevator is very slow.  And there was no restaurant or snack shop in the hotel, so we had to go out every morning for breakfast.  But there are plenty of places for breakfast within a few blocks.  All in all, the drawbacks are minor if you're going to Toronto to see the sights.  Just be prepared for the limitations.",
            "Stayed here for a night while attending a concert nearby. Location itself is central & close to entertainment & restaurants. We were fortunate to have good weather and were able to walk everywhere. Reception staff were great. Our room itself was comfortable, clean & bigger than I expected for a boutique hotel. The decor is modern. My only complaint would be the noise from early morning street traffic below which I\\u2019m sure is typical for downtown Toronto. I would stay here again.",
            "H\\u00F4tel bien situ\\u00E9 pour visiter Toronto car il est pas tr\\u00E8s loin de la CN Towers. Petite astuce si vous voulez \\u00E0 CN Towers passer par la gare vous irez plus vite.

            "The location in Old Toronto is great. Within walking distance to the water.\\nThe hotel itself appeared nice online but was very different on arrival. \\nNo shuttle to or from the airport. The shower in the room had a large gap in the wall that was unfinished with tile or grout. Seemed like a good place to grow mold. \\nRequested a different room and was moved to another floor with a room that had a broken air conditioner.  Moved again to a 3rd room. The rooms were very small. The room had no full length mirror. The towel rack fell off of the wall when I picked up the towel. There is only 1 ice machine in the entire building and it is in the basement of the hotel.\\nThe staff was very friendly and tried to be accommodating, but this place is kind of a wreck.  \\nI will be back to Toronto, but will find better options in the future",
            "We just returned from Toronto and stayed at the Hotel Victoria on Yonge Street from June 11th-June 15th. I was hesitant at first because of the other reviews posted but from past experience I decided to go with my gut, and with what Frommers had recommended. \\n\\nI made the reservation online and received a prompt response. About a week before we left I emailed them and asked to ensure we received a non-smoking room. I just didn't want to take any chances and all was perfect upon arrival. We checked in about one hour ahead of schedule which was nice b\\u002Fc we wanted to get out and about asap. The staff behind the reception desk seemed to change often which we found amusing. They were all pleasant, not overly, but pleasant and easy to deal with. \\n\\nAs indicated in other reviews, the room was small but clean, and this was more important to me. Clean is a must. The bathroom was quaint and our view was, well, a brick wall but we spent very little time in the hotel room so we weren't worried. The temperature rose as the week went on and the air conditioning worked well. Each day we returned to find our room spotless. The one drawback was the lack of a munchie machine in the hotel. This sounds silly I know but when Game 5 of the Stanley Cup is on you need your munchies. There was a pop machine and ice machine in the basement though. \\n\\nNext door to the hotel was a little newstand\\u002Fconvenience store. We only noticed it on day 3 or so and wish we had found it earlier. It was called International News. The woman there was so nice and welcoming and very chatty. It was great. She asked where we were from and where we were going, etc. This was a great place to grab snacks to sneak into the Jays game. The only problem is it closed around 7pm, but that's ok. The woman there made up for it. \\n\\nThis hotel is all about location, location, location. It was about a 5 min walk from the Eatons Centre. Yonge Street is incredible, full of shopping and restaurants. I highly recommend Eggspectations just up the road and Shopsy's across the street. Yum. It was also practically right next door to the Hockey Hall of Fame. This made it easy to run around, come back and rest a minute, and then keep exploring. \\n\\nThe one thing I really liked about Hotel Victoria is that they were not all gushy over us. We would come and go, they would say hello, and that was about it. The night before we checked out I was stressing b\\u002Fc our flight was only at 8pm and the thought of dragging our luggage around terrified me. I asked the girl at the desk (I think her name was Carla?) if they would keep our luggage after check out for the day and she said it was no problem and it would be locked up until we returned. Fantastic. This was a big help and a huge relief. \\n\\nOne more thing...we never heard a sound from the other rooms or even in the hallways.\\n\\nIf you want a pool, a fabulous in house restaurant, and lots of room....do not go here but if you want good value in a great downtown location then this is the place for you. And I'm picky so trust me.\\",
            "This boutique hotel was very nice. Everything was super clean. The room was a little small but fine for us since we were only staying one night. We were able to check in a little early which was nice. There is no parking but they directed us to a municipal lot a couple blocks away. We parked there overnight and paid about $38CAD when we left the next day, which from my understanding is pretty decent for downtown Toronto. It was nice to be right in the city and be in walking distance to a lot of things. Overall a great value, I would definitely stay here again.",
            "Weekend trip for a show at the Royal Alexandra Theater. We love this location, tons of restaurants within walking distance. Eaton Centre area about 10 min walk. Walk to theater also 10 min. Easy check in with a delightful staff member. Rooms and bathrooms are tiny as with all hotels of this type, but when you're not there much who cares? We were also three adults so could manage sharing one small bathroom (full length mirror outside the bathroom helped). Mini fridge was an unexpected perk; due to small hotel, no ice on every level, have to go to basement - easy or someone from front desk will bring to you. We blew a fuse with hairdryer; a maintenance person came up within five minutes and problem solved. Sadly we forgot a pair of shoes in the closet; happily, hotel kindly accommodated and sent the shoes to us for $25. Love that service! There is no parking specifically at this hotel but there is a structure just around the block on Wellington St (Indigo Pkg Garage), for $30 (American) per night, AND lots of spaces for charging electric vehicles, a pleasant surprise. Would highly recommend this lovely place",
            "Great location, close to everything in Toronto, a short walk from Union station. A quiet boutique hotel with very patient and helpfull staff, great for us as we just got off a transatlantic flight. Clean all over with everything you need. Good breakfast with a good selection of food to chose from. \\nA bit small rooms, but still we wanted for nothing",
            "My boyfriend & I stayed for two nights to attend the Muse concert at the Air Canada Center. It was a last minute reservation and I hadn't been in Toronto for years, so I went quickly through some reviews online to find a good spot downtown. The hotel is at very short walking distance of the subway, Union train & bus station, many restaurants and cafes, Eaton Station (10 min), CN tower... But most of all, it offers you this quick access to all the attractions without the boredom of a chain hotel. The lobby itself is quite beautiful, and the room we booked was cool-looking and very clean. We both agreed it was the most confortable bed we ever slept in! The only downside for me was the Wi-Fi connection: while it was free, it was very (very!) slow, and we were located on the third floor. Also, Yonge St. does get noisy even late a night, but nothing earplugs can't deal with. \\n\\nI would definitely stay there again",
            "Advertised as a boutique hotel, Victoria Hotel delivers on its promises. First, the location is terrific.  Just about 3 blocks from the train station, 1 block from subway and streetcar, near many restaurants, it makes a great base for anyone spending any amount of time in Toronto.\\n\\nOur room was small,  but that was expected. Because it is a heritage building jammed between two new buildings, most of the rooms do not have windows (\\\"fake windows\\\" with a bit of light). If you need a \\\"real\\\" window, you'll need to book a room in the front overlooking Younge Street (probably more expensive).  The room had everything we needed, although the A\\u002FC unit was quite noisy.\\n\\nStaff was friendly and helpful.  All amenities in the rooms. Note that there was no porter to help with the luggage ... not an issue for us.\\n\\nGREAT choice for downtown .... the amenities without breaking the bank",
            "Hotel Victoria has a great location near many of Toronto's attractions, if you are looking for the fast pace of downtown Toronto. Our family booked two rooms and both were very clean and beautifully decorated. A continental breakfast is included, and the croissants were delicious! The hotel staff is very friendly. The only drawback is that the hotel does not have parking facilities. The closest public parking lot is about 3 blocks away and it will add up if your stay is longer than a night. Overall, staying at Victoria Hotel was very pleasant",
            "My sister and I were looking for a cheap, decent hotel in downtown Toronto that would be close to all of the major attractions and public transportation.  For the price (compared to other hotels downtown), I was expecting this hotel to be strictly budget.  It far exceeded my expectations.  It's recently remodeled and it shows.  For $144, we got a deluxe queen room with a mini fridge.  The room was extremely clean and very chic.  The view wasn't the greatest (the windows were dirty) but there wasn't much to see except the stores across the street.  It was very quiet and a great place to crash after hectic days of sightseeing (we stayed for three nights). \\n\\nYou won't get an incredible view like some of the hotels downtown, parking is a pain (I suggest relying on public transportation if you stay here), and there is no pool or exercise room.  It was, however, an extremely good deal for the price, clean, cute, and up-to-date.  The location cannot be beat (you can walk to the lake, the CN tower is a quick streetcar ride away, and the King subway station is a short walk up the street).  I honestly cannot imagine staying anywhere else if I ever visited Toronto agai",
            "We flew into Toronto and took the public transport from the Airport to the Hotel - you end up on the subway and you can get off near enough to the hotel to wheel your bags no problem. Its simple and v cheap.  We left Toronto after 2 nights by train and walked to the station from the Hotel - we are fit and able and suitcases are on wheels but it was an easy flat walk.  The room was excellent, lovely big comfortable bed, fab sheets and all very clean. The room had a small fridge and coffee machine, old but ok a\\u002Fc, good bathroom and huge closet with iron and board.  There is a great restaurant a few doors down from the Hotel called Marche.  It serves every type of food and drink you could wish for at any time of the day. Its also opposite an Irish Bar.  I booked a king sized deluxe bedroom in advance, we got a room on the top floor with king sized bed and it looked like the top floor was finished!!!  Other floors look like works was still ongoing.  Being high up the city noise and buzz was not a problem but don't expect a view.  We walked everywhere in the city from the Hotel, it really is well situated - staff were friendly and helpful, they booked us a table for supper at CNN tower without a problem",
            "My fiance & I just got back from a wonderful weekend in Toronto.  We picked Hotel Victoria because it was less than 5 minutes walking distance to the ACC and other attractions that we wanted to go to.  Also, Expedia had a 'web special' rate on the hotel for $105 + tax.  The Hotel itself and our room, were very clean, and the frontdesk staff were helpful and offered us an early check-in.  Parking for the hotel was not included, but very close by in Commerce Court on Wellington St.  For approx  28 hours, our parking fee was $24.00, which was reasonable.  We also ate at \\\"Over Easy\\\" the adjoining all-day breakfast restaurant.  The restaurant was very clean and bright, and the food was fresh and homemade.\\nIf you're looking for good value (by Toronto standards) on a night's stay with lots of nearby amenities, and nothing luxurious, this is an excellent pick",
            "The Hotel Victoria is perfectly located on Yonge Street, one half block from a subway station, ten minutes walk from Union Station, and within walking distance of the best Toronto has to offer.  If you are looking for more than location, however, you will be disappointed.  The clean, comfortable rooms are small, (approx. fifteen feet square with ten foot ceilings) with an adequate bathroom.  There is only one small elevator.  We paid approximately $375 for three nights, with an additional $47 to park our car in a nearby garage.  If you are into pools and spas and pampering or are traveling with children, this is definitely not what you're looking for.  If, however, your goal is to blend into the city and explore, you'll be very pleased.\\",
            "I've stayed at many hotels in Toronto on business trips that I pay for myself. So I was happy to have everything I needed, no creepy carpet or bedspreads in this spare room with free wi-fi. This is a no frills hotel. This hotel does not provide room service meals or in house restaurant, It is close to good restaurants though. My room had no view but it did have a window so I could let in air and light. You can pay extra if you want pay per view movies, otherwise, you get basic cable which is fine for daily news. It is close to the subway and major streetcars, right downtown so many destinations are walkable.\\nThere is a breakfast restaurant with standard breakfast fare and bad coffee. Convenient if you're not fussy.\\nMy room did have an annoying design flaw in the tiny bathroom, allowing the shower to leak all over the floor, needing many towels to mop up after.\\nStaff was friendly",
            "This is a budget friendly hotel near to all major attractions in Toronto. You can even walk to all point of interest from this place. Price is basically affordable. Rooms are small but cute. If you\\u2019re not choosy about size this works for people on budget. They have a small lobby and a famous restaurant where they served good food at a low price. Staffs are very good and friendly. They are not too strict on check out time, and you are allowed to leave your luggage with them"

Told some staff what she did to me and they said how nasty. Asked to fix things in lou and staff refused. Cold in my room. No privacy in living room with no windows. Asked staff for taxi and disrespectful towards my name. Dogs barking, Etc. Never again stay at this hotel and will find another place. Also had bite marks and perhaps it as bed bugs",
            "Had to review! Stayed twice in 1 week, seeing 2 rooms, 1 with kitchen and 1 without. Both were perfectly clean, spacious, well decorated and comfortable.  The staff was very helpful; you got the impression, they all wanted to make sure your stay was the best it could be. Parking ($30 per night) was a little pricey, but easy to use and very convenient, appreciated. The atmosphere on colourful Church street and the convention shops surrounding the hotel greatly added to our seamless, stress free stay. You\\u2019ll definitely feel safe.  Across the street and south 100m is a great coffee shop in the morning and a pub in the evening, providing a perfect start and end to your day.  Do not hesitate to stay at this hotel, period",

Staff was very informative and detailed. On what hotel offered. Hotel offers complimentary breakfast from 7am again lounge is nicely decorated and updated. Has a pool and sauna for your personal use.   Hotel is in an amazing location close to all attractions and walking location to shops. Hotel staff was very helpful Assisting with our needs. Room was modern and nicely decorated. Only thing about this hotel is there is a $1000 deposit required for stay even though we  only spending one night. However due to the hotel amenities inside the room fridge stove microwave and newly update could understand why. When booking wanting great location and feeling the comforts of home away from home this is a great place to stay",
            "I booked this hotel because others in the Yorkville Areo were extremely expensive. While the outside of this hotel doesn\\u2019t look exciting, I was very pleasantly surprised at the inside of the room. It looks like a chic simple New York City modern apartment.\\n\\nOnly con is the breakfast situation - at peak time (730ish - 830), forget about getting in there peacefully.  Better to go out on the streets for a pastry.   \\n\\nLocation is amazing.  Staff friendly",
            "We recently stayed at the Town Inn Suites.  Room were newly renovated, clean, tastefully decorated, spacious, comfortable, and well equipped.  Nothing was lacking.  Staff was cheery, friendly, and super helpful.  It was a truly wonderful experience.  I would highly recommend this place.  Also great was its perfect location to restaurants and shops",
            "The location is good but in a bit of a sketchy area. It is close to subway and Bloor and Yonge which is a plus.  \\n\\nThe walls in our bathroom were filthy and gross with marks all over them.  There is water damage in the unit we were in. \\n\\nThere is but one towel rack in the bathroom and nowhere to hang a wet towel.\\n\\nDo not park in the lower level of the basement as there is NO access to the hotel from there other than to enter a very dark stairwell which leads to the street and around the corner from the entrance.  We mentioned to staff about being unable to open the inside door which is supposed to lead to the elevators (we tried both the room key and the garage access card) and having to navigate the dark stairwell but the door wasn't unlocked nor were we given an explanation on how to open the door by the time we checked out the next day. We were definitely locked out. Don't park on SB, only on B. The entrance on B floor is always open as they put duct tape over the lock mechanism so it doesn't close.\\n\\nUpon entering our room (on a day when it was 31 degrees outside), the AC was set to 78 and the windows in both the living and bedroom were open.  It was so humid. Neither window closed properly and we had to remove the screen to close it as much as possible (because the balconies are inaccessible). The bedroom doesn't have its own AC and despite asking in the evening for a fan, it remained a good 5-10 degrees hotter in the bedroom than in the living room.  The AC worked but didn't go into the bedroom - it was very humid and warm.  We didn't even need a top sheet when we went to sleep because it was so warm.  They did provide a fan but it wasn't a standing one and really didn't help much at all because it was so hot in there. \\n\\nAlso, for paying guests, they shouldn't be charging $40 per night when there are cheaper parking lots in the area.  $30 would be more reasonable for paying guests.\\n\\nFor one night, $300 (including the parking) wasn't worth it.  If you're picky, don't stay here.  If you're willing to \\\"make do\\\", it's ok",
            "We come with a group of 20+ people. The prices are really fair for the rooms we got. Spacious living room with a lot of facilities such as dish washer. Though it's a pity the balcony could not be accessed. Pool and gyms are closed due to the Covid. The staff were super helpful with the recommendations and even helped us to find agencies to book some trips. The service was fast when we needed something. Great location as well,  the street behind the hotel has a lot of restaurants and bars. Close to Eaton Centre",
            "Nice location, walking distance to street cars, restaurants. Staff were friendly. They are very welcoming at the reception, unlike at the hotel we went for an overnight stay in Montreal. Didn\\u2019t expected the complimentary breakfast which is nice and not in a bag. Fresh croissants. Amenities in our room is good",
            "Stayed at this hotel a few times now. It has been a good experience every time. The staff all around were courteous and easy to deal with. Had one minor issue and it was dealt with quickly and resolved. Location is great and rooms are comfortable, clean and spacious. All around a thumbs up. Will be going back next time I'm in TO",
            "Great location in Toronto. We stayed in a two bedroom suite with kitchen. The kitchen diner was great with loads of space and air conditioning however the rest of the apartment was tired @nd needed updating. No access to the balcony and a tiny windowless bathroom. No air conditioning anywhere except in the kitchen diner. Continental breakfast was limited in variety. Lots of space and facilities for a group of five however I would not stay here again unless all areas were update",
            "Location is fantastic, 5 minutes from bloor  and yonge and subway. The appartements are fully renovated with full kitchen. The staff is uber friendly and helpfull. The hotel is very clean and well maintained. Too bad that they are getting rid of the pool to build a gym. Good value",
            "I stayed in a suite here for 2 weeks while looking for somewhere permanent to rent. My suite was perfectly fine, not high end luxury but not budget either. It had quite a large kitchen and living space, a bathroom (with a shower but not a bath), and a separate bedroom. I wasn't here on holiday so it was nice to have some form of kitchen to cook with. The kitchen had most things you would need.\\n\\nThe bedroom was a little on the small side, partly because there was a huge king sized bed and not much room for anything else. The bathroom was nice, but I had some problems with the hot water in that I had to leave the shower running for 30 minutes sometimes before it got to a reasonable temperature to shower in. Since moving into a condo in Toronto I have the same problem, so I wonder if it's a common thing here.\\n\\nThe wifi was a little slow but functional. I had to sign in again every 24 hours which got irritating given I was there 2 weeks.\\n\\nI stayed here during the COVID-19 pandemic and I was self isolating here after arriving in Canada. The staff were mostly accommodating of this. The only issue I had was requests getting misinterpreted when calling down to reception for something, usually ending up in them bringing the wrong thing or too much of something which was wasteful. Because of the circumstances during my stay, the location made little difference. But if I were getting about, I think I might have found the location a little too far away from the centre",
            "My wife and I spent 5 nights here. The location was close to the gay village neighbourhood and high-end Yorkville Ave. We were able to walk to most things we wanted to explore. \\n\\nThe hotel room was a cute, cozy, and clean apartment. We had a full kitchen, living space, bedroom, and bathroom with a rainfall shower. It was everything we needed to have a relaxing space to enjoy after a long day of exploring. \\n\\nWe only used housekeeping once since we were only there a few days. If we requested clean towels or toilet paper from the front desk it was brought up in less than 5 minutes. \\n\\nA classic continental breakfast of muffins, croissants, yogurt and fruit was provided each morning. \\n\\nWe stayed in a \\u201Cluxury king suite, one bedroom\\u201D booked through Hotels. ca and the room was wonderful. I\\u2019d stay here again",
            "Beautifully renovated, still a few dings in walls etc but very clean. Very attentive staff and clean quiet rooms that look exactly like the photos. Breakfast is continental style but well stocked(except for missing sugar which was quickly rectified). Breakfast room is small so plan on  taking breakfast back to your suite. Location feels safe for a solo female traveller, and has a convenience store across the street. Bloor and Yonge are a short walk away.  \\nThe slippers are a lovely bonus. \\n\\nRegarding some reviews - Anyone who is a seasoned traveler should be aware that hotels do require credit cards. This is a long time well known practice and should not come as a surprise to anyone, it's not the hotels responsibility to inform you directly",

Easy enough access to other parts of Toronto if you have a car as we did but had we been on foot as per our original plan I would have regretted our choice.\\n\\nThis was a very reasonably priced hotel so it\\u2019s difficult to fault it - apart from the lies the air con told which ruined my stay at least",
            "We booked this hotel at the last minute, which is not normal for us but we had some circumstances that made it necessary.  This is the most we've ever paid for a room. $290 per night Canadian,  There were plenty of great things about the hotel, especially the location that was convenient to Toronto's wonderful public transportation system and good walking as well.  There were supermarkets nearby.  The desk staff were friendly and I appreciated that they wore masks.  It was handy to have a kitchenette in the room and the bed was notably comfortable.  Trips of 5 nights or more came with a free airport pickup, which worked as planned.  The shower was good with plenty of hot water.  I liked that they had recycling in the room.\\n\\nWe often stay at low budget hotels, and this place was less clean than most.  Attached are some photos of just a sample of the stains and food that were smeared on the wall when we checked in.  There was a weird stinginess about the place.  For example, the room came with a dishwasher and we stayed 5 nights, but they only provided us with 2 dishwashing detergent tabs.  There was also a coffeemaker, but for two of us they provides a total of 4 coffee pods.  The room was serviced once during our 5 days, which was okay if they had let us know but it was strange they didn't tell us and we started to get overflowing trash.  There are some cooking implements but no hand dish soap, salt, etc.  We bought a bunch of breakfast food when we arrived because their website said breakfast was discontinued due to Covid, but when we left the first morning we saw that they were serving breakfast.  They have one instant coffee machine that folks were lining up for, with pastries, apples and yogurt.  The balcony looked inviting but was locked for unexplained reasons",
            "We booked a suite here for a 4 day stay in Toronto. The suite was fairly spacious, but in our suite there was not so much as even a small refrigerator or a coffee maker. There was a balcony that was locked, so no way to access it.  The bathroom would have been good, but there was only one towel rack in the whole place. The rooms seemed cold and needed something to warm them up, such as throw pillows.   Breakfast was short and sparse. It ended at 9 AM. I got there at 8:50 to an empty coffee pot. I asked the attendant to bring more coffee. She smiled and said, That's It for coffee for the day. Unbelievable! What kind of hospitality it that? The breakfast room was tiny, not even close to big enough for a hotel this size. In short, I found this hotel to have lots of potential, but very little of it was realized. They need to up their game",
            "I had stayed at this hotel years ago, and I was aware that hotel had gone through renovations but did not know what to expect..  When I booked room originally there wasn't two double beds room available online.  When I checked I asked if one was available, the manager quickly looked into it, and was able to give me a suite, at nominal increase in price.  When I walked in the room I was totally surprised how beautiful it was.  It was very modern, clean, and comfortable, the suite was very large.  It had stove, microwave, dishwasher, where I made good use of the appliances, during my 4 day stay.  The cleaning staff was a very sweet lady, and accommodated me with towels, toiletry, dish washer detergent, etc, I had told her it was ok not to make beds etc, I would take care of it. The location is great spot, close to many amenities, restaurants, shopping, few blocks away from Bloor St.  Wi Fi was free, and used it a lot for work and leisure. I was pleasantly surprised of this hotel and will plan to visit there again",
            "Stayed here for 5 days. The staff are extremely  helpful and efficient and have a professional  style. We were upgraded to a lovely apartment before we left Australia  perhaps  because  we mentioned  that we were on our honeymoon!! Jun couldn't  do enough for us with emails back and forth, prior to us beginning  our trip across  Canada. The Deluxe King Suite was lovely..even has a kettle!!! Kitchen is very modern with good appliances  and full size oven and stove top. Large microwave oven, and very large stainless steel  fridge. The only minus was the free breakfast.  Very basis choices indeed..\\nThere is a decent grocery store at the corner of the next block, which is a few minutes  walk ( a convenience  store is directly across from the hotel) (didn't go to that one). A hairdressing  salon is just around the corner and Croissant  Tree restaurant  is diagonally  opposite.  This eatery is great for any time of the day meals or snacks. Very cheap quality food in a nice setting.. There is a coin laundry in the hotel and an indoor pool. Dog friendly  too. Definitely  would recommend this  hotel",
            "I have nothing but great things to say about this place and those working here. I was a little apprehensive at first when I checked in Sept 2021 for a month as I am currently a resident of Toronto, in transition to moving to another city in Canada. But this hotel really feels like my own apartment; Neat and clean, organised and located in the heart of downtown Toronto. Check in was smooth. Also the photos online are the same as that of the suite; brand new appliances and furnishing. The staff here from front office to cleaning to maintenance, everyone is nice, courteous, friendly and quick to respond especially the Office Manager Vishal Mistry. I am quite impressed by his exceptional client service. As I was happy with my first month stay that I ended up extending for Oct as well. My big Thank you to Town Inn Group for making my stay pleasant and memorable.\\nBest wishes  \\nWill see you again :",
            "At first we thought this place was a bit out of the way and we should have stayed at the waterfront.  Well actually Church Street was the right choice, located on Church between Wellesley and Bloor\\u002F Yonge on the subway it was actually a really good location.\\n\\nWent for the bigger apartment (which we probably didn\\u2019t need) and appreciated the space.  Though a little tired the place was clean and well run.  Really comfy bed.  Perhaps a better range of TV channels for non Canadian visitors.  I wouldn\\u2019t have minded if they were in English or French, just a bit more choice.\\n\\nBreakfast is why I have marked the star rating down.  Breakfast is served in a small room that would seat probably a dozen people.  The food doesn\\u2019t vary and if staying for more than two days you are likely to tire of it.  Let\\u2019s just say it\\u2019s an interpretation of a continental breakfast.  But that\\u2019s not why you are in Toronto. Right?  There are plenty of places nearby to get breakfast, but that\\u2019s a pain to feel that you need to, having the cost already in your price.  It\\u2019s probably a better idea to grab breakfast, head to the lift and have it in your room, especially at busy times",
            "Needed a simple room and got a nicely equipped suite. Very surprised when we walked into a suite that cost less than half of a single room. Heart of Toronto, walking distance to almost everything and yet quiet at night. Staff was amazing and very helpful.",
            "I was a participant in a conference in Toronto, near Church and Bloor Streets, and the conference chose this hotel, since it's nearby.  I was favourably impressed.  I don't understand the very negative reviews, and I think there may be an agenda behind some of them.  I do understand the mildly critical reviews; yes, the property is aging and the decor isn't bright and fresh.  I can also see how some might find the neighbourhood a bit sketchy, especially with current construction, though some Torontonians find it rather trendy.  But I liked the large rooms, open space, well equipped kitchen, comfortable bed, and well functioning plumbing in the bathroom.  There's nothing like room service, which I almost never use anyway.  But against that is the low price by Toronto standards.  At the front desk I got delayed a bit by what was described as a misunderstanding between the conference organizer and the hotel, though I think the misunderstanding was on the hotel's side.  The staff was friendly about it though",
            "I booked several rooms for the family and got a group rate as we were coming down to Toronto for a wedding. The service was excellent, they were very accommodating and the rooms were nice, clean and very spacious. Only thing that was not so great was that my sister got an older looking room on the 2nd floor and everyone else got nice renovated rooms in the higher floors. I would recommend this hotel to friends and families",
            "We needed a hotel room large enough for 5 women on a \\\"girls night out\\\" and this place fit the bill. We enjoyed the comfort of the two bedroom suite which allowed for a night of card playing, socializing, and cooking h'orderves after we took in a play and had dinner out. It added to our Toronto experience !!!",

I didn\\u2019t mind to pay for the parking because it was reasonable. But it could be awesome if it were free",
            "Nice clean well equit rooms.  In ideal location for exploring Toronto near to a subway station. Staff friendly and helpful.\\nThe only issue was with breakfast as the room was tiny so had to take food back to the apartment to eat. Also only opened till 9am for breakfast felt this should have been longe",
            "An absolutely wonderful location, just off the shopping on Bloor Street and a short walk from UofT. \\nRooms are spacious and somewhat functional but with all necessary amenities. The staff is friendly and accommodating \\nThere is a daily cleaning service but more attention could be given to ensure that the room is vacuumed more often \\nOverall, a comfortable sta",
            "My family and I, including 2 cats,  had to find an affordable place to stay while we were putting our condo on the market to sell. The location had to have a full kitchen and enough space for us all and more importantly would allow flexibility on the duration and of course accept pets.  Town Inn Suites was just the spot in the city. Super friendly, kind and professional staff, amazing location, clean and very diligent when it came to bring us items we needed",
            "The main advantage of this suite hotel is its Yorkville location near downtown Toronto and various amenities.   Our suite was spacious and clean but there were significant maintenance problems that made (especially the bathroom) very unappealing (e.g., bubbled up paint, wall paper peeling, cracked tiles, rusted bathtub drain); I will post some photos.  The suite did not have a safe for the storage of valuables and we were not given access to a fitness center (having been told that it is \\u201Conly open for personal training now\\u201D). Most staff were not wearing masks but were helpful.  The main problem was the poor maintenance (see photos)",
            "The room are fully equipped with Kitchen amenities, they are spacious and comfortable. This hotel is centrally located and easy access to subway and food outlets. Also it is safe location for families who intend to visit Toronto.  Their front office Manager Mr. Vishal was very helpful as he was always available to address our concerns",
            "We have stayed at Town Inns for extended periods three times in the past year, each stay was very good and we intend to return on our next visit to Toronto.\\n\\nIn April 2020 we stayed for a month during the height of COVID in Toronto and then again in September for 10 days, no problem.  In both cases the staff were very supportive in adapting to our particular needs; all requests were solved quickly and very willingly.\\n\\nThe apartment itself was modern, clean, and visited regularly by staff almost daily to make sure we had everything needed.\\n\\nIt's a great location close to all amenities within walking distance, so no car required except for visiting friends in the suburbs.\\n\\nSo a good place for an agreeable stay of a few days or longer",
            "This was my first time at this hotel and I can definitely say that I was impressed.  The staff are extremely friendly from check in to check out.  Housemen and Housekeeping staff greeted us on elevators and were always friendly.  The room was spotless and welcoming.  They offer free breakfast as well but unfortunately we did not go down in time.  Managers on duty for PM and AM were amazing as well, very helpful and accommodating.  They stored luggage for us to walk around for a while before we left the city.  I would not hesitate to stay here again, this will be my go to place when I go to Toronto.  All of this made my short trip even more amazing, so thank you to all the staff!",
            "Fantastic place as your close to where you want to be.  After travel in 3 time zones from Hawaii, Houston and Toronto in one week this apartment hotel is a great place. When I do come back to Toronto this will be the spot to come to from now on as you have everything you need and food stores are a few blocks down the street.\\nI recommend staying at Town INN Suites when you visit Toronto",
            "We took a family suite at $400\\u002Fnight in Nov - parking an extra $30. The suite is well appointed, clean & comfortable. The hotel is very central in D\\u002FT Toronto everything is close. the staff is nice.\\nWhat it lacks is amenities - there is barely enough crockery & cutlery for 4 people, 2 cooking pans, 2 cooking utensils, no paper towels, no salt\\u002Fpepper, 2 tissue boxes, 2 sets of towels, 1 bar of soap for 5 people, coffee pods never replenished. I twice asked the reception for towels which never came. Toiletries were never replenished during our stay.\\nThe heater didnt work, which they came & fixed very quickly.\\nA good place but certainly not worth the price",
            "Stayed in the hotel while on a business\\u002Fpleasure trip to Toronto. The hotel facilities were well maintained and hygienic. The hotel\\u2019s location was excellent. Rajvee at the reception was extremely helpful & polite , going out of her way to guide us. The only shortcoming was the minimalist breakfast spread. The upside to that was the pantry\\u2019s cleanliness. Will definitely recommend this hotel to everyone",
            "We recently went to Toronto from Brockville to see the Phantom of the Opera and were totally amazed with this hotel!! The front desk staff are more than amazing, the indoor pool is heated and the sauna is to die for. Rooms are spacious and clean. We would stay here again in a heartbeat and totally recommend this friendly hotel right in the heart of downtown",
            "I cannot say enough about the amazing staff here. Check in and out is easy. The staff are polite, professional and efficient. I overbooked as I was coordinating for family members and they released the extra room with no penalty and no questions asked. Value for money is synonomous with the Town Inn Suites in Toronto, especially at a time when hotel stays have really sky rocketed. This still feels afordable without sacrificing expectations for clean and comfy stays. Having the extra room of a kitchen\\u002Fliving room and a one bedroom was perfect with multiple wedding guests staying here. The continental breakfast was great - croissants, yoghurt and lots of coffee in a clean dining area. There is parking (extra fee) and a an easy in\\u002Fout drive so that checking in and dropping luggage is a breeze. This is a great place to stay when in TO and not far from key areas of interest. We stayed here a few years ago at Christmas also and happily the consistency from then til now is noteworthy",
            "We had a 2 bedroom suite which was perfect for our family. The room was nicely decorated, clean, the beds were comfy and staff were polite and helpful. There are 2 metro stations within a 5-10 minute walk so it\\u2019s easy to get around Toronto. Would definitely recommend",
            "Very comfortable accomodation to explore Toronto and not to far to Niagara falls! Cooking & washing facilities! There is even breakfast available! A lot of restaurants & shops nearby and the Subway station is only 5 min to go! Very friendly & helbful staff",
            "I am an out of town professional frequently needing a place to stay in Toronto. The Town Inn and Suites  is centrally located and my preferred place to stay.  The Team at the Suites are friendly and professional.  From Ivy who takes the reservation to the Manager Vishal greeting you when you check in.  The Suites are clean, spacious and trendy.   I look forward to my stays. Strongly recommend!",
            "It's not the nicest hotel in Toronto but it checks off all the boxes in terms of everything you'd need from a hotel. Rooms are big with a kitchen, although I didn't use it. There was also a free breakfast, which didn't have a ton of options, but helps with a quick start to the day. The staff are great and I'd probably come back",
            "I would recommend this hotel to everyone who is planning to spend some time in toronto.\\nThe hotel crew are really very fiendly. Especially in the reception a lady called Rajvee was quite talkative and very helpful and very warmhearted.\\nIt is not so close to downtown toronto but still walkable distance. It takes about 40 - 45  minutes if you want to walk, which i like it as well to explore the city. \\nThe hotel is clean, quiet and bed was very comfortable. I would stay again there for sure next time i am in toront",
            "I booked the Junior Suite with kitchenette, and a washer & dryer. These were extremely useful! It had a full-sized refrigerator and stove, and a dishwasher.  The suite was very, very clean and comfortable. I was on a high floor, with a great eastern view (note that there is construction on the west side.) Front desk staff are very professional and attentive. They recommended the purchase of a monthly parking pass to save me money. I also recommend using transit downtown. The Bloor\\u002FYonge subway interchange is less than a five minute walk away, and the subway is accessible (elevators and escalators - at least in the city core). The neighbourhood is people-friendly, and well served by caf\\u00E9s, restaurants, shopping, and small grocery markets nearby. Internet service was very good. I don\\u2019t have cable tv at home, and enjoyed watching that. NOTE: As with many suite hotels, housekeeping will visit only once per week; I didn\\u2019t need anything, but the front desk would have obtained extra towels, etc. I would have stayed longer if I could have, and the Town Inn will be my base the next time I am in Toronto. Book early so you get a high floor and a better view!  NOTE ALSO: if you park at the hotel, there are stairs from the parking garage to the elevators. I managed fine, but persons with more severe mobility issues will need to be dropped off at the front entrance or use the \\u201CGreen P Parking\\u201D on Charles Street.\\nThis hotel is an exceptional value for the city centre. Thank you, Town Inn!",
            "I recently stayed at the Town Inn Suites and was pleasantly surprised. It is centrally located to downtown and the subway. It is very walkable. There are rental bikes nearby if you was to bike around the city. The suites are large with a separate bedroom and kitchen. The rooms are clean. The continental breakfast is basic. I will stay here again if my travels bring me back to Toronto",
            "Went to spend a week-end In Toronto and came across this fabulous place, booked on line. The front staff service was amazing , very happy and welcoming staff. Our room was beautiful, King size bed with Fully equipped Kitchen , living room. Our room was very clean ,everything we needed was there, such an amazing place , parking is on premises , and breakfast offered is across the street. The pool was not opened at this time, understanding, but look forward to our next visit. amazin",
            "I stay at Town Inn and Suites every time I\\u2019m in Toronto. Spacious, trendy, clean affordable Suites. Upgraded and renovated lobby. Front desk staff are professional and kind. Many of the team at Town Inn and Suites have been there long term which speaks volumes of the workplace culture. Manager Vishal is always there with a smile. I look forward to visiting Toronto for business and pleasure largely due to my stay at the Town Inn and Suites",
            "We have stayed at Town Inn Suites many times over the past few years.  It is our \\\"go to\\\" hotel in Toronto.  The rooms are beautifully renovated and appointed suites.  The location for us is perfect.  The staff are very friendly and helpful.  We travel with our dogs and they have an excellent pet policy.  Our dogs are well trained and we respect the property, so we very much appreciated them being able to come with us.  All around a great hotel!\\nSteve & Ro"

            "An incredible stay, within walking distance of yorkville. The hotel entrance was only accessible my room key after 10:00 which made the hotel feel incredibly safe and the rooms were stunning. Unlike any hotel I\\u2019ve been to before. I would stay there again in a heartbeat",
            "Great location on the edge of Yorkville and Church\\u002FWellesley. Staff were just ok. The front of house were brusque and off-hand and there was no visible management  which explained the flat vibe.\\n\\nWe had to move rooms because of loud music coming from the bar every morning at 7.00am (we were on the second floor). Our friends on the 3rd floor had the same problem. We got switched fairly easily to a room on the other side of the hotel.\\n\\nHad two days (out of a 10 night trip) where our room wasn't serviced at all which I think is really poor.\\n\\nThe main thing was the staff though. No good mornings from anyone. No attempt to see how our stay was. No attempt to even offer us breakfast. Interestingly the whole time we were there I don't think I counted more than a handful of people having anything in the morning. There is a good coffee shop which you can access via the bar area although we only found this out my being nosey ourselves.\\n\\nAs for dinner, they have an upscale restaurant called Constantine. But there is no menu to see anywhere in the hotel or even at the restaurant entrance. \\n\\nDrinks on the lovely patio area out front are somewhat spoiled by the fact that they have a very poor choice. Plus it's only open from 4.00pm every day despite being a great asset to the hotel.\\n\\nThis place could be awesome with some care and attention and staff training",
            "Stayed for two nights in the Master Suite. It was the perfect size for me and my partner. Front Desk team was friendly throughout the whole stay. The location is just a block away from Yonge and Bloor, which is a major area for shopping. Did not have a chance to dine at their restaurant (due to COVID restrictions, it closed fairly early), but I am looking to stay again once things open up",
            "I stayed at Anndore House whilst visiting my family in Toronto. My room was large, but sparse, with a malfunctioning television and toilet. I was advised when I arrived that all hotel amenities were closed due to COVID and nothing was on offer to compensate. Instead of a coffee maker there were instant coffee packets. The nice looking bar was closed and no alcohol was in the room, complimentary\\u002Fcompensatory or otherwise, and the only food on premises was $5 glass jars of gummies. Perhaps at another time this would be a nice place to stay, but compared to other hotels I\\u2019ve stayed at in North America and abroad that I have stayed at during the pandemic, this stay was my worst",
            "Loved this location as it was so perfectly located. Bloor Street, St Lawrence Market, Eaton Plaza, Church Street, everything was in walking distance and I loved being so central. The staff was super friendly, always helpful, and the room\\u002Fbeds were very comfortable. All very good",
            "Stayed one night with family. Homeless encampment outside made me nervous. Valet parking cost $45, Public parking garage over the road cost $27 for 14 hours. Nearby MacDonalds and Tim Hortons for breakfast. Very downtown vibe with all the riff-raff around. The room itself was clean and quiet. Room card needed to activate the elevator so that kept undesirables out",
            "In Toronto to see Harry Potter and The Cursed Child. Chose the Anndore House because of its proximity to the Bloor subway station and it is pet friendly. Upon arrival we were asked if a pet bed and bowls were needed for our dog which was a pleasant surprise and greatly appreciated. There is no parking on site but there is a municipal parking garage directly across with reasonable rates. Room was very clean and check in \\u002Fout was very easy and staff were very friendly. Will definitely choose The Anndore House for any future travels to Toront",
            "The Anndore House was a great place to stay and a chnage from normal brand hotels. Although it is part of a very large brand didn't feel like it. The restaurant stays open until 11pm which was good for us as we arrived at 8-45pm from Vancouver and this meant we could get a good meal without having to go out. The rtestaurant was so good that when we arrived back from out Niagara Falls trip at 7pm the following day we decided to eat in th restaurant again",
            "I stayed here for business and it is a very nice hotel. Staff were excellent and the location was perfect for me off of Bloor Street. The loft style room was very comfortable and the hotel room was very quiet for sleeping. All and all an excellent value in a great location for me. Very nice",
            "The hotel presents itself as a hipster joint, and has a nice vibe with friendly staff (at first) and an outdoor restaurant.  The rooms were fine, if a bit worn out, and the daily breakfast for globalists in the coffee shop worked well.  We liked the location, close to transit, attractions, and lots of interesting restaurants.  Unfortunately the last night we were there a very loud dinner party occupied the restaurant space on the first floor between our two rooms.  We had connecting doors with no sound insulation so when I say loud I mean not just that I could hear it but that I had to turn up the TV all the way in our room not to hear it.  When it started at six I asked the front desk about it and they said it would be over at 9.  Which was fine because we went out for dinner.  When it was still going on our return I was told that \\\"quiet time\\\" doesn't start until 11 so I'm out of luck until then.  But were not talking about some intermittent noise, were talking about a large group of people continually yelling to talk over each other.  A few wandered the halls, clearly drunk.  Around 10 I called again they claimed the party was about to end.  I said it really didn't sound like it was ending anytime soon so they offered to move us and discount our last night 50%.  I accepted, and they moved us from our suite to one of their regular rooms.  Here a few days later I find they have refused to discount the last night, saying the offer was to move of or discount the stay.  This I would not have accepted, and I don't like being lied to.  I cannot recommend this hotel, because they clearly value their restaurant business above guest experience and don't stand by their commitments or respect their guests. BTW I went down to check at 11:30 and the yelling and drinking was still going strong.\\n\\nThe neighborhood is great, though, I suggest staying somewhere nearby",
            "Beautiful hotel in a perfect position. Right in the middle of Yonge Street. Lovely large spacious room with large shower room. View from our room was amazing. Hotel was very clean and comfortable. The restaurant in the hotel (Constantines) was very expensive for what it was, especially the drinks, and not enough choice on the menu.This put us off eating there a second time. Hotel staff were accomodating and friendly. Would definitely stay there again",
            "Stayed here recently on business and had a King Loft room on one of the upper floors. Room was well appointed, clean and perfectly acceptable. Had all the amenities you could want and everything worked fine. Room was serviced daily to a high standard. I didn't notice noise coming from any of the other rooms on my floor, even though there were many other people on the floor - also, I was up high enough to not be bothered by the street noise. Sure, as another review mentioned, my room did overlook a homeless shelter, but it also overlooked many other residential buildings\\u002Fapartments and restaurants - not sure that this should be a deal breaker when selecting a hotel. Very good location for dining and plenty of options in the surrounding area and about a 30 min walk to Toronto harbour and the bottom of the downtown area. \\nOverall, highly recommended and I'd stay here again if in Toronto",
            "This hotel is in a great location for exploring downtown Toronto.  \\n\\nThe beds are comfy and the room is nice but the air con is really noisy, and this observation is based on us travelling over the last 3 months and staying in a lot of hotels.\\n\\nThe ladies at reception said that \\u201Csome people were too sensitive\\u201D and that if I turned the air con off at night that might help.  \\n\\nWhen we asked to move rooms their first question was - have you messed up your room?  Not, really customer focussed.  \\n\\nThe second rooms AC was a bit quieter but it is still a really noisy system. \\n\\nIn the second room - which was supposed to be quieter there was a letter from the manager apologising for the construction noise next door and two sets of ear plugs",
            "This hotel is fabulous.  From the moment we arrived, we were made extremely welcome.  The interior as you walk in is beautiful and it doesn't stop there.  Everything throughout the hotel is spotlessly clean and well kept.\\nThe rooms are very spacious and well appointed and there were leaflets to let you know that you could get any number of things from reception if needed.\\nWe would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Toronto, not only is it great to stay in, but really close to everything you could wish to visit whilst also being close to transport links.  Journey to and from the airport was a breez",
            "We stayed here for our final night in Toronto following a trip to Niagara Falls. We arrived late at night and received an unwelcome reception. The lobby is connected to the restaurant so no privacy or quiet to check in. The female staff was quite unfriendly. We had emailed ahead to request a high floor room but were given one on the 2nd floor. When we entered we realised it was a single king bed rather then the two twins we booked. We returned to reception to explain but the same lady insisted it was our mistake and we had booked incorrectly. When we provided email proof she passed us over to someone else with no apology. The other man was polite and sorted this issue out but we were disappointed with her attitude. The room itself was modern with stylish decor. The room was clean but the bathroom had hairs on the towels and in the sink and chewing gum stuck to the floor. The bed was very comfortable but the room was cold despite the heater and I had to sleep with a jumper on. I expected more given the price and the previous reviews and it certainly was not the high standard hotel we expected. We would not stay again",
            "Great stay in Toronto! Unique room accomidations which included vinyl records and record player in room was an awesome touch. Bed and accomidations were comfortable and the location was great. Several restaurants within a short distance",
            "Gem location in the city of Toronto.  Don\\u2019t book rooms next to the elevator rooms #12 on each floor.  Valet parking good but a little concerned that location of keys weren\\u2019t under lock and key and left unattended often.  The east side patio area has leaking natural gas smell from pipes. Waitress was aware of it and didn\\u2019t think it was an issue because it always smells.  We moved seats.",
            "The Anndore is in a perfect location for accessing all Toronto's amenities. It's nice to leave the very busy Toronto streets and be enveloped in calm and quiet. The beds were comfortable, the room was clean, bathroom great, and we really appreciated the separate seating area. We also appreciated being able to store our bags. I was eating alone and found the staff in the restaurant very sensitive to making me feel comfortable, as it's not always easy to be by yourself. I would happily stay at Anndore again",
            "I recently stayed at the Anndore House with my partner. We absolutely loved our stay. The location is great, right off Yonge Street and close to Yorkville. The room felt personalized and had cute touches. The shower was gorgeous and the bed was comfortable. The rooms have AC units which is nice in the summer. I felt safe staying there because they lock the front doors at night but customers have access with their key cards. Check in and check out were efficient, even with our checkout at four o'clock in the morning. I would absolutely stay here again",
            "We were going to Toronto from UK for a baby shower and also wanted to experience downtown. I booked The Anndore because I wanted to stay with my daughters in the same room, \\u201Cbonding, chat time\\u201D \\u2026 it was amazing , beautifully clean , they delivered bath robes daily when we called housekeeping, without even asking there was a knock at the door which I opened to a lovely young man delivering extra towels. The room has lovely touches like a record player and a choice of 4 albums, we played Harry Belafonte whilst having a drink in the lounge area. Lovely Pluck sleep tea bags were on the tray for a bedtime drink and we are now obsessed with them . Location was phenomenal, Yorkville has really upmarket shops  and restaurants and felt very safe to walk around \\u2026\\nAll round wonderful stay !",
            "Such a great location, one of my favourite places to stay in TO. Amazing access to subway too! The area is busy though and the outside noise can be a bit much for some. This last trip, the fire alarm across the street went off for an hour in the middle of the night. The walls could be a little thicker but they do provide ear plugs! The biggest issue that really is just odd, is the entrance, you would never know it\\u2019s there and it\\u2019s a bit sketchy at first, but very cool once you get inside and the real experience is there.",
            "Nice boutique property in Toronto. Overall nice rooms and great location.  Weird that in house restaurant is not part of hotel so therefore no Hyatt Globalist benefit of free breakfast and 500 in lieu of free breakfast never deposited into my account. Had a little excitement when I was there and homeless encampment next door caught on fire. 15 minutes all fires were extinguished and next morning all debris was efficiently removed.\\n\\nMain issue for me is the lack of pillow choice. Should have choice besides high thick foam pillows!!! Was tough to sleep on",
            "This place is amazing! The style of rooms, the helpful professional staff at check in make this a overall great experience.  Great well lit Public Parking right across the Street. Secure entrance makes you feel safe and in a very nice area of Toronto a minute walk to Bloor St. I keep rebooking and will continue to",
            "I had to take a few nights at a hotel in my own city due to an Emergency and was very surprised at how great this hotel is. \\nPros: The service is really above and beyond. Ask for anything and they will provide. The rooms are bigger than expected though the decor is unusual. No carpeted floors in the rooms which I love. Detachable shower heads were a plus. Two single seater couches in front of the TV for a King bed room in a hotel in downtown Toronto for about 300 a night? Wow.\\nCons: Very noisy. No soundproofing and other guests were loud on my floor. And the construction noise really vibrates throughout the room and you FEEL it. The AC is on the louder side so be ware though I didn't mind since I'm used to a loud AC. I didn't sleep the first night due to the noise outside the window. But oh well. I still gave it a 5 star because of how great the staff was. Really made me feel better at a time when I wasn't feeling great.\\",
            "The Anndore House is a short couple of blocks from the landmark intersection of Yonge and Bloor Streets, and was previously the shabby Comfort Hotel. Hyatt took over the building, hired a decorator who thinks dark brown with black accents is a cheerful colour scheme for hotel rooms, and installed a restaurant and bar in most of the ground floor space. They also doubled the room rates, which still leaves them lower than other midtown hotels. The Anndore seemed clean, staff were helpful when I needed a couple of small things, and somehow, amazingly, the Comfort Hotel room doors that used to close with a jarring crash have been softened somewhat. However, practically everything in the room seemed badly arranged (awkward bathroom, tiny strange light switches, duvet suitable only for short people) and the bar didn\\u2019t seem to be open any time I wanted to make use of it. Your experience may be better, as long as you have the arm strength to open the huge heavy entrance doors. Also, watch out for the little slope in the floor right in front of the elevator",
            "Very nice boutique Hotel in Downtown Toronto with an industrial design. Staff were very friendly and engaging. All request for items like ice and extra glasses were delivered in a timely manner. Front desk staff and doorman were very nice and helpful",
            "Excellent experience. \\nThe room is clean with a very trendy decor. \\nThe hotel is ideally located (Bloor-Yonge subway station 2 minutes walking or Green P parking on the other side of the street)\\nStaff is providing an excellent service. \\n\\",
            "I was a bit hesitant about booking The Anndore House, knowing it was once a Comfort Inn \\u2013 a brand and physical older building I wouldn't typically choose. But after reading the reviews and seeing the photos of what Hyatt has done, I decided to give it a shot, and I\\u2019m so glad I did! From the moment I arrived, everything was fantastic. The hotel has a fun vibe\\u2014small, cozy, and boutique without feeling cramped. Check-in was a breeze, and I was pleasantly surprised by the size of my room. It was unexpectedly large, beautifully designed, and incredibly clean\\u2014honestly, one of the cleanest hotel rooms I\\u2019ve stayed in. Everything worked perfectly, and the bed was extremely comfortable.\\n\\nThe location, while a little further north than I needed, was just a quick subway ride away from the main spots. Even as a first-time visitor to Toronto, the TTC was easy to navigate, with the nearest station just a short walk away. The street itself has a few questionable spots, but it\\u2019s clear that the area is evolving, with newer restaurants and stores popping up.\\n\\nI enjoyed the restaurant and its overall vibe, as I ate there for breakfast each morning. The people were great, and breakfast was good, but I had a couple of very minor issues. The buffet selection, while good, was a bit limited. Additionally, the weekend breakfast hours were a bit odd\\u2014brunch started later, so I had to miss the sit-down breakfast altogether as I was heading to the airport. Fortunately, the quick cafe staff were super accommodating and made me a fresh menu item, but I do feel that a consistent breakfast schedule throughout the week would make more sense.\\n\\nAll in all, I couldn\\u2019t have asked for a better stay. I highly recommend The Anndore House and would absolutely stay here again",
            "The hotel is a nice, botique hotel and the staff were very friendly and open to any questions that were asked.  From food recommendations to things to see or do, the staff were very knowledgeable and made the trip a pleasure.  The hotel itself is north of the lake but well within a Uber\\u002FLyft ride (in winter, walkable in the warmer season) to various destinations down by the lake.   I was pleasently surprised and will definitely stay at this location again the next time I visit Toronto.",
            "I travel to this city quite often and have been in search of a hotel with a convenient location.  On my recent visit I did just that when I happened upon this stylish and trendy looking boutique hotel.  The hotel was within walking distance to everything I needed and everyone I was there to visit.  Very close to subways, restaurants, parking, Yorkville shopping and groceries\\u002Fcafes.  The rooms are very spacious and offer some unique touches not normally found at other hotels.  It is nestled within a neighborhood off the main streets so you feel like you are in a home away from home.  From the walkup to the entry, the Anndore house is very esthetically pleasing. The staff are very attentive and friendly. This just may be my new \\\"go to\\\" for my frequent visits to this city in the future. I am looking forward to experiencing the hotels amenities (restaurants etc.) once the COVID restrictions are lifted.\\",
            "Tucked away a block from Yonge\\u002FBloor is a boutique hotel that has surprises at every turn. The online photos are very reflective of what you get, both from the rooms and the rest of the hotel. Very impressed by internal security and safe vibe. The bed was super-comfy and the shampoo\\u002Fconditioner\\u002Fbody wash smelled great. Oh, and as a bonus, you could turn the bathroom light on from your bedside, and turn on\\u002Foff all the individual lights in the room from your bedside",
            "Stayed at the Anndore as Toronto entered stage 3 of COVID-19 restriction-easing. There were no amenities, but the design of the hotel definitely made up for any missing features. Small touches like the early 20th century telephones and brass bathroom and shower taps made our stay very memorable. And the Constantine restaurant upper patio was perfect, with the tree branches and hanging lights creating a cozy ambiance",
            "We loved our stay at The Anndore House.  The staff were very friendly and went out of their way to help us check in early and were also able to store luggage on the day of departure. The hotel and rooms were spotless. We loved our room, with 2 queen beds and a seating area. The room also had a fridge which we were able to use. I know it maybe it doesn't go with the look but maybe the room would benefit from curtains, as the white slatted blinds do let a lot of light in when it's daylight outside. The hotel was surprisingly quiet for the location. \\n\\nOne thing I will say is the neighbourhood is questionable. The hotel is located right next to a subway station which is great for getting to Downtown Toronto, however I would not walk around the area of the hotel at night,  especially not alone. We noticed a large number of drug users (openly taking drugs in the surrounding streets), and we went to a play park a  5 minute walk from the hotel where a large number of people were openly taking A Class substances. I would not let this put me off staying at the hotel again, but I guess as with every major city across the world it's important to keep your wits about you, keep valuables close etc. \\n\\nOverall a great stay and I would definitely stay at the hotel again",
            "The location is fantastic, with loads of food options in the area, and a short walk from both the TTC and Yorkville. Public parking right across the street at a decent rate was also appreciated. The staff were helpful, and the rooms were clean and comfortable. The cocktails at the Constantine Restaurant on the first floor were great as well, I'd definitely be back",
            "Recently completed a three-night stay at this hotel, and was extremely pleased with the customer service we received as well as the condition of our rooms. There was a bit of a mix-up during our check-in process, in that we had booked a room with two beds, and had been assigned a King room. Staff sorted this out for us very quickly, and we were able to check in after a very long day of travel. The rooms were beautiful, and parking was available directly across the street. The location was very close to two different Subway stations. I has read that the hotel could be noisy, and we had brought a fan to mitigate this, but it was not necessary. Will definitely stay here again when we are next in toronto",
            "Location is ideal for touring Toronto. Clean, unique, pleasant decor in our room.  We slept very well in the comfy bed and as far as the windows go, if you open the wooden shutters there are blackout roll down blinds.  Very modern conveniences in the room.    Staff are friendly. Get a Citypass. Visit Casa Loma. Take the subway. Only one block away.   This hotel was a great decision for us!   And the dining room is divine. Constantine's is an amazing experience.  Three nights stay on the top floor of an exceptional boutique hotel. You will not be disappointed.  Thank for helping my daughter and I make memories.",
            "I have stayed in various hotels in Toronto and Anndore has by far the nicest room. The decor is retro + industrial and is exactly like shown on their website (less the flowers).\\nThe staff is friendly and helpful. Special shout out to Augusto at the front desk for the nice warm welcome and helpfulness. It really gave a first awesome impression of the hotel. Room cleaning staff is also very helpful and responsive for missing items from the room.\\nInside the room, spacious walkin closet and sitting area with style. Lots of well-organized cupboards and shelf space throughout the room you can move your own whole bedroom in here.\\nSome people commented on the safety outside of the hotel. It's downtown in a big city and what more needs to be said?\\nAs for other people complaining about the thin walls and noise from other rooms. I also did not find any problem. Yes you can hear some noise from the hallway but it's not different than what I have experienced in other hotels.\\nThere is no gym or swimming pool but I knew it before I booked.\\",
            "This hotel is truly a hidden gem in the middle of bustling downtown Toronto. The rooms are beautifully decorated with thoughtful details, and it was surprisingly family friendly (travelled with a 2.5 year old and she loved it!) Central location close to all the major transit lines, but the hotel itself felt like a cozy oasis away from the buzz of the city. I'd stay here 100 times over",
            "We spent over 3 weeks here in December and early January . The location is excellent , less than a 100 metre from the crossing of Yonge and Bloor There is an excellent restaurant ( Constantine ) and bar in the hotel . The Crow\\u2019s Nest cafe always has really friendly staff and great coffee .\\nIt is excellent for a long term stay even in terms of the layout . You can back and forth to your rooms from the outside without having to cross reception ensuring a greater degree of privacy. \\nThe rooms are fun - I was on the 9 th floor and had a pretty decent view of the downtown buildings. They have quirky things like a record player which is also a blue tooth speaker. \\nThe key factor behind an enjoyable 3 weeks was the staff. Every interaction whether at reception, the bar , the restaurant or the cafe was very friendly and made us feel comfortable and  welcome",
            "Stayed in a King Loft Room. The style of the hotel is really nice - sort of quirky\\u002Findustrial with lots of nice touches in the room including the record player. The room is a pretty good size (used the space well), the 2 armchairs and table were a nice bonus and and bed was big and comfortable. The staff were helpful and friendly and the bar area is really nice. \\n\\nThe main let down was the location in terms of it being noisy and a little on the rough side. Its near a main road (Yonge Street) and the windows don't offer much sound proofing. We were also next to the lift which made it noisy. Its also a bit of a walk from the main parts of Toronto. \\n\\nSo overall it was good but think where your room is located is important and important to consider where you want to be near. Our room was on a high floor which was great but west facing which had a city view but also made it noisy",
            "A chic boutique hotel located in downtown Toronto.  The room got this retro feeling to it. love the little details and how they spend the time to decorate the room with a vinyl player but sadly, the vinyl records are all scratched up so you can't really enjoy it.  Overall a decent stay while parking across the street is abit pricey",
            "You cant fault the location, and this is why we chose this hotel.  It is in the heart of Toronto, we easy access to shops, cafes and restaurant.  Vibrant, safe area, walking distance from many attractions.\\nThe hotel itself is very nice.  Feels new, definitely modern with a great dining space and bar.  Room had a few issues, maybe it was new that s why?  The room key didnt always work in the lift, or the door.  The light switch frame fell off the wall.  Minor things that take away from the experience though. Service was overall good, reception staff, tentative, most of the times and willing to help.  Customer service style a bit haphazard, or just quite different from what you traditionally anticipate as customer service in a hotel...  For these reasons I think that value for money was not quote there, even though you basically have to pay for being in the center of Toront",
            "I was hesitant about booking this hotel because I knew so little about it, but the stay was really nice (except for the crappy Satellite TV service during the height of the closing days of the Olympics!!!).  The rooms hve false brick walls with cool artwork, a fake rotary phone and an old-school vinyl record player!  That was a lot of fun to play with and took me back to my childhood.  The hotel is in the Yorkville neighborhood which is near Downtown Toronto as well as a homeless shelter (two doors down to the right -- so go left!).  It's also near a Tim Horton's and two strip clubs, so something for every member of the family!  I never felt unsafe there -- they lock the doors after 10pm, so the strippers don't get in- so don't forget your card key.  If you book on points, choose the valet service -- it's free.  Just give a tip.  Overall, a nice stay and I would reconsider if they FIX THE SATELLITE TV!!!",
            "My recent stay at The Anndore House in Toronto was a perfect blend of contemporary chic and urban comfort. The hotel\\u2019s location in the trendy Yorkville neighborhood provided a stylish retreat while being within walking distance of Toronto\\u2019s cultural attractions. My room was a haven of modern elegance, with sleek design and all the amenities I needed. The central location allowed me to explore Toronto\\u2019s vibrant neighborhoods, from Yorkville to Kensington Market. Dining at the hotel\\u2019s restaurant, Constantine, was a culinary adventure, with a menu that celebrated global flavors and creative dishes. The Anndore House exceeded all my expectations, and I eagerly look forward to my next visit to this stylish gem in Toronto",
            "Stayed at Anndore House for five days and must say that I'm really satisfied with the hotel and its location midtown Toronto. Close to the vibrant Yonge Street and easy to reach subway or also walking downtown. With to mentioned its close location to the nice area Yorkville. The rooms are relatively large and modern with an industrial design touch, of course this is personal but I liked it",
            "Nothing beats coming back to a comfortable bed and relaxing in a space that is more like a city studio apartment (fridge no microwave) than a boring hotel room.  Wished that in-house restaurant Constantine had been open for dinner  during our stay, but finding dining options nearby was never a problem.   Lots of food options to fit most everyone\\u2019s taste and budget within walking distance along Bloor and Yonge.  Just watch your step along Yonge street, Toronto is not immune to the urban homeless problems that plague other cities like SF and NYC. Front desk and housekeeping staff were friendly and great at what they do. Public parking across the street from Anndore was convenient and taking the TTC at Bloor\\u002FYonge station was a breeze because it was so close to the hotel.  Overall, great place to stay",
            "This hotel is located only a few minutes walk from the intersection of Toronto\\u2019s two main subway lines. There are lots of amenities in the area even if the local streetscape is a bit sketchy. The room was roomy and very tastefully decorated with a very urban feel. Lots of closet room. Large bathroom with fantastic waterfall shower. Building is quiet. The food area downstairs is really well appointed although I don\\u2019t get a chance to eat there during my stay. Staff were very pleasant and efficient.",
            "Many hotels in downtown Toronto resemble each other.  I was looking for a funkier place.  I certainly got that at the Anndore House.  Staff was welcoming.  Bar area is comfortable and one can also have access to full restaurant menu there.  Menu was lovely as were the drinks choices.  Room are fun to look at and practical as well.  Decoration and style is interesting.  Well situated also"

            "I was a bit apprehensive at first, after reading some of the reviews; however, I was pleasantly surprised once I arrived at the hotel. We arrived early in the morning, although check in is only at 3, the staff made arrangements for our room to be ready for us to be able to rest. During our wait they offered a complimentary continental breakfast, took our baggages, so we could eat, sit and relax while we waited. Within a half hour our room was ready. Now that's service !!\\n\\nThe rooms were very nicely decorated, very clean, a bit on the small side but I really didn't mind, you have plenty of room to move around. The bed was comfortable, the rooms were quiet, we had two great nights of rest.\\n\\nThe complimentary continental breakfast had a good variety, cereal, muffins, toasts, croissants, cookies, fruits... everything fresh and delicious.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly, greated us everytime we came by the lobby. They were helpfull answering all our questions about the city and what to visit.\\n\\nWe will definitely be staying at the Hotel Victoria again on our next visit to Toronto.\\",
            "The room (2 queen beds) was very comfortable. The location was fantastic. The service was friendly. The price was among the best I could find downtown.\\n\\nThe only issue was that I never received an email confirming my booking. When I called about this, the lady confirmed my booking verbally and said she would try to send the confirmation by email. Another guest I spoke to had the same situation. Oddly, I received an email after my stay asking for feedback about the stay.\\n\\nA couple small things to note. The elevator is very slow, just be patient. And there was no fridge in our room, which was unfortunate as we had leftovers from dinner to keep refrigerated.\\n\\nAll in all, I would definitely stay there again when visiting downtown Toronto",
            "My first experience with this hotel was when my boyfriend and I arrived in Toronto and missed the turn for the parking lot. We got very lost because of all the one-ways and could not figure out how to get back. I called the hotel for help and the woman was quite rude. Saying things like \\\"That's what I just said\\\" and \\\"That's what I'm trying to telling you\\\", etc (I took down her name but I accidentally deleted it). When we finally got parked (which was a NIGHTMARE) and got to the hotel, we checked in. We stayed for four days, three nights, and the staff never once said hello to us as we were coming in or going out. That is not \\\"superior customer service\\\" (as is said on their website). The room that we had, which was a standard queen was very small, however since it is a boutique hotel it was what I was expecting. The room was fine but there were markings all over the walls in the bedroom and bathroom. There were pieces of wood missing from the walls and the wallpaper was peeling. There were also black stains on the sheets and a mark on the head board. On the website it says that the bathrooms and guestrooms are newly renovated but if that is true then either they don't take good care\\u002F clean properly or they just didn't do a good job. The sink was old and cracking and there were tiles missing in the shower (the website makes it sound like the bathrooms are large but the shower was TINY, I could barely fit in it. When I dropped my razor it was almost impossible for me to pick it up. I feel that I must add that I am 5' 7\\\" and 120 pounds so I am not a big person.) Also the toilet was wobbly. The website says that the hotel (guestrooms and bathrooms) are newly renovated but it appears that only the lobby was. On the Saturday that we were there it was raining and so we asked the man at the front desk if he had an umbrella that we could borrow. He looked at us suspiciously and asked us what our room number was. When we told him, he gave us an umbrella and said \\\"make sure you bring that back\\\". When we went outside and opened the umbrella it was broken and wouldn't stay up. With all that being said, the hotel was in a great part of town and we enjoyed being close to many things",
            "We booked a four night stay at Hotel Victoria in Toronto for a holiday vacation (December, 2013).  We were convinced by the internet pictures and descriptions of the hotel as a charming place to stay, and by the description in Fodor's 2012 guide to Toronto and Niagara Falls.  Our bottom line: the experience was so awful that we spent a good part of the first evening in the hotel finding another place to stay and checked out the following morning.  There were so many things to dislike: the room we stayed in was tiny and claustrophobic.  The bathroom was so small you essentially were in danger of tripping over the toilet upon entering the bathroom.  The heating system was absolutely terrible: the vent poured out heat at an extremely high temperature, and there was no way to modify it.  When we turned the heat off, we were freezing.  We spent the night with the heat on as low as possible and the window open, and got up continually throughout the night to adjust the heat and modify the degree to which the window was open.  There was no good solution to this problem:  we were alternately hot and sweating or freezing cold.  Fodor's indicated that a \\\"pro\\\" of the hotel was \\\"gym privileges at nearby health club.\\\"  This is absolutely misleading.  First, there was a hefty fee to use the \\\"nearby\\\" club; and in addition, it was several blocks from the hotel, which is not appealing when having to make a trip back after a work out.  Another problem was location: there was not much around at night, so options for meals were limited.  The only positive thing we can say about this hotel is that staff were gracious in allowing us to leave without penalty.  \\n\\nOne final comment: for people who still use print travel guides: my experience over years is that Frommer's is consistently reliable, Fodor's is not.  The only reason we used Fodor's guide is that we could not find a Frommer's that was as recent as Fodor's.  I will never pay for a Fodor's guide again",
            "Abbiamo preso una stanza businnes, interni piuttosto nuovi e dotata di tutto il necessario, anche il bagno sufficentemente grande e nuovo.\\nAssenza di pargheggio dell'hotel, pertanto essendo in centro \\u00E8 un impresa trovarlo a un prezzo decente, giusto nei weekend si paga poco in quello del centro commerciale sottostante, comuqnue i bagagli dovete scarrozzarveli in giro.\\nPosizione centralissima in una delle arterie principale che taglia Toronto, a 2 passi da tutto veramente comodo",
            "We stayed at this hotel in November of 2005.  The Hotel was still under renovations, and the rooms are small, but if you are used to staying in European hotels this one will seem large.  It was clean and the hotel staff was helpfull and gave us loads of directions and shortcuts around town.  The location if fabulous, blocks from BCE place, The waterfront, Eaton Centre and the subway.  It's half a block from Marche that is an open market concept restaurant that is delicious and will satisfy everyone.\\n\\nWe are going back in June.\\",
            "We were very happy with Hotel Victoria.  The location is close to so much and easy to find.   There is a fantastic restaurant across the street (Irish Emassy pub) and the hotel has a great breakfast restaurant attached...not cheap but excellent food.  Our room was very small but nice and the most comfortable bed i have ever slept in.  Our friends had a king room so they had a bench and a couple of chairs so thats where we visited.  The staff were lovely.  We felt the value was great and will stay here again.  Parking is expensive and awkward but that's Toronto.  All in all we were very happy with our choice",
            "My wife and I enjoyed our stay at the Hotel Victoria.\\n\\nPros\\n1. Hotel is clean and well maintained.\\n2. Staff were polite enough - they could be warmer and friendlier but nonetheless acceptable and par for the course in a big city.\\n3. Compares favorably against other establishments of similar rating and room rates in both USA and Canada. \\n4. Room is well-decorated, spacious and extremely comfortable with clean and new linen and towels, cable TV, iron and ironing board, coffee maker and free WiFi internet (which works!)\\n5. Conveniently located to shopping, restaurants and, for those keen on walking, within walking distance of the business district and many tourist attractions including the Hockey Hall of Fame, the Waterfront, Air Canada Centre (Toronto Maple Leafs), Roundhouse Park, CN Tower, Rogers Centre, Wayne Gretzky's, Roy Thomson Hall, Canada's Walk of Fame, Eaton Centre, etc.\\n6. Hockey Hall of Fame is only a 2 minute walk away.\\n7. OverEasy, the onsite restaurant, serves fantastic food for breakfast and lunch, at reasonable prices.\\n8. Great Burger Kitchen is a 5 minute walk away at 9 Church St. Possibly the cheapest food within walking distance of the hotel, yet the burgers were fantastic! Especially important as most restaurants in the immediate area are costly.\\n\\nCons\\n1. No on-site car parking. Note that there is a City of Toronto (Green P) municipal parking facility nearby at 2 Church St. It is a covered and secured parking station for about $14 per day. While the carpark is nearby, it was slightly inclined uphill and very inconvenient with large luggage bags.\\n2. On-site restaurant, OverEasy, is not open for dinner (wish it was!)\\n\\nSummary\\nI have no hesitation in recommending this hotel, particularly at the discounted room rate I was lucky enough to secure, plus the convenience of location to the primary attractions we wanted to visit eg HHOF. Would we stay again? Yes definitely.\\n\\nI am giving the Hotel Victoria 4 Stars, not as any suggestion of hotel star-classification, but as a reflection of our satisfaction with the establishment. A thumbs up!\\n\\nA humungous thanks should you rate this review as helpful. Happy travels",
            "A couple of years ago, I stayed here for the first time for one or two nights. It was by far the best-value mid-range accomodation I've stayed in in Toronto, because it's downtown, close to the train station and comfortable. I've travelled the world and have stayed in a wide range of accomodations, and the room where I stayed in the Hotel Victoria stands out in my memory for its cushy bed and nice bathroom.  Other places I've stayed in the city were overpriced and far-flung, or merely far-flung and cheap but not worth it. \\n\\nSince I'll be travelling by rail between Montreal and Windsor, I've decided to give the Hotel Victoria another go.\\",
            "Not only are the rooms extremely small and amenities scarce, the beds are quite uncomfortable and they charge you $125 deposit upon check in, then when you check out they make you wait until a maid has gone to inspect your room and then you are permitted to receive a refund for your deposit and check out. I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF THIS HAPPENING IN A DOWNTOWN TORONTO HOTEL IN MY LIFE!!! It just so happened that the card I was charged the deposit on was actually stolen and frauded the night prior to checkout and the hotel REFUSED to refund my money and said I would need to call the manager who would be in Tuesday. It was Sunday morning when this was taking place (what kind of hotel doesn't have a manger on duty on a weekend? it's their busiest time!) They wouldn't refund my deposit on any of my credit cards or other debit card, it HAD to be the EXACT debit card I paid the deposit on (the account which was frauded and now inactive). This place is not worth saving a few dollars for the hassle you put up with and the hotel itself isn't even nice. I would much rather stay somewhere that treats their guests as valued customers",

            "We read good reviews on this website and thought the location was convenient since it's a few blocks from the train station. Upon seeing the front of the building, we were worried. It  looked run down, and upon entering the lobby looked even worse. Pipes with insulation hanging off them came out of the ceiling, and everything needed a coat of paint. We got the key to our room and went up in the elevator. The room wasn't completely uninhabitable, but for $130 a night I was expecting something better than a flophouse. \\n\\nMost of the furnishings looked ancient, the rug was obviously old and not clean, and the room was an odd shape and also very dark. The only window looked into a brick air shaft. \\n\\nWe went to the desk to complain, and they explained that there weren't that many other rooms in our price range. We got the keys to a more recently renovated room on the 2nd floor, but it wasn't much better. The light-colored rug was almost black in front of the door and the room was tiny. The window was about 5 feet about the floor with a through-the-wall air conditioner below it. \\n\\nWe checked out and found a room at the Day's Inn Hotel next to the old Maple Leaf Gardens. It was quite a bit cheaper and MUCH nicer. It even had a view. Don't stay at the Hotel Victoria, you will regret it. There are much better bargains around Toronto if you look",
            "I usually book my hotel reservations on line. I choose the location then read some of the reviews and look at the pictures of the rooms and facilities. This is one of those few times that when I entered the room, it looked exactly like the picture on line.Of course I was very pleased. I loved that they had wooden floors and had those sofas at the foot of the bed. The room was clean and fresh. i reserved for a queen room with two queen beds like I usually do but the space in this room was much larger than the past ones I have been to.\\nNo restaurant in the hotel, but I did not mind because it was at the center of downtown Toronto and we planned to dine out. I would highly recommend this place. Slept like a baby and very satisfied customer",
            "Weekend trip for a show at the Royal Alexandra Theater. We love this location, tons of restaurants within walking distance. Eaton Centre area about 10 min walk. Walk to theater also 10 min. Easy check in with a delightful staff member. Rooms and bathrooms are tiny as with all hotels of this type, but when you're not there much who cares? We were also three adults so could manage sharing one small bathroom (full length mirror outside the bathroom helped). Mini fridge was an unexpected perk; due to small hotel, no ice on every level, have to go to basement - easy or someone from front desk will bring to you. We blew a fuse with hairdryer; a maintenance person came up within five minutes and problem solved. Sadly we forgot a pair of shoes in the closet; happily, hotel kindly accommodated and sent the shoes to us for $25. Love that service! There is no parking specifically at this hotel but there is a structure just around the block on Wellington St (Indigo Pkg Garage), for $30 (American) per night, AND lots of spaces for charging electric vehicles, a pleasant surprise. Would highly recommend this lovely place",

            "The staff here were all attentive and sincere in their services. I loved the sense of history and the blend of old and new in the interiors. The room of course was smaller than new hotels but very functional. I mentioned to staff the lighting could be a bit brighter. The location in Old Toronto is excellent being a few steps from King Subway station",
            "Arrived tired after a long flight from England to find that our room had been cancelled and sold to some one else. They had informed me, I later found, by e-mail whilst I was on the plane. We were then given a small room with a double bed that I had to share with my sister before moving to our booked room the next day. We subsequently found out that there were 2 conferences on in Toronto that day so all hotels were full. The staff did not care, were not apologetic, never smiled the whole time we were there. We were offered a free buffet breakfast as compensation - wow!!!\\nApart from that the beds are very comfortable and the hotel is in a good location in Downtown Toronto. Would not bother to eat in 'Over Easy', the Marche just a minute down the street is much better, cheaper and has a huge choice.\\nThe staff in this hotel need to definitely go on a customer service course as they have a 'do not care, not my problem attitude' - not a good advert for visitors to Toronto",
            "Having stayed in a dozen Toronto hotels on business over the years, this one was certainly the worst. I was charged $500 for an extremely modest room - tiny, outdated and uncomfortable bed, glitchy TV and a small window overlooking a brick wall. The room was inadequate, but the real problem is the price point - I was charged $500 which is obscene. When I asked if there may have been a price error, I was told that it included free water (!) and bath gowns.\\nThe hotel advertises itself as a \\\"boutique hotel\\\" which is very misleading - it has none of the charm, services, amenities or quality one would associate with that category. The hotel has no lobby or restaurant",
            "Great location, close to everything in Toronto, a short walk from Union station. A quiet boutique hotel with very patient and helpfull staff, great for us as we just got off a transatlantic flight. Clean all over with everything you need. Good breakfast with a good selection of food to chose from. \\nA bit small rooms, but still we wanted for nothing",
            "H\\u00F4tel bien situ\\u00E9 pour visiter Toronto car il est pas tr\\u00E8s loin de la CN Towers. Petite astuce si vous voulez \\u00E0 CN Towers passer par la gare vous irez plus vite.

            "Unobtrusively tucked away on Yonge Street,  the historic Victoria is what I would consider to be a little gem.  We spent only one night here while in town for a concert, but we would definitely come back again! Our party occupied two Deluxe Twin rooms - one on the seventh floor, and one on the 2nd floor. The one on the 7th floor was definitely the better of the two (much larger, and with a better view), but both rooms were clean (the bathrooms scrupulously so), and the atmosphere was an oasis of quiet in the middle of the hustle and bustle of a big city. In the case of the Victoria, \\\"old\\\" does not mean run-down -- indeed, it was much better maintained than many slick new establishments. While lacking in some of the amenities ~ such as a heated pool, a workout center, an in-house restaurant, and room service ~ that some people might consider necessities, we found the Victoria to be charming.  The Victoria is an excellent choice at a very attractive price point. It was within reasonable walking distance from parking and many downtown attractions. The continental breakfast was light, but ample; the staff congenial and helpful",
            "Will definitely come back and stay again! Located in Toronto's city center, subway station is in 2 mins away. Although this is a over 100 years historical hotel, but you can merely find it old. The water pressure is great, no pipe noise and with decent room rate. Recommend to young travelers who want to explore this charming city in a convenient way",
            "I discovered this hotel through Tripadvisor. I was looking for a place that was reasonably priced, given the fact that it was downtown, and a place that was conveniently located. Thankfully, this hotel delivered both and we stayed 3 nights. This place is excellent!!! Note: my review is for their DELUXE room.\\n\\nThe Good:\\n\\n1) Rooms are clean, new, and modern. Incidentally, I'm pretty sure the paint in some of the hallways was only a few days old. Our deluxe room came equipped with all the standard stuff but it also had a mini-fridge and, surprisingly, free all-you-can-watch Apple TV. While I didn't watch a lot of it, I did watch some and it was great. The place has a boutique feel.\\n\\n2) Location is Yonge St. This place is a 5-minute walk to Union Station, the Hockey Hall of fame is about a block down, there's a 24-hour grocery store that's accessible with a short walk, it's about 10 minutes walk to the Harbourfront, etc. The short of it: location is top-notch; you can walk everywhere. There's a Subway literally next door, along with a restaurant in the hotel, and Starbucks and Shoppers Drugmart are a block away.\\n\\n3) Staff. They were professional, helpful. Any problems we had were quickly taken care of. Even the cleaning staff were keen to help out when we had issues with our TV.\\n\\n4) Free Wi-Fi. Needless to say, many of the so-called top-tier hotels still charge for this in 2012. Hotel Victoria's was consistent and quick and hassle-free.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\n1) While the rooms were new and clean, the hotel clearly had some issues with its building contractors. The room flooring must have been installed hastily because it creaked pretty much everywhere you walked on it. While the bathroom was also clean and new, the tub was already pulling away from some of the sealant between it and the tiles. These were just minor, incidental things, but they were noticeable.\\n\\n2) The curtains didn't fully darken our room. The light from outside kept the room brighter than it should have been at night",
            "This boutique hotel was very nice. Everything was super clean. The room was a little small but fine for us since we were only staying one night. We were able to check in a little early which was nice. There is no parking but they directed us to a municipal lot a couple blocks away. We parked there overnight and paid about $38CAD when we left the next day, which from my understanding is pretty decent for downtown Toronto. It was nice to be right in the city and be in walking distance to a lot of things. Overall a great value, I would definitely stay here again.",
            "I was more than pleasantly surprised by this hotel. I arrived late and was welcomed quickly and warmly by the desk staff. It took minutes to check me in, and I was in my room. The hotel must have been renovated because for such an old historic hotel, it was very modern and comfortable. I could hear some street noise outside, but I couldn't hear a peep from surrounding rooms in any direction.\\n\\nThe bed was very VERY comfortable - I slept like a baby in it. Highly recommend it for the beds alone!\\n\\nAnd I have to comment on the cleanliness... because I was trying to squeeze lotion out of their provided little bottle in the bathroom when the bottle exploded on me... But what impressed me as I wiped up the lotion from the hardwood floor was those tissues did not have a speck of dust or dirt on them - this was one super clean room! Can't be sure it would pass one of those tests they do on the shock shows, but I can't think of many places in a Toronto winter with floors that clean!\\n\\nThe hotel is located on the Eastern edge of the \\\"PATH\\\", Toronto's underground city. You still had to step outside to access the PATH, but it was literally next door so not too bad given how extremely cold it was when I was there. The hotel is close to Union Station and the business district (all accessible by the PATH - but ask for a map otherwise you'll get lost!). \\n\\nIt wasn't very close to any stops made by the airport express bus - the nearest stops were about 10 minutes walk away (I imagine the Union Station bus stop was once upon a time close - until they began whatever is causing the monster construction there that has shut down the streets in that area for a few years now and the bus has to detour to quite a ways away...",
            "Foi a segunda vez que ficamos no hotel. Est\\u00E1 melhor ainda. O quarto parecia ter sido renovado. Bom atendimento. Muito bem localizado. Ao lado de esta\\u00E7\\u00E3o de metro King, do restaurante March\\u00E8, pr\\u00F3ximo da Union Station, a uma dist\\u00E2ncia caminh\\u00E1vel de lojas e do shopping center Toronto Eaton Centre.

            "To be honest with you, I was little bit worried before staying at the hotel after the reviews we had read on the site. This was our final stop on our 4wk trip around Canada where we had stayed in delightful b and bs and small inns. I even went as far as checking the web for any last minute deals at another hotel.\\nWe were very surprised by the accomodating and friendly staff at the front desk who provided maps and organised our tour to Niagara. When we checked in, they even notified us that the rate quoted in our email had been reduced because of specials they were offering. We were surprised that our room was modern, clean and comfortable. There was plenty of room (we stayed in a deluxe room with queen bed).\\nFor breakfast, they served warm muffins, croissants, bread, and cereal. Not bad for a meal that is included in the rate. The breakfast room was a bit dark, and small. The lobby, and lift could do with a bit of a face lift, but the most important was our room.\\nThe hotel is a few minutes walk to Eaton Centre, Air Canada Centre, and CN Tower. The subway is only a few steps away. Excellent location.\\",
            "The location in Old Toronto is great. Within walking distance to the water.\\nThe hotel itself appeared nice online but was very different on arrival. \\nNo shuttle to or from the airport. The shower in the room had a large gap in the wall that was unfinished with tile or grout. Seemed like a good place to grow mold. \\nRequested a different room and was moved to another floor with a room that had a broken air conditioner.  Moved again to a 3rd room. The rooms were very small. The room had no full length mirror. The towel rack fell off of the wall when I picked up the towel. There is only 1 ice machine in the entire building and it is in the basement of the hotel.\\nThe staff was very friendly and tried to be accommodating, but this place is kind of a wreck.  \\nI will be back to Toronto, but will find better options in the future",
            "Stayed a few nights and it\\u2019s location is great absolutely amazing! Walked to scotiabank arena for ice hockey game, CN Tower, Ripleys Underwater World, St Lawrence Markets etc. Great cafe just down to he street. Room compact but big enough! Very clean! And for you Pokemon or Wizards Unite fans my avatar flitted between 3 Pokestops and a couple of inns",
            "I thought it would be worth it to stay really close to the main attractions in Toronto, but next time I'll pay the cab fare and stay somewhere else.  The room hardly had any standing space after I put my two pieces of luggage down.  The washroom had no amenities, neither did the room (there was no space for amenities anyway).  There was absolutely NO VIEW, and the staff basically ignored us since we were young.\\",
            "We spent two nights at the Hotel Victoria aug 5-6. We had a queen room and like previous posters have said the room was very small. The location was great as the Wife being a shop-Alcoholic had a short walk to the Eaton Center and I being a avid baseball fan had less than a fifeteen minute walk to the Rogers Center. Lots of great dining choices near by and the noise from Yonge Street wasn't a problem, just the odd siren like any other downtown hotel. As there is no onsite parking We parked about 8 minutes away on the esplanade at a manned parking lot at the end of church street. $30.00 for two and a half days which wasn't too outrageous. Would We return to the Victoria? Likely if the price was right but We like to try different places so not likely anytime soon.\\",
            "We recently stayed at this hotel for one night as we were attending a hockey game at the Air Canada Centre. It is located within walking distance and is very close to restaurants, pubs, etc.\\nThe added bonus is if you are attending an event, you can show your ticket on check-in and you will receive a discount on your room.\\nThe hotel room was clean and very comfortable",
            "Hotel Victoria has a great location near many of Toronto's attractions, if you are looking for the fast pace of downtown Toronto. Our family booked two rooms and both were very clean and beautifully decorated. A continental breakfast is included, and the croissants were delicious! The hotel staff is very friendly. The only drawback is that the hotel does not have parking facilities. The closest public parking lot is about 3 blocks away and it will add up if your stay is longer than a night. Overall, staying at Victoria Hotel was very pleasant",
            "We stayed Jun13-15 in the Queen deluxe on the 7th flr. The room was exactly the same as in the picture. The beds were comfy and rooms were very clean. Recommend keeping the fan on to cover street noise. The window blinds do not cover the windows and makes for a very bright 7am. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The restaurant on site was more expensive than Sunset Grill which was only a few blocks north. This hotel is in central downtown within walking distance of shopping, the Rogers Centre and the harbour.  We would definitely recommend this hotel to couples who need a comfortable room to sleep after enjoying the sites of beautiful downtown Toronto. We look forward to our return visit",
            "I've stayed at many hotels in Toronto on business trips that I pay for myself. So I was happy to have everything I needed, no creepy carpet or bedspreads in this spare room with free wi-fi. This is a no frills hotel. This hotel does not provide room service meals or in house restaurant, It is close to good restaurants though. My room had no view but it did have a window so I could let in air and light. You can pay extra if you want pay per view movies, otherwise, you get basic cable which is fine for daily news. It is close to the subway and major streetcars, right downtown so many destinations are walkable.\\nThere is a breakfast restaurant with standard breakfast fare and bad coffee. Convenient if you're not fussy.\\nMy room did have an annoying design flaw in the tiny bathroom, allowing the shower to leak all over the floor, needing many towels to mop up after.\\nStaff was friendly",
            "Great location poor hotel.\\nThe hotels location as great within walking distance of most if the tourist locations in Toronto.but the hotel look like it's been renovated on the cheap. Our door to our room you could see through the gap when closed as the lock was poorly fitted and you could hear when anyone walk in the corridor,our TV didn't work I asked the staff to fix it but they didn't fix it even though I asked repeatedly.wifi was poor.and we couldn't use the Aircon as it was like a jet engine in the room The room has poor lighting and very expensive for what is a very small room. \\nThis place is best if you want a over night stay just sone where to sleep if you have been to a game or concert but not a long stay.no restaurant\\u002Fbreakfast facilities 2 star a bes",
            "We had a great experience overall! Here's my summary:\\nPros: location right on Yonge St can't be beat! We were attending an NHL game and the walk was 10 minutes. Tons of pubs and restaurants all minutes away. Value; can't be beat for a hotel nestled in downtown Toronto. Decor is modern elegant meets old fashioned charm (it was built in 1909!). It was Clean! I cannot stress enough about how important that is to me! Staff were friendly for check-in\\u002Fcheck-out.\\nCons (not really cons but I'm trying to be objective here): very tiny room. We didn't much care though since we were literally just sleeping there and leaving the next day. The hotel does not have parking available. The place they recommend is 10 minutes away (but affordable). The building is very old so 'soundproofing' is non-existent. Not much can be done about that. \\nI would stay here again, hands down",
            "We just returned from Toronto and stayed at the Hotel Victoria on Yonge Street from June 11th-June 15th. I was hesitant at first because of the other reviews posted but from past experience I decided to go with my gut, and with what Frommers had recommended. \\n\\nI made the reservation online and received a prompt response. About a week before we left I emailed them and asked to ensure we received a non-smoking room. I just didn't want to take any chances and all was perfect upon arrival. We checked in about one hour ahead of schedule which was nice b\\u002Fc we wanted to get out and about asap. The staff behind the reception desk seemed to change often which we found amusing. They were all pleasant, not overly, but pleasant and easy to deal with. \\n\\nAs indicated in other reviews, the room was small but clean, and this was more important to me. Clean is a must. The bathroom was quaint and our view was, well, a brick wall but we spent very little time in the hotel room so we weren't worried. The temperature rose as the week went on and the air conditioning worked well. Each day we returned to find our room spotless. The one drawback was the lack of a munchie machine in the hotel. This sounds silly I know but when Game 5 of the Stanley Cup is on you need your munchies. There was a pop machine and ice machine in the basement though. \\n\\nNext door to the hotel was a little newstand\\u002Fconvenience store. We only noticed it on day 3 or so and wish we had found it earlier. It was called International News. The woman there was so nice and welcoming and very chatty. It was great. She asked where we were from and where we were going, etc. This was a great place to grab snacks to sneak into the Jays game. The only problem is it closed around 7pm, but that's ok. The woman there made up for it. \\n\\nThis hotel is all about location, location, location. It was about a 5 min walk from the Eatons Centre. Yonge Street is incredible, full of shopping and restaurants. I highly recommend Eggspectations just up the road and Shopsy's across the street. Yum. It was also practically right next door to the Hockey Hall of Fame. This made it easy to run around, come back and rest a minute, and then keep exploring. \\n\\nThe one thing I really liked about Hotel Victoria is that they were not all gushy over us. We would come and go, they would say hello, and that was about it. The night before we checked out I was stressing b\\u002Fc our flight was only at 8pm and the thought of dragging our luggage around terrified me. I asked the girl at the desk (I think her name was Carla?) if they would keep our luggage after check out for the day and she said it was no problem and it would be locked up until we returned. Fantastic. This was a big help and a huge relief. \\n\\nOne more thing...we never heard a sound from the other rooms or even in the hallways.\\n\\nIf you want a pool, a fabulous in house restaurant, and lots of room....do not go here but if you want good value in a great downtown location then this is the place for you. And I'm picky so trust me.\\",
            "We flew into Toronto and took the public transport from the Airport to the Hotel - you end up on the subway and you can get off near enough to the hotel to wheel your bags no problem. Its simple and v cheap.  We left Toronto after 2 nights by train and walked to the station from the Hotel - we are fit and able and suitcases are on wheels but it was an easy flat walk.  The room was excellent, lovely big comfortable bed, fab sheets and all very clean. The room had a small fridge and coffee machine, old but ok a\\u002Fc, good bathroom and huge closet with iron and board.  There is a great restaurant a few doors down from the Hotel called Marche.  It serves every type of food and drink you could wish for at any time of the day. Its also opposite an Irish Bar.  I booked a king sized deluxe bedroom in advance, we got a room on the top floor with king sized bed and it looked like the top floor was finished!!!  Other floors look like works was still ongoing.  Being high up the city noise and buzz was not a problem but don't expect a view.  We walked everywhere in the city from the Hotel, it really is well situated - staff were friendly and helpful, they booked us a table for supper at CNN tower without a problem",
            "We stayed in the renovated rooms (asked for them specifically on booking) and they were fabulous.  Our rooms were richly appointed with excellent quality linens and other furnishings.  Apple TV was available, as well as wireless internet service (free).  The lobby is gorgeous, and the staff friendly and helpful.  We noted that housekeeping was meticulous and everything, from rooms to common areas were clean and tidy.  You cannot beat the location of this hotel on Younge Street.  You are within walking distance to CN Tower, many fine restaurants, and trolleys that will take you to many great points of interest.  The downstairs restaurant is also pretty good - food is great (especially for breakfast), and prices are reasonable, although service was so-so.  Value for money is spot-on here, and we would definitely recommend.  We shall return",
            "My fiance & I just got back from a wonderful weekend in Toronto.  We picked Hotel Victoria because it was less than 5 minutes walking distance to the ACC and other attractions that we wanted to go to.  Also, Expedia had a 'web special' rate on the hotel for $105 + tax.  The Hotel itself and our room, were very clean, and the frontdesk staff were helpful and offered us an early check-in.  Parking for the hotel was not included, but very close by in Commerce Court on Wellington St.  For approx  28 hours, our parking fee was $24.00, which was reasonable.  We also ate at \\\"Over Easy\\\" the adjoining all-day breakfast restaurant.  The restaurant was very clean and bright, and the food was fresh and homemade.\\nIf you're looking for good value (by Toronto standards) on a night's stay with lots of nearby amenities, and nothing luxurious, this is an excellent pick",
            "Stayed here for a night while attending a concert nearby. Location itself is central & close to entertainment & restaurants. We were fortunate to have good weather and were able to walk everywhere. Reception staff were great. Our room itself was comfortable, clean & bigger than I expected for a boutique hotel. The decor is modern. My only complaint would be the noise from early morning street traffic below which I\\u2019m sure is typical for downtown Toronto. I would stay here again.",
            "Advertised as a boutique hotel, Victoria Hotel delivers on its promises. First, the location is terrific.  Just about 3 blocks from the train station, 1 block from subway and streetcar, near many restaurants, it makes a great base for anyone spending any amount of time in Toronto.\\n\\nOur room was small,  but that was expected. Because it is a heritage building jammed between two new buildings, most of the rooms do not have windows (\\\"fake windows\\\" with a bit of light). If you need a \\\"real\\\" window, you'll need to book a room in the front overlooking Younge Street (probably more expensive).  The room had everything we needed, although the A\\u002FC unit was quite noisy.\\n\\nStaff was friendly and helpful.  All amenities in the rooms. Note that there was no porter to help with the luggage ... not an issue for us.\\n\\nGREAT choice for downtown .... the amenities without breaking the bank",
            "My main requirements for a hotel are nice decor and cleanliness, and the hotel delivered on both counts. I had a standard queen room for three nights on the seventh floor (room 707). I'm a bit paranoid about bed bugs, so I examined the sheets, mattress, duvet, pillows, etc. when I first arrived, and it was all perfectly spotless. In fact, the whole room was spotless, and it was cleaned nicely each day while I was out. I have (over)sleeping issues, so on the second night, I hung the \\\"do not disturb\\\" sign on my door and slept in till about 2:00pm. No one bothered me, and when I came back to the room at night, it had been cleaned. My compliments to the cleaning staff!\\n\\nThe location of the hotel couldn't be better: it's a couple blocks from Union Station, and right in the  middle of the Financial District\\u002FOld Toronto (so lots of gorgeous architecture nearby). There's an entrance to the subway about a block up Yonge Street, many fast food restaurants, coffee shops, and restaurants very close by, and the Eaton Centre is a short walk away. \\n\\nThe bed was extremely comfortable (as everyone seems to agree), the decor was tasteful, there was plenty of lighting, you could adjust the temperature in your room, and the window opened, so you could get some outside air. The shower head had excellent pressure. I liked that the floors were not carpeted - it's more modern and to me, seems cleaner. Only thing is - the hotel's website says the floors are hardwood, but I'm pretty sure they're laminate. In any case, they're nice. The tv was right across from the foot of the bed, and had cable. There was no bathtub, which wasn't a problem for me as I wouldn't have used it anyway - I only point this out because I notice the website says that standard queen rooms have \\\"spacious bathtubs,\\\" which my room didn't have.\\n\\nThe only thing I would change (and I imagine the hotel wants to change as well) is that there is a little space between the glass shower door and the little retaining wall that is supposed to keep the water within the shower unit, meaning there is usually some overspill of water onto the bathroom floor. It wasn't a big deal to me, as I just put a towel there to collect the overspill, but I think it's damaging the wall below the shower over time. \\n\\nIn response to the typical complaints of those who gave the hotel two stars or less, their complaints tend to centre around these areas, which I will respond to so readers can make informed decisions:\\n1) Parking. If you're driving to the hotel, this could be an issue for you if you're not prepared to walk a bit. I took the train, so there was no problem. I wouldn't want to drive in Toronto anyway.\\n2) Lack of bars\\u002Frestaurants\\u002Froom service\\u002Fetc. In my case, I never take advantage of those amenities anyway. I think it's much more interesting to get out of a hotel and explore the city, go to a different place for breakfast each morning, observe the locals, etc. If room service and a mini bar are important to you, keep in mind that this hotel doesn't have them. I believe it does have an onsite breakfast and lunch restaurant, but I didn't go to it, so I can't review it.\\n3) Views from your hotel room window. I'm sure some rooms have views, but my room had a view of the grey brick wall of the building next door. This didn't bother me at all, because I know what the city looks like, so I don't really need to see it while in my room. Also, it means I never had to shut the blinds. If you want more natural light while in your room, you might want to consider requesting a room that doesn't face a wall. There's quite enough lighting in the room otherwise.\\n4) The shower unit was not large, which was not a problem for me, as I'm not very big, but I imagine if you were a larger person width-wise, you might feel crowded. But I only had a standard room - perhaps bigger rooms have bigger bathrooms. \\n5) Noise from the street. I had a room facing a brick wall on the 7th floor. With the window shut, there was no noise at all. With the window open, you'd occasionally hear a honk from a car, people shouting, and so forth. However, I have a tip for travellers ANYWHERE - bring a pair of foam drugstore earplugs! Then street noise\\u002Fnoise on planes or trains won't bother you at all! \\n6) Unfriendliness of staff. I didn't find any evidence that the staff was unfriendly at all. I met what appeared to be a maintenance guy in the elevator, and he even asked me how I was enjoying my stay. I found the front desk people friendly enough. Probably it depends on what mood you catch people in. I never had any problems to address with them, so I wasn't in a bad mood myself.\\n\\nOverall, I would say that if you're a traveller who regards a hotel as mostly a place you retire to at night for sleep (and want to be clean, comfortable, and modern), then you'll love this hotel. If you regard the hotel itself as your holiday, you might want to look elsewhere (because there's no room service). \\n\\nAlso, I believe the hotel was quite recently renovated, so keep this in mind when reading older reviews, because their negatives are probably no longer applicable",
            "This is a budget friendly hotel near to all major attractions in Toronto. You can even walk to all point of interest from this place. Price is basically affordable. Rooms are small but cute. If you\\u2019re not choosy about size this works for people on budget. They have a small lobby and a famous restaurant where they served good food at a low price. Staffs are very good and friendly. They are not too strict on check out time, and you are allowed to leave your luggage with them",
            "The location of this hotel in downtown Toronto can't be beat.  There are stores and restaurants and museums all around, and of course, the Lake isn't far.  We were pleasantly surprised by how quiet our rooms were.  (We stayed in two different rooms on two separate stays.)  We didn't hear noise from adjacent rooms or the street.  And the hotel is right on the Yonge street subway line.  The rooms were perfectly clean.  Many reviews of this hotel mention poor lighting in the rooms.  The hotel must have added lamps recently because, with the lamps and the overhead light turned on, the lighting was certainly adequate.  The front desk staff were very pleasant and helpful.  But there were some drawbacks.  The rooms are very small, and they don't include a chair.  Neither of our rooms had a real chair, although the second one had a low leather stool.  Not comfortable for sitting on.  There's no fridge or microwave in the rooms.  Also, there was no closet in either room.  There was a metal rod about 12 inches long in a corner, with a few hangers on it.  If you travel with a lot of clothes that you like to hang up, this hotel is not for you.  The view out the window in both rooms was of a brick wall.  Don't go to this hotel expecting views of downtown Toronto or the Lake.  The elevator is very slow.  And there was no restaurant or snack shop in the hotel, so we had to go out every morning for breakfast.  But there are plenty of places for breakfast within a few blocks.  All in all, the drawbacks are minor if you're going to Toronto to see the sights.  Just be prepared for the limitations.",
            "The Hotel Victoria is perfectly located on Yonge Street, one half block from a subway station, ten minutes walk from Union Station, and within walking distance of the best Toronto has to offer.  If you are looking for more than location, however, you will be disappointed.  The clean, comfortable rooms are small, (approx. fifteen feet square with ten foot ceilings) with an adequate bathroom.  There is only one small elevator.  We paid approximately $375 for three nights, with an additional $47 to park our car in a nearby garage.  If you are into pools and spas and pampering or are traveling with children, this is definitely not what you're looking for.  If, however, your goal is to blend into the city and explore, you'll be very pleased.\\",
            "I was here for one night on business.  I did a lot of calling around as I am familiar with Toronto and its hotels, this was by far the best value for a limited budget.\\n\\nRoom was clean, bed was big and comfortable, desk was a little too small, view was non-existent but that was fine by me.  Location is great, right downtown, although parking is a pain; I parked at Nathan Phillips Square because all the local parking lots go astronomical for weekdays, so I parked from 3:00 Sunday to 3:00 Monday afternoon for less than $20.00, although I was a ten minute walk from the hotel.\\n\\nWish I'd known about the free internet as I would have taken my laptop; I ended up on a late night run up Yonge St. to an internet cafe to obtain some information I could have gotten for free in my room.\\n\\nPrice is the best thing; it's pretty high season in Toronto, but it was only $135 for a queen room for a night; lowest alternative was $179.  This place is better located than the HoJo on Avenue Road and Bloor, although the latter is a bit cheaper.  I'd place them in the same ballpark quality wise.\\n\\nPeople complain about no restaurant and bar.  I don't get it - Toronto has hundreds or thousands of great restaurants and bars, who would eat at the hotel?  Great Irish bar right across the road where I capped the night with a couple of pints.  Lots of restaurants within short distances",
            "My boyfriend & I stayed for two nights to attend the Muse concert at the Air Canada Center. It was a last minute reservation and I hadn't been in Toronto for years, so I went quickly through some reviews online to find a good spot downtown. The hotel is at very short walking distance of the subway, Union train & bus station, many restaurants and cafes, Eaton Station (10 min), CN tower... But most of all, it offers you this quick access to all the attractions without the boredom of a chain hotel. The lobby itself is quite beautiful, and the room we booked was cool-looking and very clean. We both agreed it was the most confortable bed we ever slept in! The only downside for me was the Wi-Fi connection: while it was free, it was very (very!) slow, and we were located on the third floor. Also, Yonge St. does get noisy even late a night, but nothing earplugs can't deal with. \\n\\nI would definitely stay there again",
            "My sister and I were looking for a cheap, decent hotel in downtown Toronto that would be close to all of the major attractions and public transportation.  For the price (compared to other hotels downtown), I was expecting this hotel to be strictly budget.  It far exceeded my expectations.  It's recently remodeled and it shows.  For $144, we got a deluxe queen room with a mini fridge.  The room was extremely clean and very chic.  The view wasn't the greatest (the windows were dirty) but there wasn't much to see except the stores across the street.  It was very quiet and a great place to crash after hectic days of sightseeing (we stayed for three nights). \\n\\nYou won't get an incredible view like some of the hotels downtown, parking is a pain (I suggest relying on public transportation if you stay here), and there is no pool or exercise room.  It was, however, an extremely good deal for the price, clean, cute, and up-to-date.  The location cannot be beat (you can walk to the lake, the CN tower is a quick streetcar ride away, and the King subway station is a short walk up the street).  I honestly cannot imagine staying anywhere else if I ever visited Toronto agai"

            "To start off, the reception greeted me with smiles and hospitality.  The room was extremely clean and set up with bath salts and nice music.  The bed was like drifting on a soft cloud.  The decor and art were stunning and well thought out.  I felt at home and much relaxed in this hotel and didn't want to leave.  Especially after an amazing massage done right in the convenience of my room.  The staff was extremely accommodating and allowed me a late check out, so I could soak in the tub with some lavender bath salts (tub big enough for two).  mmmm...\\n\\nI would return to this hotel at any opportunity I may have",
            "Had a girl trip July 7th thru July11th and had picked The Ivy at Verity.  So glad we did!  It was wonderful.  Couldn't hardly get out of bed in the morning because the bed was like sleeping on a cloud!  The breakfast was amazing.  Fresh croissants and banana bread, fruit and yogurt. The pool area was beautiful and relaxing.  The highlight was George, our concierge, who was too wonderful for words!  He was so helpful with helping plan our day and making suggestions for us.  He found out we loved iced tea, so always had it ready for us at any time of the day.  He booked our day trip to Niagra Falls, which was wonderful.  We didn't want to leave!  I would never want to stay anyplace else in Toronto.  Loved it, loved it!  Miss you now, George!!  You made our trip the best",
            "My husband and I have stayed at the Ivy at Verity twice as an overnight getaway in the city. Each time we purchased a package which included one massage, dinner for 2 at George (restaurant associated with Verity), room and breakfast. The package offers excellent value. The rooms are beautiful (especially the bathrooms) and everything is elegant and luxurious. Food at George is excellent. We have food allergies and restrictions that the chef has always accomodated. We find that the chef has a preference for fois gras which we find too heavy so we make sure to ask the staff to exclude this. We've been to the Hyatt in downtown Toronto and prefer the Ivy to it",
            "Beautiful, comfortable,exceeded expectations,highly recommended,luxurious room, delicious breakfast, excellent location near to shopping ( Eaton centre )  close to performing arts centre, free wifi , wonderful staff, felt right at home immediately, quite and cozy,more at coffe shop next doo",
            "My daughter (age 15) and I stayed for one night at the Ivy as part of a March Break getaway. We are from Toronto and wanted one night downtown while we shopped at the Eaton Centre and went to the AGO. Our room was beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. Next time, we will add in a trip to the Spa. Very luxurious - Highly recommend",
            "This is a really great hotel.  Only 4 rooms but all are super lovely.  The size room is fantastic.  It's beautifully decorated and the bed is truly amazing (I'll be buying a Hastens bed one day!).  Other benefits of staying there are access to Verity club sitting area, access to George's food (the restaurant) via room service and walking down to Sweetgrass spa in your bathrobe.  Staff are super nice as well.  A few things to be aware of....this area is pretty quiet on Sundays.  It's really, really hard to find a place to find lunch (nothing is available from IVY as well as George is closed).  Don't depend on the complimentary breakfast to get your morning started.  The baked goods are OK to bland and there are too many fruit flies flying around the other things (fruit salad, orange juice) to make them appetizing.  That's fine if it's a weekday - as you can step out and go next door to the cafe.  But on Sunday, you're a bit stuck for options.   That said - I can still look pass these small issues and enjoy my stay there!  Worth considering the next time your in Toronto",
            "My wife and I celebrated our 6th wedding anniversary in July and booked a room at the Ivy and dinner at George.  The hotel and restaurant were amazing. I have stayed at other upscale hotels in Toronto like the Trump and I think the Ivy is excellent value for the price and the service is terrific. We stayed in room #4 which was very spacious and faced a beautiful courtyard. I definitely would stay here again",
            "I found the Ivy on hotels.com. Thought it sounded unique and it is! Four gorgeously and differently appointed rooms. Huge bathroom with rain shower and deep soaking tub, including in-house-made, complimentary bath salts - a nice touch after a long day of walking. There is an honor bar with white wine, liquors, and soft drinks. Also tea bags and instant coffee. Continental breakfast is included and it is quite ample - yogurt\\u002Fgranola, boiled egg, croissant or muffin, juices, and coffee\\u002Fcream. Really nice.\\n\\nThe only difficulty that I encountered was a previously unannounced electricity outage one night from 10pm to 4am the following morning. WEIRD. A letter left in my room. No explanation. Battery lantern and flashlight provided. \\n\\nThe building is in a sort of run-down block of Queen St just a bit east of the better parts of Queen St West. But I did not feel unsafe. \\n\\nThere is a great women's clothing store a few doors down. Don't miss it! And an excellent antiques store in the the next block east. Plenty of good restaurants a block or two away as well as the upscale George attached.\\n\\nLovely subterranean swimming pool and hot tub. And a spa",
            "Exceptional and almost up there with the fastiduously superb hotel 41 in London, or, a favourite, the Charlotte St hotel in Fitzrovia, London. We stayed 2 nights for an anniversary and the staff could not have done more to help make our stay a wonderful experience. Unfortunately the affiliated Georges restaurant was shut the evenings we stayed (Sun\\u002FMon) but we were recomended a superb local steak house (Berberians) and the Georges Lunch on Monday was excellent. \\n\\nOverall a really fabulous stay and our only suggestions would be to put some cheap pens or pencils in the room to note down stuff without having to rummage through the executive carrier bags!\\n\\nOverall a rare gem, but we did feel that it needs to communicate a clear proposition; as a fabulous boutique hotel, a fine dining experience, a club,a ladies health spa, or,  all 4",
            "A Gem in a perfect location. Where do I begin. I was greeted by a super nice and friendly staff. I was early for an appointment but interested in my wedding possibly there. I met with planner immediately who was a sweetheart. Just for any thinking about a wedding there, the prices can't be beat!  When I returned I was taken up to my room. The hotel is so lush, with velvet, satin,art work, a library and lounge. One of my favourite features is the honour bar which has inexpensive drinks, free pop, and a espresso coffee machine and tea. The best part was it was right out my bedroom door. The continental breakfast was just the right amount and delicious. The room was just WOW!  It was huge and the wonderful scent from the bath crystals was light yet a delight to the senses. The fixtures were unusual and very artsy. The bathroom was huge! Everything was soft and plush from towels, bedding and bath robes. I only had the pleasure of one night so not enough time to explore all the hotel and neighborhood had to offer. The menu was on a tablet, unlike some hotels where they are a bit used and messy. If you needed something, a friendly staff member was there quickly. I really can't say enough about this wonderful hotel and staff!  Thank you for an amazing night",
            "I am fortunate enough to be a member of the club and the room happened to be available that evening. Ivy is an experience everyone should have. It is truly a hidden gem within downtown Toronto. You are in heaven in downtown Toronto! Peaceful, stunning rooms, incredible service, fantastic atmosphere, luxury and pampering at its best.\\n\\nWhat made me incredibly sad though was that they don't allow dogs; that's about the worst thing I can say :(\\n\\nIf you are lucky enough to be able to get in you would be crazy to pass up on the opportunity!\\n\\nL",
            "We just left Toronto and loved our stay at the Ivy at Verity. The hotel is at a women's club and there are only four rooms, so taxi drivers tour buses, etc may not be familiar with it. Just made us more thankful we found this hidden gem. We actually stayed in two different rooms for our two night stay (2 and 4). Both were very specious, with large balconies, tasteful decor, and lots of natural light. The beds were super comfortable and it was very cozy and upscale at the same time. The bathrooms were huge. The staff was very responsive and helpful, particularly George. They provided a simple breakfast and were very eager to help with any questions we had. A great place for a couples getaway. We also enjoyed appetizers in the club's lounge and were very impressed with the quality of the food",
            "The Ivy isn\\u00B4t so much a classical hotel. It\\u00B4s a business club with serveral nice meeting lounges, a lady fitness studio, a spa and perhaps the best restaurant \\\"George\\\" I have ever eaten at. We were told - also there was no one, when we we stayed - that the Ivy is a hot spot for weddings in Toronto. And I can understand this.\\n\\nThe rooms - they only have four, so feel yourself luck if you get one - are big and lovely decorated, with over king size beds which might be the most comfortable I ever had sleeped in, a big bath - seperated shower and closet - with Bulgari toiletries and several different bathing salts available for disposal in the big bathing tube.\\n\\nThe breakfast - croissant, cake, fresh fruit and juice, coffee or tea, everything excellent - was offered on tray outside the room on an old french pastries table and had to be carried in your room. We ate it on our balcony with view to the patio. Great start of the day. Coffee (Nespresso) and softdrinks were complimentary the whole day. \\n\\nThe hotel itself is very central, probably 10 min walk to Eaton Center with a subway station just around the corner and big public parking space on the other side of the street.\\n \\nSo go there, even if you don\\u00B4t want to mary",
            "On the positive, The Ivy is a lovely, tiny (it only has 4 rooms) boutique hotel in Toronto.  The room we had was luxurious and huge, as was the bathroom and bed! \\n\\nThe bathroom had a separate shower and bath and the toilet was in a separate cubicle within the bathroom. There was a range of three bath salts to choose from!\\n\\nHowever, we found the breakfast to be a little hit and miss given we ordered practically the same things on both days but the quantities varied between the two days.  Also it would have been nice if someone had knocked on the door to let us know breakfast had been served (this would be common practice in the UK) so on the first day it took us 5-10 mins to realise the tray had been delivered by which time my hot water wasn't quite so hot.  When we did realise breakfast was there we found that there were no cups or milk. When we phoned reception we were advised there would be some in the lounge which no-one had told us about :-(\\n\\nWhilst we found the hotel to be close enough to many attractions (we walked to most places) and only 5 mins from a metro station we did feel it was a little out of the way and not the most salubrious district.\\n\\nGiven that The Ivy is within a ladies-only club and, as I was with my husband, we didn't use any of the other hotel facilities as they weren't available to him however, we were aware of this when we booked. \\n\\nOverall, it is a lovely hotel and feels very opulent once you are in the building itself. The staff were lovely and it was a good start to our first trip to Canada",
            "We absolutely loved this hotel. The staff was so welcoming and helpful. The room was beautiful and the bathroom was perfect. \\nThis hotel is owned by the women's club and was originally used exclusively by the club for when they had guests in town. Now anyone can book a room if you are lucky enough to nab one. There are only four rooms in the entire hotel and they are separated away from the rest of the club so it is very quiet. The rooms are very large with a king bed and beautiful full wall windows with a door onto a private balcony. Each room is color coded and unique. the bathroom comes with heated floors, a separate room for the toilet, an amazing shower, and the largest bath tub I have ever seen. I am 6'2\\\" and I could stretch out in the tub with room to spare. The added bonus is the in house made bath salt that they provide in three different scents.\\nYou also get breakfast delivered to your door. It is not a large meal but it gets you through to lunch. \\nThe last thing I have to say is that you MUST have dinner at George while you are there. This restaurant specializes in tasting menus for all dietary plans. The biggest benefit is that after your three hour multi -course meal you just have to walk up the hidden staircase to your room (never leaving the building). \\nI will definitely stay here again if ever back in Toronto",
            "We stayed here after our wedding before going home to Etobicoke, and I am so happy that we did! We arrived late (about 1am?) and the concierge was there to greet us and take a breakfast order. The room was well-appointed - beautiful furniture, gorgeous lighting, a patio overlooking the courtyard.  The bed was easily the most comfortable I've ever slept on in my life. And the bathroom! HUGE tub, heavenly salts, separate toilet and shower stalls... just to die for. Breakfast was juice, coffee\\u002Ftea, pastries, yogurt & fruit -- and was waiting on a tray for us in the lobby area which also had a nice bar to choose from (though we weren't in the mood to take advantage of it seeing as it was 9am). I would recommend this place to everyone",
            "We had an excellent time here. The massage package with the room for two can be used by one person for the full hour by a RMT therapist. The breakfast consisted of coffee, a choice of freshly squeezed juice, pastry's, fresh fruit offered on a tray outside of your room. They have a small area to sit or you can bring your tray to your room.\\nThe hallways are so confusing of how to get to your room or even how to get to the reception area, although they were very accommodating to help you find your way. It was a nice treat with the spa downstairs for the following day.\\nVery close to the Eaton Centre. A great part of the city. It truly was a welcomed treat",
            "The Ivy at Verity has a lot of charm. Located in an old chocolate factory, the interior of the hotel as well as our room had been given a lot of attention to detail. Our room was decorated in a warm and lush way and the amenities were great such as the selection of home made bath salts. Service was also good and friendly. The bed, manufactured by the world famous Hastens bed manufacturer, was superb: one of the best beds we have ever slept in (apart from home...). There were a couple of drawbacks which you might want to take into account when booking this hotel:\\n\\n- It is located in not the best part of Toronto with a lot of homeless people on the streets.\\n- The hotel does not provide their own parking facilities. There is a municipal parking lot just across the street but quite expensive ($ 24 overnight) and not guarded, and a parking garage closeby (however, our SUV couldn't enter as the maximum height was 2 meters).\\n- There is no hotel entrance parking nor a porter service so for the not too light traveller somewhat inconvenient because of the busy street.\\n- The balcony is located at the back and the adjacent building has huge airconditioning vents that make a lot of noise which is not so nice when you want to enjoy a glass of wine outside your room. The same by the way applies to the patio of the George restaurant which you can overlook from the balcony and that is right under these vents. We cannot imagine this to be a nice dinner experience hence we didn't try it and ate elsewhere.\\n\\nThere is a turn-down service but it follows kind of strict timings so one night when we went out for dinner at about 9.30 housekeeping was not able to do this. Our dvd player turned out not to function which was a pity as we wanted to watch a dvd we received after one of us doing the CN tower edgewalk. All in all a very nice boutique hotel but with some areas of attention in terms of location",
            "My husband and I stay in Toronto every few months so like to try different hotels each time. Recent stays have included Intercontinental Yorkville, Pantages, and Ritz-Carlton. For our latest stay, we booked a room at The Ivy at Verity. I can honestly say I've never had a more lovely hotel stay! The staff seemed very proud to work there and were both warm and professional.\\nThe room we stayed in (Room 1) was large and beautifully appointed ... The care they've put into decorating each room is apparent in every fabric and furniture choice. The bed was luxuriously comfortable and the bathroom spoiled us with heated floors, marble vanity and a selection of aromatherapy bath salts. \\nThe common area immediately outside the rooms is a charming space with a large granite table used for drinks in the afternoon and breakfast in the morning. Alcohol was $6 a drink (very reasonable) and done on the honour system...all the drinks were out on the table and you filled out a card with what you drank to bring to the concierge later for payment. Espresso and soda was free as was the wifi and a continental breakfast. That breakfast was also delicious! Large flaky, buttery croissants, yoghurt and granola, hard boiled eggs, and juice were waiting on trays labelled with each room number and you simply rang the concierge to have fresh coffee delivered when you woke up.  \\nI didn't want to leave! I can't wait to try this hotel in the summer and enjoy the lovely terrace.\\nWell done, Ivy... You've created a little oasis in the heart of the city",
            "The Ivy at Verity is a tiny hotel. The set up seems odd at first... it is an exclusive women's club with gym, spa, library, lounges etc, and tucked away on a upper floor, the 4 lovely and spacious guest rooms.  The rooms overlook a court yard and face the windows of an ad agency, where you can see folks working away. At first it felt a bit like we were in a bedroom at work. We kept our drapes closed and all was well. As a woman, all of the amenities were amazing. I think if I had been travelling with a male companion it would have been disappointing.  I was in room three and it was BEAUTIFUL.  Just my style. Very comfortable king bed, incredible bathroom with an irresistible bathtub. All of the soaps and salts and lotions were really lovely and great quality. The room had lots of plush seating, and huge balcony. The honour bar, just outside of the rooms was a really nice touch - although when I was there it was not properly stocked and was never replenished, even after two calls to the concierge. Location is central enough to walk downtown, has a transit stop right out front, and there is paid parking directly across the street. I thought the breakfast was quite good. This will always be my first choice hotel when I stay in Toronto, I really loved it",
            "My wife and I took a recent holiday to Canada and started the holiday by staying at the Ivy at Verity for our first 4 nights.This is a quirky boutique style hotel situated just outside downtown Toronto. Based in what was once a chocolate factory this hotel only has four rooms but has extensive accommodation which is used for conferences etc.The rooms are beautifully furnished each with a different theme and each has an outside balcony overlooking an inner courtyard.The bathroom in particular was quite spectacular and the bedroom very spacious.The staff were extremely friendly and helpful.Continental breakfast was not extensive but more than adequate and good quality.The hotel was very quiet and in a good position to reach both the hop on hop off bus service on foot and for access to the various downtown areas on foot.Plenty of restaurants in the vicinity.Highly recommended",
            "It's official--The Ivy at Verity is now my new favourite hotel in all of Toronto. From the moment I was greeted at the front door to the morning I left I felt incredibly welcomed and spoiled. The rooms are beautifully decorated and luxurious, I appreciated the self serve open bar set-up outside my door and can't even describe how amazing my meal at the George restaurant was. Incredible experience. I would (and will) highly recommend this hotel to anyone travelling to Toronto from now on. Amazing accommodations",
            "We stayed at the Ivy for one night -- our honeymoon -- and it was fantastic. It is truly an oasis in the heart of downtown Toronto and you will be pampered! The beds are so plush, you will not want to get out of bed. We especially enjoyed the very spacious and stylish bathrooms, especially the very large and lovely soaking tub and showers. Can't wait to go back",
            "The Ivy at Verity ( a private women's club in downtown Toronto) attached to 5 star dining at George Restaurant with it's own private courtyard patio.\\nPosh but cozy, exclusive but welcoming. So beautiful and stylish but with plenty of substance. The people are warm and helpful and the beds are Hastens so the best sleep ever acheived. There is a Verity spa (complete with hot tub, steam room, and sauna ) on property called Sweetgrass that is exclusive for women but men staying in the hotel can have treatments in their hotel room. They even have fitness facilities (again, exclusive to women)  and you can add on a yoga class if you want for a nominal fee.\\nFabulous stay, incredible bed, God is here, in the deails",
            "I have not one complaint about this hotel. It is beautiful, and stunningly decorated. There are only four rooms, with private balconies, and they are clean and luxurious. Incredibly comfortable beds\\u002Fpillows. Gorgeous bathrooms with Bvlgari shampoos&ody washes. The Verity contains several meeting rooms, a library, and an all-womans' spa (odd, right?!). The staff was very kind, and helpful. We checked in late, our in-room safe didn't work, and they replaced it immediately. Another front desk manager (Michael?) went out of his way to help us find affordable transportation to an out-of-the way concert that we were trying to attend. We had a complimentary continental breakfast, which was delivered to the \\\"honor bar\\\" outside of the guest rooms. (I have never had freshly pressed cranberry juice!!). The George Restaurant, which is, essentially, below the guest rooms (though, we were never disturbed by the diners) is absolutely fabulous!!!!!!\\nMy only complaint is that this hotel is on a rather seedy section of the street. The downtown  location is ideal for great restaurants (Origin, Blowfish on Bay, Canoe), and Toronto highlights, it seems out of place. There are several, what appear to be, homeless shelters within a block of the hotel. East Queen Street seemed to have a constant flow of indigent people flowing in, and out, of the McDonalds on the corner. I felt a little uncomfortable walking back each night, and I am from NYC. We never had any issues, but it struck me as odd that this gem of a hotel was in the wrong neighborhood.",
            "OMG. This is a boutique hotel with only 4 rooms in it. The service, facilities and the rooms are amazing to say the least. What a great gem in Toronto. We're looking forward to returning the next time that we're in Toronto. Everything was perfect",
            "Not only our favorite place in Toronto, the Ivy at Verity is one of the nicest and most perfects hotels we have ever stayed at.  My mom and I, who take a trip every year, enjoyed the spacious and intricately decorated Room # 3.  Everything was spotless, comfortable, and beautiful.  Every detail of this \\\"hotel\\\" (more like an oasis) was designed and thought through.  I oftentimes found myself wanting to return to the Ivy and other areas of Verity (Sweetgrass Spa, Member's lounge, Library, Computer area) to lounge in the chairs, hang out on the room's large private patio, have a drink at the private honor bar, or take a dip in the pool or bath (prepared with salts and tea preparations).  The concierge was available 24hrs and extremely kind and helpful in accommodating any of our needs or desires, altering our daily delivered breakfasts, making reservations and offering suggestions catered to our likes, and personally introducing us to the host at George Restaurant before our reservation.  We cannot say enough good things about the Ivy\\u002FVerity\\u002FSweetgrass Spa, where you can find every amenity at high quality, spectacular service, and a beautiful ambience.  It is private but alive, and suited for a getaway, for business, and for romance.  With an entrance through Verity, as well as a private entrance (with secure coded door) for the rooms, a guest can customize his\\u002Fher stay.  The location was central to many places such as a few blocks from the subway, or a walk to St. Lawrence Market\\u002FDundas.  We cannot wait to return and could have enjoyed many more days at the Ivy at Verity!  Thank you for a wonderful experience",
            "This is a little lovely hotel. It is close to Eaton Center and close to the Hop on Hop off busses.\\nDe service is excellent and the people are very nice. If I come back to Toronto I would stay there again.\\nCompliments for this hotel\\u002Fbed and breakfast",
            "I've been staying in Marriotts, Hiltons and Holiday Inns for over 4 years with work, but it's only by coming to The Ivy that I'm reminded how good a hotel experience you can have if you go to the boutique places.\\nThe first thing is even though this is effectively 'an old boys club for women', my wife booked it for our first trip to Toronto and we both found it to be utterly beautiful, relaxing and a joy to stay in. We could happily move into room 3 and never leave, the bed and bathroom are brilliant, the honesty bar and espresso machine outside the room make you feel at home to come and go as you please, the staff were super friendly and helpful, and even though the spa is women only they allowed us in after hours. As for the George restaurant, we've never had a better tasting menu anywhere in the world. A rare foodie experience I'll not forget in a hurry.\\nOne of those places that genuinely nourishes your body and mind. Can't say enough good things about it",
            "The rooms at the Ivy are so beautiful, you really don't want to leave them.  Save time to enjoy the spa like bath, with an assortment of scented salts and heated floors - enjoy a drink or breakfast on the balcony overlooking the secluded patio of the George restaurant - and make sure you get your full eight hours sleep in the heavenly beds - amazing comfort and luxury.  The rooms are beautifully appointed, each one with a different interior design, and unlike anything you would get at a large chain hotel.  Within walking distance of downtown Toronto, the Ivy is conveniently located albeit off the beaten path.  We liked being able to enjoy a bottle of champagne in the seating area outside the rooms as a group - almost like being in your own home - before heading downstairs to the wonderful George restaurant. Personal and knowledgable concierge staff - access to Internet and computers - on site spa - and ambience from the exclusive Verity Women's Club.  I have stayed at the Ivy many times, and already am looking forward to my next visit",
            "The Ivy is a little off the beaten track in Toronto but the room and especially bathroom was worth the walk! Breakfast and services were superb. \\nChoose the Ivy if you are into boutique hotels, luxury - and not up for B&Bs or big hotels. This place is something special",
            "We live in Toronto and were celebrating- my birthday, my husbands birthday and my best friend's and her husband's birthday all fall within a month of each other, so we decided this year to celebrate in style- a night at the Ivy. We kicked things off first at the Sweetgrass spa (for women only) then enjoyed a 10 course tasting menu on George's beautiful courtyard patio.\\n \\nGoing with another couple allowed me to gawk at their room too (room #1). I love how this hotel has only four rooms and all are tasteful and elegant, and so different. Our room (#3) was a glamorous blend of modern mixed with classic timeless materials, a nod to their chocolate factory past. Gorgeous blue wallpaper is charming against the relic brick of a bygone era. The rooms themselves are massive, much roomier than any other downtown hotel I've seen. With different seating areas to recline and relax, including a sunny deck that faces George's patio, my husband and I loved every minute of our stay. The bathroom has a super deep soaker tub and inviting aromatic bath salts- they have clearly anticipated your every thought! \\nOne feature I loved was the Samsung tablet that you use to control the television, but also acts as a portable TV, which they have linked to Netflix...cue the Orange is the New Black marathon! \\n\\nMy bestie's room was an intimate portrait of a Parisian hotel, soft pink striped wallpaper was welcoming and warm. Her room was every bit as luxurious as mine, every detail carefully constructed. \\n\\nI can't wait to come back, absolutely adore the staff, spa and restaurant here. It's a rare gem in a city full of over-done, over hyped hotels (IMHO). Nice gestures like the honour bar and delicious complimentary breakfast are just the finishing touches to a spoiled brat weekend. Thanks Ivy",
            "We live in Toronto, but I surprised my husband with  here for one night on our wedding anniversary in April 2014.  He had no idea there were even rooms at the Verity and was excited (perhaps unnecessarily) that we were visiting a \\\"ladies club\\\" for our anniversary, ha ha. Our experience was so positive from start to finish. It's such a little gem. Our room rivalled any hotel room we've been to around the world--gorgeous huge bathroom, comfy beds, beautiful amenties. The honour bar was lovely too, so quaint. Staff were excellent..rooms were beautifully maintained, well cleaned, front desk staff was attentive etc. My husband had in in room massage and I had a manicure downstiars--the BEST it lasted for over a week!)--plus one of the ladies gave me a make up lesson at the fun\\u002Finteractive make up bar. Spa is really lovely.  Then we had a great dinner at George (food was out of this world although the waiter was a bit haughty). Overall I would highly recommend the Ivy and the package we had. A great escape in the city",
            "We actually found this place through Hotels.com, it had very high ratings which were confirmed on Trip Adviser. The place is amazing, we would absolutely stay there again. The room was incredible, I had ordered flowers from their in-house florist for the room, they were in room at check-in, my wife LOVED them! Right colours and had opened up to where we were able to enjoy them during our stay. We cannot say enough about the bed, was the BEST we have ever slept in, and we have a Tempurpedic. Bathroom was a dream room, large tub, oversize shower and heated floors. What we loved most, this was a Romantic getaway for us, we felt like we were the only ones in the place. The only way we knew there were other guests was by the 3 other breakfast trays on the table waiting to be picked up in the morning. You cannot beat the location, 2 blocks from Eaton's Centre and the Subway, a quick 10 minute walk to the St. Lawrence Market. We had only minor issues, when we checked in I was handed back my driver's license but not my credit card. Spent the morning worrying if I had lost it, only to find out that it was at reception. They apologized and said they did not want to disturb us with a call, HELLO call, slip a note under the door, something! One review mentions vacuuming in the middle of the night, we heard that too, at about midnight right above our room, very loud but only for a few minutes. This was on the Friday night, not Sat or Sun. One last thing, when we checked in the concierge took our breakfast order, asked what time we wanted the nightly bed turn down and what time we wanted the room made up. Each day Housekeeping did not have the room made up until 2-3 hours after the time we had requested. In the grand scheme of things these were minor issues that are easily corrected. They will not influence our choosing to stay there again when we return to Toronto. A true gem",
            "This centrally located downtown Toronto hotel is extremely spacious, beautifully appointed and impeccably conceived. I'd like to move in. (The continental breakfast delivered to your door, the heated flooring in the very large bathroom, the generous balcony overlooking the intimate brick courtyard, the gorgeous drapes and furniture...) And yes, of course, all the technology required for a 21st century traveler",
            "Definitely not your usual hotel. Looking for a home away your home.....This is the place where to go when you are in Toronto. Even if not located in some fancy neighborhoods, this place is a gem. At first a \\\"Women's club\\\" , the Ivy offers some rooms now... Mine was .. Yes ... awesome. A large room with a large bed, a pretty big bathroom with for the first time ever of my life a bath salt \\\"bar\\\" ... Breakfast it serve at your door at the requested time. Might be a little bit light (missing some toasts and butter), ordered croissants and chocolate brioche and ends-up with a muffin with grapes   ... But this was good.\\nTeam is great ... I will highly recommend this place ... Especially if you are a woman ... Next time i will try the SPA",
            "Strange setting, 4 room hotel inside a women's only networking club in central Toronto.\\nSet in a beautifully renovated industrial complex, the room was a treat to the senses, salts for the bath, special wood floors in the bathroom. Everything about the room was perfect. We also had a beautiful little terrace overlooking a courtyard where we had breakfast.\\nThe affiliated George restaurant was also magnificent, and all the staff was attentive and knowledgable.\\nI loved the place.\\nI'll definitely go back",
            "This is a very small hotel with only 4 rooms in a old building. It was our last stop on our holidays in Canada and we did enjoy it a lot. The room is very nicely done and does also have a great terrace. There are many small details which are great and show the attention to details. The quality of the room is very high and the staff makes the stay also a great experience. \\nThe hotel also features a women\\u2018s only spa and a gourmet restaurant. \\n\\nThe location of the hotel is also great to explore Toronto without a car",
            "Found this hotel on Expedia, and the more I read I about it, the more curious I got, as it was 'boutique' and 'euro influenced'. I booked it based on reviews and that it would be perfect for my wedding anniversary. After arriving, it surpassed our expectations. The room's were fantastic, very spacious and clean with a balcony, the decor was in great taste, the bed was great,  the food at their neighbour restaurant 'George' was fantastic, and the staff (in particular George and Jen) made every effort to make our stay enjoyable. I was so relaxed by the time I checked out of the hotel, that I forgot my laptop cord, and within 2hrs, I had an email from the staff letting me know that I left it behind. It's a great hotel which Toronto should be proud of",
            "The Ivy is a wonderful boutique hotel in downtown Toronto.  Everything in the room is top notch from the overall spaciousness of the room, the decor, the walk-in shower room, the deep soaking tub, upscale ammenities etc.  The staff were attentive and accommodating and helped make our stay a great one.  We would recommend this hotel highly to anyone",
            "We stayed here for an evening and had dinner at George restaurant.  What a fabulous experience.  If you are travelling to Toronto, it is walking distance to the financial district, Yonge Street, the Eaton Center shopping mall and great restaurants.  The room was sooo cozy, heated flooring, spacious bathrooms with various scented bath salts, contemporary design.  The breakfast in the morning was right outside the door and we enjoyed eatting in bed.  Dinner at George was AMAZING.  The food, the service were top notch.  I highly recommend it.  There are only a few rooms, each one is decorated differently.  The spa though is women only, so sorry guys. If you are looking for a boutique hotel that is cozy, in a great location and can splurge, Verity is for you",
            "This boutique hotel is exactly that. Small, but beautifully put together. Staff were all fantastic. Rooms perfect. Best bathrooms we've found in Canada, and when the weather allows a lovely veranda to sit on. Attached is a ladies health club and spa, and if I lived in Toronto I would join. Can you start one in England  - preferably near where I live \\uD83D\\uDE04 Husband and I had a champagne breakfast to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It was lovely",
            "Spent a wonderful weekend in Toronto at The Ivy at Verity.  A boutique hotel with just 4 rooms. Our was beautifully decorated, spacious with an amazing bathroom.   They have thought of everything -- honor bar, round the clock concierge and unique touches like freshly brewed tea to enjoy while you soak in a huge tub soaking in specially chosen bath salts.   It was a truly magical experience.   Can't imagine every staying anywhere else in Toronto.   Book ahead so you won't miss out",
            "This hotel is part of a small, elegant upscale spa and restaurant complex and women's club. The restaurant is superior as are the spa facilities and the rooms.  Decoration is in impeccable taste in every part of the complex.  The beds are British--Hypnos is the brand.  They are ultra-luxury in price; more importantly, they make for an exceptional sleep. We had a perfect escape to an elegant oasis in the middle of Toronto in the winter.  Highly recommended",
            "The Ivy is a hidden gem in the centre of Toronto.  Spacious beautifully decorated rooms, luxurious linens and the bathrooms are stocked with the best toiletries - a deep bath and separate shower stall.  You  feel pampered and regenerated.  Great dinner package options at George restaurant and spa options at the spa. Small and personal - treat yourself",
            "We chose the Ivy's Urban Retreat package for one night as a way to celebrate our anniversary in Toronto. In the city, there are no shortage of luxury hotel options, but it can be difficult to find a place to stay that is really in the \\\"boutique\\\" category while offering privacy, luxury, fun, and peace while away from home. In just about every category for evaluation, the Ivy excels. This 4-room hotel downtown stands out and above other options in Toronto, and we're thrilled to have discovered it.\\n\\nYou can request a particular room when booking, and we chose room #2. With a calming colour scheme, plenty of space, a gorgeous marble bathroom (deep tub and huge shower room!), and a large flat screen with a blu-ray player, it's well-outfitted, comfortable, and very quiet. You have access to a refreshments area with honour bar and complimentary soft drinks, as well as access to the members only lounge area, which we didn't make use of. Their packages have incredible value, and we had the chance to enjoy an included five-course meal at the onsite George restaurant and an hour long massage at the onsite Sweetgrass spa. \\n\\nTo clarify some confusion amongst the reviews and elsewhere, Verity is the parent company here and responsible for the spa and restaurant, as well as the hotel. The spa (and this includes all available fitness facilities) is women only, but this absolutely does not mean that men are somehow unwelcome. In fact, should you wish, men can request in-room spa services. As a male guest, I absolutely loved my stay here, and my partner was able to make use of the beautiful spa facilities. \\n\\nToronto seems to be a city where it can be difficult to feel as if value matches cost for accommodations. The Ivy at Verity bucks this unfortunate trend and offers an experience we hope to someday return for",
            "I stayed at this hotel on business when my normal go-to options (Park Hyatt, Shangri-La, and Ritz) were fully booked.  I was nervous about trying a boutique hotel in Toronto in a neighborhood I was less-familiar with, but it paid off.  I instantly fell in love with this hotel and have recommended it now to at least 20 people.  I was in town attending a luxury travel tradeshow as I am in hotel sales.  Everyone, even the locals were surprised to hear about this little gem.  Service, decor, and overall concept were all above average!  I loved that it was designed with women in mind",
            "Love this place, love Toronto.  Been here 3x in the past year and will be returning soon.  Beautiful retreat.  Wonderful to walk downstairs to George for dinner, to the spa for a massage, or up the street to the subway to get around the city.  Staff is first rate, attentive, and respectful of my privacy. It's expensive but the price is fair",
            "I had the chance to stay here during one of my trip to Toronto. A very nice and classy hotel. The service quality is excellent, the room warm, beautiful and the staff very friendly. I definitely recommend it",
            "Amazing getaway in the heart of Toronto.  Great location, only four rooms in the entire hotel, gorgeous boardrooms, library, balconies.  The hotel rooms are enormous, luxurious, romantic and spotless.  The spa downstairs is just for women (which was kind of wonderful) but the male half of a couple might feel a little left out.  Then he should remind himself that he gets paid more than his wife does to do the same job\\u2026 and go relax in the giant bathtub instead"

Nice view of the city, great location (close to union station and eaton centre), and really warm and welcoming staff. I was greeted and helped by Muhammad and Wonde on valet service, and Joana at front desk was the best at checking us in. The most memorable stay I've had so far",
            "My husband and I went to One King West on the night of our wedding. We arrived at 2 am and Deekshi who was our guest service specialist, made our stay so wonderful. We went to our room to find rose petals and champagne waiting for us. She gave us vouchers for a free coffee and pastry in the morning and she extended our check out time - all without us asking for this treatment. We also forgot our toothbrushes and she provided us with little complimentary kits that had toothbrushes and toothpaste. She was just so kind and it made all the difference for us tired newlyweds! The room itself was clean and beautiful. We can\\u2019t recommend this hotel enough! Thanks Deekshi",
            "One King West offered a haven for us to celebrate our special day in great comfort and style. Our valet was prompt enough to take our car and let us in where we were greeted and welcomed with a smile by the concierge staff!\\nI had wanted a special surprise gift for my husband placed im the room before we checked in and they had thoughtfully arranged everything as per request. The room was at the right temperature and very clean. The view was just as expected and we had some delicious Truffle fries brought in on time by room service staff. We then explored the historic vault and other features of the hotel like Austin gallery and the historic elevators etc which was a great way to get to know the value of the hotel we chose to spend our special day in. \\nBreakfast at Daily Ritual was also wonderful where we savoured fresh hot coffee and breakfast sandwiches. We were served complimentary pastries too which was very nice.\\nI would highly recommend One King West to anyone who looka forward to top class stay away from home on any occassion",
            "Love, love, love always coming back to One King West for our staycation, we asked our parents to join as well this time and they absolutely loved everything. Our favourite Hotel in downtown, the team here really goes out of there way to ensure that everything is taken care of, always there when you need anything. Valet and Front desk teams are the most hospitable that I have ever encountered,  we had a Great Lake view room, gorgeous views and the suite was perfectly cleaned and the teams were noticed following all Covid measures. Can\\u2019t wait to come back again, thank you One King for making this visit special for our family",
            "I booked the Historic Superior Suite - Interior View for one night as a surprise for my boyfriends birthday. Due to a small error and quick switch of rooms, with an upgrade to a room with a gorgeous view, we had a spectacular time at One King West! \\nThe room was beautiful, it had a separate living area with a couch, a small kitchenette, spacious and clean bathroom, super comfortable bed and a television in each room. The breathtaking view of the city, the lake and the gorgeous CN Tower definitely enhanced our experience in the Historic Superior Suite. \\nWe felt confident to stay at One King West during COVID19 as they did a fantastic job of disinfecting all areas. We noticed staff spraying disinfectant in all the \\u201Cbusy\\u201D areas in and around the lobby. There was also a notice in our room informing us that the entire room has been disinfected. The staff at the lobby also followed protocol, there was a screening process and rules for following social distance within the hotel - this gave us peace of mind. \\nOverall, my boyfriend and I had a lovely time at One King West hotel. Would highly recommend staying here. Our experience was definitely a memorable one and we hope to be back in the future. Thank you to the team at One King West!",

We found The Teller\\u2019s Bar\\u002FRestaurant had delicious food and attentive service. \\nGreat location. Only a short walk from Union station. Would stay there again in a heartbeat",
            "Staying at One King really is being at the hotel to call home. I really like to notice small things that are indicative of a really well run service establishment. The aspect of One King that really stands out is the continuity of staff. The front desk, the service people, the people I deal with in bookings all have a remarkable degree of continuity. That tells me that One King is a good employer, the staff are genuinely happy to be there and in turn, this relays into a comfortable, welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. Oh, and the location if fantastic, right beside the subway and barely a 10 minute stroll to the Up Train from Pearson, the food and bar service are top notch and next door at the Daily Ritual serves up a delicious sandwich or wrap, soup, coffee or a perfect latte!

            "We stayed at One King West in April 2022 for a week after travelling from the UK.  This was our first family holiday with our son aged 4.  Stayed in one of the Historic Double Suites which had its own kitchenette which was everything we needed.  All staff were very friendly and helpful and at a time when covid guidelines still in force, these were adhered to within the hotel itself.  The hotel is in downtown Toronto and nearby Metro stations can be accessed easily from street level or the PATH system which the hotel has direct access to.  All the main attractions are within 5-15 minute walking distance via PATH or street level and this hotel would be a great location for someone willing to explore downtown.  We had an amazing stay and will look to use this as our place of stay the next time we visit Toronto",
            "I recently stayed at One King West, I surprised my partner with an overnight staycation for her birthday. Since it was a special occasion, and since it was my first stay at this hotel, my fingers were crossed that the experience would be good and go smoothly\\u2014but it far exceeded my expectations! \\n\\nI booked their romantic couples getaway package, which includes a cheese plate on arrival; a three-course dinner with a bottle of sparkling wine; and a breakfast. \\n\\nThe dinner in particular was unbelievably good. I'm not sure what I expected\\u2014I misheard the concierge, I thought I had to pick up the dinner from the lobby, and assumed it would be in takeout style boxes? Instead, we arrived to our room to find a formal table setting, and dinner was delivered straight to our room on a trolley, on gorgeous plates with cloches to keep everything warm. The quality and presentation of the food was excellent, the kind of fine dining I'd expect from a first class restaurant. I'd wanted to take her out to dinner for her birthday, but it wasn't possible because of pandemic restrictions\\u2014so this was the perfect alternative! \\n\\nThe room was clean, the view was stunning. The televisions were outfitted with Chromecast, so we were able to use our phones to watch movies via Crave, it was easy to set up. \\n\\nAt every step, the staff were super friendly, and went out of their way to communicate and ensure everything was going well. \\n\\nWe definitely plan to go back for another staycation in the not so distant future",
            "Although times feel like we are at a stand still, scary and worrisome, it\\u2019s amazing to see that we still have customer service agents going above and beyond to make guests feel welcome, safe and comfortable. My girlfriend and I visited one king west last weekend and I have to say that Sayara Ashory was an excellent example of unwavering service. From welcoming us, helping with current situation and making us feel comfortable and also showing great awareness by always cleaning hands and offering sanitizer. I\\u2019ve come to this hotel before and I\\u2019ve always enjoyed my time here but I have to say that this visit was special because the service got better at a time where some might be scared to speak to guest or offer usual service. Amazing visit and I will always remember sayara!",

Housekeeping staff are all so wonderful and helpful with anything you need. Junard and Andreas the bartender are super awesome and makes the best cocktails, they have a great selection and can literally make any drink you want. I went the next day to there coffee shop, it\\u2019s called Daily Ritual Cafe, truly felt like a European cafe with beautiful service, excellent coffee and croissant options, there barista Nicole and Jade were the sweetest, so kind and they make the best coffees. We are looking forward for our next trip",

The room was very spacious with a small living room and two televisions all in the same space. The bed was comfortable and bathroom adequate.\\nThere was two slit windows with no view whatsoever, so we had to keep the lights on during the day. Let\\u2019s say that we were not used to that and it was not mentioned in the description as we chose the junior suite.\\nThe kitchen was adequate but severely lacking in utensils for cooking breakfast, we had to request a toaster. We have been in several hotels with kitchenette and they were well equipped to at least have some eggs and toasts, along with condiments.\\nThere is a small shop downstairs with sandwiches and good coffee.\\nThe restaurant downstairs is good with casual fare and good service.all COVID protocol were respected. We liked the hotel overall and would probably return if we go back to Toronto",

Thank you, Ehrwan! \\n\\nOur rooms are clean and fresh when we come back after a day of activities with fresh towels and everything in order\\n\\nWe had a little hiccup on our first night as the air-conditioner was not as cool as we wanted it to be but they immediately sent their engineer\\u002Ftechnician to remedy the issue. \\n\\nThe hotel has their own valet parking. They are courteous, friendly and we felt that they will take good care of our vehicle. Special mention to Muhammed Nurachman for being such a delightful valet. Thank you! \\n\\nWe also enjoyed going to Daily Ritual Cafe to get our coffee and pastry. They have the sweetest ladies working there, always with a ready smile and they were wonderful! Thank you ladies for making us feel welcome! \\n\\nAnother must-try is their bar called Teller Bar. Food was good, too. We enjoyed the Butter Chicken and their Olives with the bread on the side. Yum!

The location is excellent, being attached to the underground shopping and services of the PATH.  \\nWhen one enters the OKW, you are treated as their priority; check-in was courteous, efficient and informative, ensuring our needs were being met to the fullest. \\nRooms are well appointed and clean, we had a one bedroom suite with a well equipped kitchenette on the 47th floor, beds extremely comfortable, all linens and duvet were spotlessly white.  The sitting area was spacious with a stunning view of the lake.

            "I've stayed at One King twice this year. I orginally booked because the price was reasonable and the location was great. After staying there in April I returned because I was so impressed with the hotel. It is very well kept and clean. Both of my rooms had great views of the CN tower and city.  The beds are comfortable, more on the firm side, which I prefer.  I bought food and used the kitchenette every day for breakfast. Front desk and the bell staff are courteous and attentive. I found all the staff, regardless of if they were helping me, to be exceptionally kind.  Whenever I was in the elevator with someone they would smile, greet me and strike up a conversation. The location is a short walk to the arena, train station, and there are so many great restaurants within minutes of the hotel. I loved going to the Daily Ritual Cafe (which is attached to the hotel)  in the morning, grabbing a coffee and walking around the corner to Berczy park to people watching.  Overall it's just solid hotel with great staff. I look forward to my next stay",
            "We had the pleasure of staying at One King West over this past weekend and once again it was amazing.  \\n\\nMy partner and I were invited for a corporate weekend getaway and from the moment we arrived at the hotel were were welcomed with warm hospitality.  The main lobby of the hotel has energy and invites you to sit, relax and enjoy a drink or two!  Our room was well appointed and spacious with incredible views of the CN Tower and the downtown core.  \\n\\nWe spent an evening enjoying a meal prepared by Chef Akshay and his team.  Everything from the seafood towers, Beef Tenderloin and Chocolate Ganache Dessert were to die for.  Every bite was like heaven.  The service was impeccable and there was not a detail missed.  The night air was unusually mild considering the time of year and we were able to enjoy the Toronto views from the terrace while sipping bubbly.   \\n\\nPlease be sure to visit The Daily Ritual when on site - incredible coffee, pastries and sandwiches.  I personally could not get enough of the coffee, I returned each afternoon as well.

            "My partner and I stayed here months ago when we needed a little reprieve, some quality time together and a little solitude. Months later, as busy as I am, I often think back to my time at One King West because our stay truly was excellent.\\n\\nThe facility is very lovely, and the staff, helpful. I want to make special mention of Front Desk Manager Shreyas Gore, who took the time and the effort to ensure that our stay was memorable. He was able to answer my questions and facilitate our requests, and periodically checked in with us in a way that was not too intrusive, rather it conveyed a sense of sincerity in making sure that everything was in order for our stay. I\\u2019m grateful that he greatly helped to make our time here extremely enjoyable and unique in all the best ways.\\n\\nThe room was lovely, the bed - very comfortable, the view overlooking the city was pleasant, and all facilities were clean and in good working order. I also found that the room was spacious, with an emphasis put on the flow to give the rooms themselves a uniqueness to them. I know this building is also a residence, but it\\u2019s one that truly lives up to its reputation of being a place of warmth, coziness and having good functional space.\\n\\nWe have since stayed elsewhere, including another prestigious location in Toronto, and were not able to get the same level of care, consideration, courtesy, attention and professionalism that we were provided here, all in addition to the benefit of experiencing this lovely hotel and residence with its rich history and charming aesthetic. I\\u2019m looking forward to our next stay here, as my partner and I are definitely making a repeat visit one of our life experiences in the future.\\n\\nUntil then, thanks to Shreyas, and thank you to the One King West team",
            "This hotel reminds me of Le Square Phillips H\\u00F4tel & Suites in Montreal! It is value priced but has luxurious touches, such as bathroom toiletries made by the amazing Canadian fragrance brand Byredo Bal d'Afrique. Wonderful scent!\\n\\n Unfortunately, the shower stall seal was a little open and the bathroom floor flooded. The carpeting in the room is a little worn.\\nWomen's dry sauna, men's dry sauna, and large coed hot tub (that easily fits 12 people) on the 17th floor were nice amenities, but the locker room itself was pretty abysmal. \\n\\nFront desk staff were excellent. Upon request, they put me in a tower king suite with a partial view of the lake, facing East. Unfortunately because the tower suites vary in size, I ended up with the smallest version, but it was fine for one person. I suspect if you have two people then this particular layout would be too small. The bathroom is tiny!\\n\\nIt was great to have a half-sized fridge, although the freezer was frosted over. The kitchen also has a large microwave, kettle, cutlery, plates, mugs, glassware, wine glasses, can opener, pot, pan, spatula, etc. There is however nowhere to eat. No dining table. So again, if you are just solo, you can eat at the desk. But if there are two people in a tower suite, then you cannot do in-room dining.\\n\\nThere are mirrors everywhere, including a very large full-length mirror near the front door and the world's best magnifying mirror in the bathroom. \\n\\nThe shower head has great pressure and can be changed to a different setting. The bed and bedding are quite comfortable, with feather pillows. There are two bedside tables with a telephone but no clock radio. There is also an armchair, ottoman, and tiny side table. For the life of me, I could not get the casting and streaming to work on the TV from my phone and there were no instructions in the room. I heard front desk mentione room service but there is no menu in the room either.\\n\\nI didn't end up eating or drinking anything in the hotel, and the tap water ran a little bit cloudy but was definitely drinkable. There is a water bottle fountain refill station in the fitness room on the 17th floor if you have your own container.\\n\\nBe sure to go to the basement level to see the vault and to the north side of the hotel to see the wedding venue staircase. It's an old bank, and the details are gorgeous and very photo worthy. Plenty of elevators, so there was never a very long wait. If you are taking TTC there, go up the escalator at the far left of the platform and you will exit right in front of the main entrance to the hotel. To take TTC from the hotel, exit North and you will see the stairs going down into the station immediately outside.\\n\\",
            "My husband and I took a night off from our broad of children and stayed at the One Hotel for the night. The room was not only renovated to perfection (minus the terrible shower systems which feels like you need Hulk strength to switch) but the mini bar, snack packs, amazing jersey house coats and slippers were magical. They are a sustainable hotel and as such only use recycled materials and we enjoyed their take on what else a shower cap could be used for. \\n\\nWe dined at the restaurant downstairs (which was also phenomenal) and had a drink on the roof top bar (amazing view of Toronto) We didn\\u2019t think the experience could get better but it did. The staff, especially the valet and front desk staff, were most courteous and always willing to help out with anything you needed. It was our one night out in 2 years without kids and we couldn\\u2019t of asked for anything better!!! \\n\\nThank you to the One Hotel for an amazing time and if you\\u2019re in doubt about staying here, no need. It will be everything you want and more. \\n\\nFYI the bed was soooooo comfortabl",
            "It was my Girlfriend's Birthday but Ontario went into complete lockdown yet again. so I booked a Tower Deluxe room and requested One King West to give us one of the best views from hotel room so that the lockdown does not come in the way of making her happy. To my surprise upon Check-In we were upgraded to Tower Premium for free. This was the best gesture from the management. I had one more request to sneak the amenity in our room with a card while we were out and they did it perfectly well. This surely made our day one of the most memorable ones.\\nAlso they took utmost care of COVID-19 rules and regulations.\\nIt was indeed one of the best stays with the best view of Downtown Toronto",
            "Had another amazing stay at the Hotel. The team here really goes out of there way to ensure that we have an excellent time, from valet, front desk, hskp to the bar staff are simply amazing and really make you feel like a million dollars and especially safe during these crazy times, excellent protocols in place, card in the room tells you exactly how they clean the room using which chemicals and electrostatics sprayers to keep us safe, no other hotel does that and we travel a lot.\\n\\nIt is always such a pleasure to come to Toronto and stay with One King West Hotel and Residence. Can\\u2019t wait for our next trip in Jan",
            "We were so delighted with our beautiful Suite at One King West. If you are not used to going to Downtown Toronto, it can be a very scary place to drive. The Valet Service took care of the Car and it was just a nice 12 minute walk to the Hospital.\\nWe had to stay for 1 day and a half and they offered us a great rate.\\nBecause of the Lockdown in Toronto, I brought our own food. We were so delighted to find a Mini Kitchenette in our room, and the views from the 36 th Floor were amazing!\\nThe Building is part new part Historic, the old TD and the fixtures were so Beautiful.\\nAnna at the Front Desk was great, but it is impossible to single out the Best Employee because everyone that we dealt with was amazing and genuinely concerned about making our short stay the best it could be under the circumstances. There is a Huge Vault down the Staricase in the Lobby, although closed to walk into at this time, you can see the Massive Door, and enter the Path right from the Lobby. Stores were closed and not many people around, but we really enjoyed walking and exploring underground. There were some Cafes open and take out food places, but not many.\\nA great location when having to stay in the City, we Highly recommend this Hotel and gladly give it 5 Stars for Comfort, Sleep, conveniences, excellent Staff, and everything about it",
            "Nice hotel right in the center of Toronto. \\nI took the train from Pearson Airport to Union Station and then walked to the hotel which took me less than 10 minutes. The room had a great view and was very comfortable although a bit noisy as I could hear people walking in the corridor. The staff at the reception was nice and friendly and room service quick and very attentive. Overall a great stay",
            "I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights over the weekend and definitely enjoyed the stay. I initially booked a suite that I found for a good discount compared to the prices standard rooms were going for around the area (which is well located downtown, literally a few steps from the subway and streetcar). However, when checking in they gave us a complimentary upgrade to a slightly bigger suite which I did not expect considering the discounted rate I already paid. So that was a nice bonus!\\n\\nWe ended up staying in the Tower Premium Suite (originally booked the Tower Deluxe) and the room was very clean, spacious with a little living area and floor to ceiling windows which made it very bright. We had a corner room so  had a great view of the lake and surrounding skyline. The bed was also big and very comfortable.  \\n\\nIf you had to twist my arm to find a negative, my only criticism which is a very minor, niche complaint is that there were no bathrobes provided in the room which I do tend to use when visiting hotels. I'm sure if I asked for them they may have been provided which I just didn't bother to do myself (they do send you a text when checked in to welcome you and reply with any requests you have), but it would be nice if they were there already considering it was a suite. Again it wasn't a big deal, but sometimes the smaller things can make the difference. Overall, it was a great stay and would certainly recommend it",
            "Our stay here was incredible. I was able to stay at one king west in November for a little escape. It was a great couples experience and the guest services was incredible. I was greeted at the from door by Muhammed, one of the concierge\\u002Fvalet staff. He was very thorough and helpful about how to check in and provided me general instructions on the covid guidelines in the hotel. He also recommended me places to eat including the tellers bar in the hotel that I decided to try and am very happy I did. The truffle fries are to die for. At the front desk I had an interaction with Joana and Justine who helped me with the check in process and were able to upgrade my room with late check out. This was five star service. The hotel room itself had a spectacular view and their sanitation practices made me feel very safe with the current COVID climate. I would highly recommend this hotel based on my experience. I will be coming here again",
            "We stayed again at this hotel as a result of our exemplary previous experiences and they outdid themselves again. \\nThis is by far one of the best things about One King West, consistently great customer service. \\nThe staff are very knowledgeable, prompt and courteous from checkin to checkout. \\nThe rooms are well appointed and very clean, always. \\nThe location is perfect for any excursions in the downtown core and we will not bother staying anywhere else. In fact, we\\u2019re heading back in February. \\nThe restaurant and bar are an added bonus if you don\\u2019t want to venture too far. \\nThe valet service upon arrival and departure are very prompt and there is always a staff member readily available for whatever you may need. \\nBeyond the location and the quality accommodations the staff are really what makes the difference. You always feel welcome. \\",
            "My daughter recently visited Toronto for a simple medical procedure.  Covid meant she needed to travel alone.  We requested a late checkout and then extended the checkout further so she could relax and recover.  The front desk staff accommodated all our requests without question and were very empathetic in their integrations with my daughter.  Exceptional!  Thank yo",
            "I recently had a staycation in a Historic studio suite and I had my misgivings because I encountered a dreary studio in the past (although front desk did give me an upgrade on request). This one, however, was a nice little suite and I really enjoyed my stay. The carpeting on the 14th floor hallways desperately needs  upgrading but that's my only complaint. Aside from running water I didn't hear a peep from my neighbors. What is really awesome about One King West is the customer service. Everybody from reservations, to front desk to the maids and maintenance staff sing from the same customer-pleasing hymn book. Toronto isn't exactly known for it's exceptional customer service, but I could find no fault with these people. Highly recommended, although I would suggest splurging for the Tower",
            "We overnighted in One King West to take in a show in Toronto's theatre district.  On arrival, we went through a quick but thorough Covid screening process, were greeted warmly by front desk staff and were soon on our way.  Our room was large, well appointed and very clean.  The theatre was a short subway ride away, and we came back for an enjoyable nightcap with friends in the ground floor bar.  We were impressed at the friendliness of every staff member that we met.  They invariably smiled and greeted us, offering help if needed.  We came away with the impression that this is a very well managed hotel that sets and maintains high standards in everything they do",
            "Needed to stay in downtown Toronto for one night and chose One King West based on its convenient location.  From the time I made my same-day reservation all the way through check-in and check-out I was impressed.  It's always nice to see a historic building preserved and they have done a great job.  It's a beautiful building.  My hotel room was on the 40th floor and i had a spectacular view of Lake Ontario.  My room was equipped with a small kitchenette should I have been interested in preparing small meals.  No complaints about the room.  It was perfect",
            "I truly don\\u2019t know where to begin. The title speaks for itself. One King West is truly a gem and the most prestigious hotel Toronto has to hold. Located on the intersection of Yonge and King. The view of the city from this hotel is remarkable and unobstructed one that is quite rare in Downtown Toronto. A photographer\\u2019s like myself heaven. This was the 3rd time staying at this hotel. Time and time again the team at One King West truly impresses and goes over and beyond. From the excellent guest service starting from the entrance Mo and Franz from the valet gave quite the friendly, outgoing, helpful assistance. To Anu at guest service providing a seamless and stress free check in experience. Along with the top of the line Covid screening and cleaning standards to make the guest more reassured about the safety of the hotel. Will definitely rebook and stay again",
            "I spent a weekend in Toronto and One King West was the best fit. \\nIt is conveniently located being equidistant from the harbour and one the biggest malls within a walkable distance\\nI would like to specifically thank Ana at the front desk for the warm hospitality. The check-in was seamless and rooms were absolutely clean with a spectacular view of the city and the CN tower\\nThe Smoked Old fashioned signature drink at the bar in the lobby is just what you would need to get your everything started!!\\nIt was an amazing stay at the beautiful property and I can\\u2019t wait to be back \\nThank you One King West team for a comfortable and memorable stay:",
            "We live in Toronto but wanted a quick and relaxing staycation in the city and our stay at One King West provided that exactly! Very friendly and helpful staff and well-managed from a COVID perspective as well. The location was perfect for us as we could walk to all of our favorite restaurants and coffee shops in the city. That said, the lounge in the hotel has an great vibe in the evenings if you want to have a drink or grab a bite to eat. The rooms were in pristine condition and the view from our suite in particular was spectacular. We had a 360 degree view from our suite right from the living room, bedroom to even the lavish bathtub in the bathroom. Overall, it was fantastic stay and we would love to visit again",
            "My wife and I came to Toronto for a quick overnight trip and booked One King West Hotel & Residence the day of.  The staff were all very nice, pleasant and helpful.  We had an amazing suite on one of the upper floors.  The views were outstanding!\\nOur suite was very clean and well appointed.  \\nThe water pressure in the shower was very good and the bed was one of the  most comfortable we've experienced in our travels.\\nI would definitely consider this hotel for our next trip to Toronto",
            "Great location \\uD83D\\uDC4D\\uD83C\\uDFFBOne King West Hotel & Residence is in Downtown Toronto neighborhood and is connected to a shopping center.

            "Booked this stay for one night as we were celebrating our anniversary to watch the Maple Leafs game and wanted to be within walking distance from the venue and have a place we could relax afterwards.\\nVery much wish we could have stayed fore more than one night as the staff and everyone was so accommodating.\\nUpon entering at the side street we were greeted by the valet team (Wonde & Muhammed), they asked us if we need aid with our luggage, we didn't, then proceeded to take care of our vehicle. *If you're from out of town coming in for a game and want to stay for a night I would suggest here as it is worth it for the protected parking garage and walking distance.\\nEntering the lobby I was greeted and assisted by Colin who checked us in and gave us an rundown of when the lobby bar closes etc, and we got free pastries\\u002F coffee vouchers at check in to use at the cafe connected to the hotel, lovely!\\nIf you are claustrophobic or are extremely impatient you \\\"might\\\" have a problem with waiting in an elevator to go to your room IF you are in a higher up room. But the views of the city scape are worth it. \\nAll the rooms are suites, the one we had was in a corner and was basically all windows and the sunset before the game was amazing. The bed was so comfy I didn't want to leave. You can order food from the TV. We came back from the Leafs game and watched tv and just sat in bed with the Toronto city lights surrounding us watching late night sports and eating food ordered from the TV drinking.\\nPEAK comfortable romance. \\nThe next morning we woke up and had free coffee and pastries it was so nice.\\n\\nUpon checkout Ana was really sweet and emailed out receipt to us as I didn't want any paper. It only took like 2 minutes to check out and leave. Amazing.\\nI had forgotten to call ahead to have Valet get my car ready as you should call 15 minutes early but the valet staff were really nice about it and found my car.\\n\\nWish I could go back soon. Too bad I live far",
            "Our hotel experience was as typical as most midrange hotels in Toronto - very  clean and large with many accomodations as well as valet service for parking.\\n\\nLocation was also great because it was within walking distance to most locations in Toronto, and anything else could be easily accessed via the public transit systems available.\\n\\nThe standout was definitely Mathew the door man, who greeted me and my friends with a large smile everytime. He was always there asking if we needed anything, always telling us to have a safe night and joking with us the entire stay. 100% a highlight.\\n\\nMathew if you're reading this thank you so much, and I look forward to fistbumping you again",
            "I live in Toronto, but I decided to spend three nights at One King just to get out of my apartment. I chose a room in the historical part of building, but was upgraded to a 32nd floor tower room on arrival. Considering the circumstances, I felt very safe at the front desk and with all the precautions that the hotel implemented, such as no room service or maintenance during my stay. The room was clean, had very large windows overlooking the city, and was well-equipped with a cooktop, microwave, dishwasher, coffee maker with coffee and tea, and various utensils, cups, glasses and plates. The WiFi was very reliable, and the king-size bed was perfectly comfortable. There was a shower stall in the washroom, which I prefer to a bathtub, so it was perfect for me. There is a restaurant that provides takeout; you can order and pick up your food downstairs. However, I chose to use some of the many interesting restaurants within walking distance that I was familiar with and where you can order takeout online and just drop by to pick it up: Richmond Station, Kupfert & Kim, Sukhothai, and Terroni. You can also get snacks at the Shoppers Drug Mart across the street. One King gave me a welcome respite from my usual locked down life. I highly recommend it to fellow Ontarians and Torontonians, especially now, when rates are considerably more reasonable than usual",
            "Came here late at night after having a horrible time with another place that was extremely sketchy. Had absolutely amazing service from all the employees who went out of their way to help give us a comfortable stay, and did their best to tell us all the best spots to check out and enjoy. Room service was on time and was so good to enjoy with the amazing view of Toronto that we had. Amazing location downtown with easy access to subway, streetcars and many great food places and shops nearby to explore. Another great thing about the location was that is was an easy drive to the gardiner expressway so there wasn\\u2019t any difficult downtown driving to do. All in all it was an amazing experience that went above and beyond my expectations from the service and food to location and the views. Super excited to visit again next time i come to stay in Toronto",
            "I would and do recommend One King West Hotel to anyone who asks. The service is exceptional the facilities are beautiful the rooms have more than you need with a kitchen that allows you to bring in your own food all utensils even a dishwasher. The beds will make you feel like your sleeping on a cloud. The staff goes above and beyond to make your stay perfect. I have stayed here many times this last was when my dad was flown to Toronto for surgery and they made me feel like I was at home. Oh and don\\u2019t forget to sit at the bar or enjoy the food from their restaurant",
            "We had an unplanned two night stopover in Toronto due to weather, and booked this property at very short notice.  It turned out to be one of the standout accommodation houses if our vacation.\\n\\nThe room was spacious, well appointed,  clean, modern and quiet. The location is right in the heart of the financial district, easy walking to everything and it has its own PATH entry as a bonus. To top it off, the staff are on top of their game too.\\n\\nThanks",
            "I stayed two nights for my daughter's wedding. The staff here are warm and friendly and always helpful. Right from check-in to check-out, the staff were always smiling and acknowledge me and give me any assistance I need. If you're planning a function, the organizational staff, the Chef and all the catering staff and the facilities are second to none. I was so impressed with the quality of the food and the service we received was first class. If you're just planning a visit to Toronto or a weekend getaway, you will love the suites. They are so beautifully appointed that you won't want to leave. They have million dollar views and having a kitchen right there in your room makes life so much more convenient. Then there's the BED!!! I have never experienced a big, soft, comfy bed like this in my life. I really wanted to take the bed home with me. This place is close to everything, has beautiful facilities and the entire staff from the porter right up to the Manager are helpful and welcoming in every way. I would not hesitate to recommend One King West to all of my friends and family. You won't be disappointed",
            "Spent anniversary here and the service was excellent. The valet was top notch (shoutout to Allen Rimpola) and the hotel overall was incredibly accommodating (thx Sally). The pricing was very reasonable and the location is remarkably convenient to many attractions Toronto has to offer. Will be back",
            "Stayed here for 4 nights in June for my 2nd visit to Toronto.\\n\\nReception staff were excellent, not only was I allowed to check in 2 hours early, I was also given a free upgrade to a Tower Suite. \\nRoom was large, clean and had a great view of the Lake and City. \\nThe location is perfect for exploring the city, walking distance to so many attractions. \\nMy security deposit was also released immediately meaning the money was there to spend before I left Canada. \\n\\nDefinitely will be staying here on my next visit",
            "Highly recommended when in Toronto . Well located downtown you can walk to everywhere. Rooms were clean with a kitchenette (we had a tower suite on the 39th floor) we even asked for a toaster. The bed and pillows\\u002F sheet were very very comfortable. The bathroom is a bit small compared to the big room but we didnt care. The only downside is that the valet parking is very expensive but we found \\u00E0 parking nearby which was less expensive. We will be back next time with no h\\u00E9sitation",
            "One king West Hotel is hands down the best property in the city of Toronto. They treat you like royalty every time we have come back, remember your names, preferences, they anticipate your needs even before one has to ask for it. My wife and myself have always thoroughly enjoyed our stay, beautiful rooms with great view, excellent Covid-19 protocols and policies in place, social distance properly maintained and mask policy is enforced. They also leave a card in the suite that tells you exactly the safe chemicals they used for electrostatic spraying. Front desk, valet staff are outstanding. It\\u2019s really a one stop shop for a great staycation. Food is amazing as well, One king west burger is to die for, great selection of wines at discounted prices. Thank you One King West and we can\\u2019t wait to come back again",
            "The suite I stayed in was wonderful. I enjoyed having so much space to move around, along with the separate sleeping area. I was amazed with all the extra accomodations in the room, including the washer and dryer, dishwasher, and stove. Despite having such a large room, it was very clean and the housekeeping staff did a tremendous job during my stay. I also liked that the room was not too noisy, even with the hotel being right on the corner of Yonge and King in the heart of Downtown Toronto. The location is perfect and easy to get around the city by TTC (the streetcar and subway stop right by the hotel, and Union Station is only a short distance away), or by foot (the PATH is also adjacent to the hotel). Teller's Bar and Bistro and the adjacent Daily Ritual Cafe serve great food, and the staff was always friendly and helpful",
            "From the Reception to the maids, all I received was professional kindness. The Downtown location made it easy for me to walk to the Bay area and experience all that downtown Toronto has to offer. The amenities in the room were astounding - washers, dryers and 2 TVs! The bed was extremely comfortable and I loved being able to use the sauna and hot tub. It reminded me of being on a cruise ship! Being solo, I didn't really need to be dining fancy, so was very happy that both Starbucks and Hero Hamburgers were across the street and I could eat happily in my room on the crockery and cutlery provided. The coffee provided in the room was just okay but better than most",
            "The hotel was conveniently located downtown Toronto, the room were spacious with very soft bedding. In particular, our concierge, Dakshay, who checked us in, was outstanding. He was very professional, warm and even gave us complimentary late check out as we were celebrating an anniversary"
