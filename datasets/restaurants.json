            "How this restaurant got to number two in Toronto I have no idea. Perhaps it was good once but not any more. Five of us had made a reservation for 8pm. Firstly there were no parking places anywhere near the restaurant. Secondly they were not checking anybody's covid vaccination certificates to eat in the restaurant. \\nOur table was not ready so we had to wait over half an hour to get seated, then a further half an hour to get water and menus. We ordered the coconut shrimp and the crab cakes as starters, these took another 30 minutes to arrive. The shrimp were good but the crab cakes were mushy and tasted funny. Our main courses took another 30 minutes to arrive. By this time it was after 10pm. Three of us ordered filet steak, one rare and the other two medium rare, well when they arrived the steaks were all well done. We complained to the owner but all he said was \\\"sorry\\\", pretty bad for a supposed steak house. Dozens of other steak houses in Toronto are much better. They have a new tent out front so they can seat more diners, but with only three wait staff they are really falling short. We will never be returning to this restaurant.\"",

            "A friend took us here as she had previously enjoyed a meal here. We ordered the calamari appetizer, very tasty. Our table had jambalaya for 2, seafood pasta and the tenderloin steak. The food was phenomenal! I am not the biggest fan of spicy food ( prefer flavour to heat) my pasta sauce was modified with a little cream added to the creole sauce. It was the best seafood pasta I\\u2019ve ever had. The shrimp was tender and tasty, the fish too was very flakey and tender.  My son loved his steak and the jambalaya was  impressive in both flavour and size. Beignets and pecan pie rounded out the dining experience. Decor is very quaint with musical instruments on the walls and framed pictures. Restaurant was very busy with all the tables occupied. If I had to say where they could improve it would be in 2 things. 1)Another server\\u002Fbusser to fill our water glasses, take away plates and package up any leftovers for us to take home. We weren\\u2019t able to finish the jambalaya and it was taken away, we assumed it would be packaged up for us to enjoy tomorrow, but it wasn\\u2019t. What a waste. 2)Invest in a nespresso or keurig. Only option for coffee was expresso or latte. The option of having a nice decaf coffee or tea with dessert would have made the impossibly long wait for our bill a bit more tolerable. The wrap up of the evening was less than impressive.\"",

He does not miss a table and bestows upon each one an individual attention that seems almost impossible for one man to accomplish in a many-tabled room.  \\nWhen Mike stops at your table, he leaves you with the feeling that you are the only one he has ever had the pleasure to feed.  \\nHis brown eyes have a mischievous twinkle above a ready smile that is inviting and genuinely warm.  His conversation is comfortable and friendly and sneaky.  In our one-on-one time with him he learned I was visiting Ontario from Calgary and my girlfriend and I were celebrating our June birthdays.  Mine had been the 24th and Joanne's was that day.  \\nHave I mentioned the food?  \\nThe FIVE STAR, amazing food!  Beautifully presented and spiced with a deft and knowing hand in true cajun tradition.  My girlfriend had the salmon and I had the lamb chops!  Portions were more than generous and neither of us were able to clean our plates which meant another delicious meal was to be had from our leftovers.\\nI want to say how tender and flavourful the lamb chops were; only the fresh, seared al dente vegetables seriously threatened to show them up.\\nOf course we shared so I got to taste the melt-in-your-mouth, perfectly grilled, salmon that gave me a jolt of pure Pelican envy, wishing for a beak that could hold more than my belly can!   \\nBeing much too full to think of ordering dessert we basked in the last of our wines chosen from a broad cellar selection and chatted.  Even though it was still early in the evening and the dining room was full, we felt no pressure to get up and leave.\\nMike arrived again at our table and said they would like to give us complimentary birthday desserts and to please take our choice from the menu.  \\nSurprised, we both chose the creme caramel which was served on a large dinner plate with a big HAPPY BIRTHDAY written in chocolate and with a lit candle!  Even though we were bursting at the seams we both managed to find room to scrape the last bite of eggy caramel goodness, with a touch of semi-sweet chocolate bark, making it a piece de resistance.\\nNow drowning in our decadent fullness we were served with one more surprise in a small, fluted aperitif.  \\nAt first taste we thought Sambuca, but the taste was too smooth so we asked one of the waiters and found it was a delightful mix of frangelico and white creme de menthe.  Mmmmmm.\\nAnd there you have it!  \\nThe cat is out of the bag! \\nNew Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse is the place to go for your best dining experience ever!\"",

The mains were terrific, three of us had the delicious, melt in your mouth Chilean Sea Bass which was reasonably priced to boot! Our youngest likes steak and he had the blackened strip loin with green peppercorn sauce. The steak was tender and better than the steak he had at Hy's downtown earlier this year.

Everyone at the table tried it and loved it. \\n\\nOne small criticism from a friend was that the smoked trout could have been better (but was not bad) but the corn pur\\u00E9e that came with it was really amazing.\\n\\nThe waitress was super nice and very accommodating and she made sure we got out of there on time for our play\\u002Fmusical. So thank you for the great service!\\n\\nIt was a quick meal as we were rushing to the theatre but everyone enjoyed it. I would definitely go back.\\n\\n\"",
            "This place is one to go to in Toronto. It is a tad on the expensive side but is worth it.\\nI went with a friend, we started with the Korean cauliflower which was great. Large cauliflower pieces, deep friend with a perfectly crispy coating. I could've gone with a little more sauce but the flavour of the sauce is great so I think thats just a personal thing. \\nWe did wait about 20 minutes for our appetiser so our server gave us blistered shishitos for the wait. This was a nice addition to our meal.\\nFor the main course, I got the burger which was FANTASTIC. I have had many house ground burgers but this place has a great ratio of fat to protien which allowed for a juicy burger. I was impressed by the construction of the burger as a whole. From the bun to the cheese, to the size of the patty it was so great. \\nMy friend got the beans and rice which is a vegetarian meal and it was also delicious. Its wonderful to have a smokehouse that also provides great vegetarian options.\\n\\nI would totally recommend going to this restaurant.\"",
            "Just got back to hotel after meeting my best bud and his wife for dinner. We had an incredible experience at The Carbon Bar with outstanding service from Lisa, fabulous BBQ platter in which the ribs, brisket and buttermilk fried chicken were all outstanding. I started with a Smoked Manhattan cocktail which was unique and delicious. At the end of the meal, make sure you ask for the bourbon cart to come to your table. Ivan (aka Santa) will dazzle you with his knowledge and charm and their selection is impressive. Maybe the best restaurant experience I\\u2019ve ever had in Toronto!\"",

            "My husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner and was quite disappointed in the food.  We weren't able to get the seafood platter since we went on a Sunday so we went with the meat platter and a plate of korean style cauliflower.  We also order 2 glasses of wine each.  The cauliflower was quite spicy and filling so when the platter came, we felt kinda full already!  The platter had alot of meat, 2 pieces of fried chicken and fries.  The meat quality was ok and the taste was average - nothing special.  We ended up packing up the meat and taking it home.  The whole meal came to $120 pre tax.  Not worth it and probably won't be returning even though the restaurant itself has a pretty cool vibe.\"",

            "1 word - AMAZING\\n\\nOVERALL:\\nThis place needs to be on everyone's bucket-list. The Carbon Bar is a sophisticated and grand environment, which features an upscale yet rustic atmosphere, delivers succulent, melt-in-your-mouth meats, creative and well-rounded appetizers, and an inspired bar menu! We can't wait to return!\\n\\nWe dined as a couple on Saturday, March 31st for dinner. Our 1st time here.\\nWe were a little early for our 7:45 reservation but our table was ready when we arrived and we were seated quickly.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE:\\nBeautiful! This restaurant has sky-high ceilings, rustic brick walls, and is very spacious. Every table was full during our dinner, but we did not feel crowded. The colour scheme of white brick, black, and red adds a nice contemporary vibe. The dim lighting was a nice romantic touch, but the lighter colours in the restaurant like the walls opens the place up enough that it doesn't seem dim at all in there. The restaurant has a large bar on the North side, and an open kitchen that you can see into on the South side. Booth tables fill the main dining area. We were very comfortable, and just loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nGreat service! Our waitress was knowledgeable, attentive, friendly, and enthusiastic! I wish I could remember her name. She was blonde with a great smile.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nHand's down the BEST meat I have ever eaten. \\n\\nAPPETIZERS: We had the K.F.C (Korean Fried Cauliflower) and the Duck Tacos. I never knew Cauliflower had the potential to showcase so many textures in one bite!  When you pop one of those in your mouth, the first thing you get is a crispy, succulent burst from the cauliflower florets. Deeper into the bite, the cauliflower develops into a tender, and juicy mouthful. It is seasoned with a sweet and spicy Korean-style sauce, reminiscent of eating a crispy chicken wing, except it's a piece of cauliflower. And, while the sauce is absolutely delicious, the star of the dish is the vegetable itself. Cooked to absolute perfection. A MUST TRY.\\nThe DUCK TACOS were also fabulous! Served as a pair, a large piece of duck meat is placed on an orange coloured anchiote tortilla -- a tender soft tortilla shell, accompanied by a dollop of creamy sweet pineapple salsa, savory smooth guacamole, and finished off by the refreshing acidity of pickled red onions and a splash of lime juice. These tacos are a symphony in your mouth. The flavors are vibrant. These tacos are the epitome of \\\"finesse\\\".\\n\\nMAIN:\\nTHE PITMASTER PLATTER -- Features tender, melt in your mouth brisket, fall of the bone pork side ribs, and crunchy, moist fried chicken. On the side are dill pickles, crispy fries, and a selection of dipping sauces. The brisket was the star of this platter for us. The bark was savory, salty, and bursting with flavor. Charred to perfected, and buttery to taste. It literally melted in your mouth. This was the best meat I have ever eaten. The pork ribs were delicious! They slid off the bone, were not as fatty as side ribs tend to be, and were seasoned to perfection. The fried chicken was an after thought to us because we were mostly there for the barbecued items. However, it was really yummy! The chicken was moist and tender, and the buttermilk crust was light, although it was thickly coasted. This platter is also a very generous serving. We couldn't finish it all, but The Carbon Bar offers to-go service and we were able to enjoy leftovers the next day! \\n\\nALCOHOL:\\nWe ordered the \\\"Black Mamba Margarita\\\" which was made with charcoal infused tequila, and was black in colour. These were dangerously good! I recommend these!\\nThey also have a Bourbon Cart that they roll to your table, which probably features over 100 bottles of bourbon selections. I can't recall what we ordered, but they had a bourbon sommelier help us choose something from the cart and we really enjoyed his recommendation! \\n\\nDESSERT:\\nSo we were here to celebrate my SO's birthday. We ordered 2 bourbon chocolate ganache skulls.. mini chocolates in the shape of literal skulls, coloured gold. These were a nice treat. They also brought out their DEATH BY CHOCOLATE dessert, complete with a sparkler in celebration! Consisting of a chocolate mousse cake, caramelized white chocolate ice cream, hazelnut crumple, and a crunchy toffee tuile. This thing was decadent! The mousse was not your typical kind..  it was layered on top of a white chocolate and hazelnut ganache which added depth to the chocolate dessert. The mousse cake eaten together with the ice cream and the hazelnut crumble rounds out each bite and really provides depth of flavour to the dessert. A MUST TRY!\"",
            "The atmosphere was upscale and modern. My friend and I went for an early light dinner and both ordered the duck tacos. They were kind of expensive for my budget for two tacos at $18 CAD, but I wasn't that hungry and they were so delicious that they were worth every penny. The service was great, and I will definitely go back the next time I am in Toronto.\"",
            "Have had dinner here a couple times now. The servers are super friendly and the atmosphere was relaxed and comfortable. By far the brisket is the best! Tried the sample platter on our first visit and decided brisket is the way to go!  The K.F.C bits are the best app as well. Have never left hungry! Great place to eat!\"",
            "This is THE place to go for my co-workers and I after work for drinks.  \\n\\nThe bar is fantastic with great wine options and crazy good good Bourbon cart if that is your thing.   This place offers a ton of great smoked food.   Every time we sit at the bar they give us a complimentary snack which we really appreciate.   \\n\\nThis is easily the nicest bar\\u002Frestaurant in the area.  Nothing else even in its league.\"",
            "We've been here twice. Same great service. Same great food. My bf was disappointed the Mac and Cheese was off the menu but we tried the croc bites. They were amazing!! Very similar to calamari. I wish it came with more dip though. \\n Friendly staff. Beautiful restaurant. Excellent service. \\nWe ordered the beat salad, KFC, the meat platter and the corn bread. \\nBest beat salad I've ever had. Not what I expected. Their KFC blew my cauliflower wings out of the water. Best I've had. Meat platter was delicious. My favourite was the chicken. Loved the pickles too. Mac and cheese was excellent. Corn bread was good. I'm not a corn bread fan but I did have a piece and enjoyed it. \\nI had the black margarita. It was strong. I liked it but one glass was enough for me. My boyfriend had the old fashioned. It was strong for me, but he loved it. My friend had the sangria and she raved about it. \\nWe all split a slice of cheesecake. It was so creamy and delicious. \\nThe bathrooms were really nice and clean. I honestly can't think of anything bad about this place. \\nWe will return.\"",
            "\\nEnjoyed a family dinner for five last night. Service was terrific. We ordered the Pitt Master platter for 2 and shared other items such as Duck Tacos, Ceviche, and the absolutely terrific K.F.C. (Korean Fried Cauliflower). Thank goodness we ordered 2 KFC! Could have eaten that dish all night long.\\nThe meat on the platter was delicious with every bite. Sauces were perfectly complementary.The only dish not appreciated was the side: slaw. It really wasn\\u2019t good.\\nWe found it to be expensive restaurant frequented mostly by 30-something\\u2019s. A couple of cocktails and beer, no wine or dessert, $55 tip, and the total was $355?.\\nWould like to return, but will have to save up the denaros. \"",

And take the lead.  Oh my, I used the knife out of habit, it wasn't necessary the brisket was so tender.  The taste is as described and almost overwhelming. Almost. It's a meat dish for meat lovers!\\nPrice was reasonable for Toronto but with top notch service and ambiance, it was worth every penny...can we say that anymore?  Worth every nickel!?\\nI told my daughter tonight, when she visits next, we're having dinner at Carbon. \"",

Overall a nice meal but I wasn't wowed by the main - would go back but maybe just order a selection of the mezze dishes as a main too. \"",

            "I had been to the Tabule location on Queen Street East, and liked it.  So i was wondering how that would translate to a quiet stretch of Yonge Street south of Eglinton.  Quite well, as a matter of fact.  We falafels to start...lamb kofta and veggie pepper plate ...all presented and spiced very well.  The place was almost packed, but we got decent service.

            "I was here with a friend and had to wait because we didn't make reservations on a Saturday night! It was packed but the servers and hostesses were extremely efficient. We were seated at the bar where we ordered the 3-combo appetizer of baba ganoush, hummus and tabule with pita. It was delicious, both flavourful and fresh; it came with a basket of pita as you would expect. The pita was good but not extraordinary. \\n\\nBefore we finished the appetizer, we had moved to a small table. It was difficult fitting everything on the table. We shared the European sea bass with rice and vegetables. Simply delicious! The sea bass was fresh, so lightly seasoned as it was - perfect! And the rice merits mention as well; perfectly done, more than just steamed, perhaps lightly stir fried with spices resulting in wonderful flavours. \\n\\nThe picture shown here is the sea bass we ordered but fully de-boned for us because we were sharing. I think that it is normally served whole. It was their catch of the day. \\n\\nNote that we were at the mid-town location at 2009 Yonge. Parking was a bit of a challenge being Saturday evening. There weren't any Green P lots nearby. There may be another location downtown. \"",

Great value for money and we will definately be back.  \\n\"",

I had come for a meeting and requested coffee which came immediately, hot and delicious. It was difficult to have a working lunch when the food kept taking over the conversation. The Lentil soup was supreme. My plate of grilled vegetables, salad and jeweled rice was tasty and fresh. I will be back for pleasure as well as business!\"",
            "Phone-in order due to COVID-19 - fantastic service there, and ended up making a few changes due to staff recco.\\n\\nWent for the set menu (Dinner for Four), adding the excellent arnabeet cauliflower and a bottle of wine, then placed the order through their online system (which is the  way they do CC's ).  That same system pings you when everything's ready.  I swung by in a few minutes, grabbed my baggies, no problems.\\n\\nOK so the hummus is just brilliant as usual.  Loads of WW pita for dipping.  So tasty.  Labni is in the bag too and this stuff is great on the kefta (lamb\\u002Fbeef) and tawuk (chicken) kebabs.  We always love the mujaddaru lentil rice - a meal in itself, just about.  \\n\\nThe one miss for me is that no desserts are on offer at the moment; I could not get the muhalbiya.\\n\\nAbout the wine:   who would have thought you'd order a bottle with your takeaway two months ago.  But this is a stellar idea.  Some restos have their suppliers drop off the usual offerings - familiar Aussie syrahs, inexpensive Italian rossos, VQA whites - plus a few surprises.  These are things you can't get in the general listings and worth exploring.  Last night the French pinot noir was an error and the recco instead was a 2017 Mark West.  Solid choice from a winery that does only pinot.  And while I usually 'whine' about markups, not this time.  Take-out wine means putting it in a brown paper bag.  No glassware to bring, take away, wash, dry, re-set; no sommelier time to offer lists, consider pairings, and make remarks; no opening, decanting, pouring and re-pouring... all this means the resto can drop some of that mark-up and offer choice to diners.   If this is the future, I'm all for it.\\n\\nExcellent.  Local.  Authentic.  Great service.\\n\\nSee you again - soon.\"",
            "This wouldn't be my usual choice of restaurant but it is busy for a reason.\\nThey had a few different dishes and even though I would normally order tomatoes the dish was great. It was like a chunk of tomato sauce.\\nHamas was great.\\nThe gluten free bread is better than the pita.\\nEverything was great and the waitress was really attentive.\\nNice show when pouring water!\\nThis is a really good choice when you're looking for informal dining.\"",

Unfortunately that restaurant wasn't open almost an hour after our reservation time. So we looked up somewhere else to go. And tabule on Yonge was 1 of 2 that came up.  As we walked in the place, it was noticeable very clean and bright.  We were asked if we had a reservation . It was also very busy. Anyway they accommodated us and from that moment it was the start of a wonderful experience. The staff were excellent, shout out to our server Ryan ! And apologizes to all the rest that helped us, for not asking your name. This is a place you will want to go back again and again. And I'm sure I will.

The quality of the food was very good and the portions large. It is recommended that you share the 3 choice cold platter or just enjoy it as a main course. The only problem , for us, was the level of noise. Possibly eating on the outside patio might help but it was hard to hear each other.\"",
            "Atmosphere is bustling and a bit tired looking. Service started off aggressive and needed to be addressed for a change of attitude, thereafter being toned down and more helpful. The vegetarian grilled vegetables on lentils \\u002Frice was very good, cold apps were good, Laffa  overpriced, and sausages caused vomiting later. No issues with chicken skewer, shrimp was found to be overdone. Timing of course delivery was erratic. \"",

The selections for appetizer (cauliflower and tahini - yum), main and dessert were varied and all three of us enjoyed.  The baklava was a little dryer than last time I ate here but tasty just the same. The main servings were a good portion size. Two of our party had a late lunch and took home leftovers.

            "We dined here with friends. While they ordered non-vegetarian dishes (Lamb Chops) and liked it a lot, we went to the vegetarian side and got the Fatoosh salad, Fried eggplant, Pickles, and I got an Espresso Martini to drink.\\n\\nThe food was filling and delicious, although it looked like they loaded the plate with more cucumber and tomatoes to visually fill it up. The espresso martini was ok. I have had it on Emirates and in other restaurants, so this wasn't close to them at all.\\n\\nWe then ended with the Panacotta which was perfect for 3-4 people to share since it is quite rich and heavy.\\n\\nWhile the drink didn't work out, the food is definitely worth another visit.\"",

Winterlicious in Toronto, leads to many restaurants offering a 3 course prix fixe. The appetizer sampler of baba ganouj, hummus and tabouleh is good and as advertised. The roasted egg plant main was only so-so. Similarly the kaftan was salty and overcooked. The game-y flavor of the lamb was really in full form. Dessert made with phyllo pastry was good.\"",

We had mango lassi to drink (always wonderful) but the kheer (rice pudding) for dessert was somewhat bland. \\n\\nThe service was also uneven. At first, everyone was attentive, but then, nobody came back to our table for a while, to see if we needed anything; and it even took a while to get someone's attention so we could have the check.  Over all, I was not sorry I went (as I said, some of the buffet items were nicely done), but I wondered if we should have asked to look at the full menu.

            "Great food.  Near the theatre as well.  Good choice.  Never had Indian food before so our 'friend' ordered to our delight.  Had to stay on the mild side so my insides wouldn't rebel.  Plan to return at my next trip to Toronto.  One of our group goes to this restaurant regularly and has fond memories with his wife.\"",
            "Great Service but mediocre food. We had a late dinner at Arome but unfortunately the chicken was very dry and not at all tasty. The vegetarian dish was very good \"",
            "We had an excellent meal and were served by friendly and attentive staff, who where particularly good at talking to our children.\\nI enjoyed a sizzling whole fish and the rest of the food was traditional Indian restaurant food with the spice levels individually requested.\\nThe decor as a previous reviewer said was a little tired but overall a thoroughly enjoyable meal.\"",
            "Aroma is a high quality Indian Restaurant, with a very pleasant and relaxing interior design. The food is delicious, plus the staff is very friendly and helpful. All dishes are made to order, and an individual's dietary needs are almost always accommodated. Weekends tend to be extremely busy at this restaurant. In order to avoid the crowds, a weekday visit would be a much better experience for slow and leisurely dining.\"",
            "I was with a group of ten people all heading to the theatre after lunch. This restaurant was chosen due to location, price and of course the variety of dishes. I am not an expert in any way on Indian food so my review will only touch base to my overall feelings.\\nThe exterior of the building has a \\\"SIGN\\\" that can not be missed especially when standing outside the theatre. Therefore with such an advertisement behind the doors should be quite the experience. You do need to walk up a flight of steps so for anyone with walking challenges this is not a restaurant for you. Also to go to the washroom there is another flight of steps.\\nThe food is made on the premises since that was what I understood. Each table had white linen tablecloths with napkins to match. There were three areas you can choose food from. One had lettuce, yogurt and other choices. The dessert area had kofta and then a few different flavours of ice cream. The main buffet had a lentil soup, naan bread\\nButter chicken, samosas, tandoori, basmati rice with peas,vindaloo, Bharta (eggplant)\\nThere were other dishes one being goat. All the ones I chose seemed cooked just right with just the correct amount of spice for my taste.\\nI did check their menu online and saw they have eleven different Tandoor Specialties, eight chicken, eight meat curry and thirteen Vegetarian. After talking to the waiter it seemed that choices changed on the buffet which is a good thing for people who choose to eat there on a regular basis. Also it seemed that half the restaurant was filled with people from this country so it must be good!\\nThe waiter was friendly but service for beverages was slow as well as cleaning off the used dishes.. That was due to the place being packed and probably one more helper was needed. We ended up paying at the register $18 for the lunch buffet plus a tip.\\nAn overall consensus was we would definitely return.\\nThe only added idea I might suggest that they type out each dish they have with a short description of what it is, paste on recipe cards and laminate. Do two times for each dish  offered.  Keep in a container (box) in alphabetical order and then take out and put it on the retaining clips they use. Wouldn't this assist the customers greatly plus it assists with any food allergies. Also it would stop the need to print out as you go.\"",
            "I visited this place to try their lunch buffet on a weekday. First of all when we reached, the place was too crowded and we had to wait to get a seat. I would say that waiting there wasn\\u2019t worth at all. First of all, I believe they are overutilizing the place. All the tables and chairs are narrowly placed. Now, coming to the food. In Vegetarian, there were 2 appetizers (Samosa and Mix Veg Pakora), 5 Curries ( Gobi, Matar Paneer, Beans, Dal Makhani, Eggplant), Saffron Rice, Naan and 3 Desserts (Kheer, Gulab Jamun & Ice Creams). Apart from Dal Makhani, nothing stood out for me. Everything tasted average or below than average. The curries lacked flavors and spices. They all tasted very bland. The only thing that is good is you can try multiple options at a decent rate.\"",
            "There were quite a few choices in the buffet, which includes salad and dessert. For those who are spice-averse, nothing was terribly spicy...for those who like spice, you may find it on the bland side. Staff was not terribly friendly but were not rude. Note: this location is NOT accessibility friendly in any way.\"",
            "Some of the best Indian food I have ever had. Anywhere. Friendly staff, wonderful easy ambiance. Delicious food. All round winner!\"",
            "This was an excellent buffet. Everything was so flavorful. We thoroughly enjoyed all the vegetarian options and the mango smoothie was amazing!\"",
            "Mixed Vegetable Pakora, Chicken Lababdar, Beef Rogan Josh, Garlic Naan\\n Bread with fresh garlic baked in clay oven... Enjoyed an incredible meal last night with my beautiful daughter in Toronto for the weekend.  A huge Thank YOU to our amazing server Peter for his recommendation.   Definitely will come back next visit.\"",
            "We have not been here for a while but on a recent Sunday before going to a theatre matinee almost across the street, we decided to retry this place.\\n\\nStill white table cloths, good service and lots of buffet selections even for vegetarians. Items are varied and tasty and you can either eat quickly or take as much time as you want. Having a filling sit-down lunch for under $20 each is getting harder to find in downtown Toronto.\\n\\nAbout the only negative is that it\\u2019s on the second floor with no elevator (that we could see) and the restrooms are one more flight up!! So, if you\\u2019re mobility impaired, this place is not for you.\"",
            "Stopped in for the lunch buffet on a Saturday afternoon. The place was busy but not crowded and got a seat right away. The buffet was superb and I'm a pescatarian. Plenty of vegetarian choices and even a fish choice which is not something you see often at an Indian Buffet. Waiters were very attentive, the food was hot and fresh. Definitely recommend it.\"",
            "We have eaten at a variety of Indian restaurants across Ontario and this is one of the best. The menu has a good variety of vegetarian entrees and the curries we chose were outstanding. The service was attentive and the food presentation was photo-worthy. Prices are very reasonable. \"",
            "Popped in before a show. Great selection of vegetarian items. Nice atmosphere with a view of Roy Thomson Hall.\"",
            "Good casual spot for Indian Food. Close to theatre area on King. Luv the vegetarian dishes such as Saag, eggplant and Dal\"",
            "First time at this restaurant. We wanted a quick lunch before the theatre and love Indian food. Lunch buffet had a huge selection of dishes. Chicken, beef, goat, fish, and lots of vegetarian options. So much choice it was hard to eat light. In our group we had one who is a strict vegetarian and another with a dairy allergy. Both had lots of options to choose from. Our waiter had to check with the kitchen regarding dairy - for dishes that had been marinated with yogurt, fried in butter - which he did and came back a couple of times during the meal with updates. The restaurant started to fill quickly and serving staff were very busy getting everyone settled so his efforts were much appreciated. Wish we lived closer because we could easily become regulars. \"",
            "The food and service were amazing. We had vegetarian and meat options which everyone loved. It was all so delicious and we had so much food! Thank you for accommodating our event start time and arranging delivery. I highly recommend and we\\u2019ll definitely eat at Aroma restaurant again whether eat in or take out.\"",
            "Aroma is the only restaurant my family visited more than once while on a week's vacation in Toronto. Plenty of other very good options, but this offered something great for everyone. From vegetarian and even vegan options to a Prawns Vindaloo for me with a hot sauce that rocked my world. Friendly, attentive staff helped make the experience enjoyable.\""

My salmon tartare was wonderful. Subtle hints of disparate but distinct flavours emerged with each new bite. My albacore tuna...perfectly cooked, and accompanied with interesting vegetables and a lovely delicated sauce. The suggested white wine from Pelham...beautiful. The lemon tart?

            "The restaurant offers a great view of the city if you manage to get the right table but apart from that, there isn't a lot that is special about it. The menu is limited which typically isn't a problem if the food is flavourful. In this case, the food was quite tasteless - we ordered several dishes across all courses - and remained disappointed throughout. The portions also are small and the service is less than satisfactory. Our server for one could barely manage to smile throughout the 2 hours we were there. When you take all that in and look at the steep prices, it just doesn't seem worth it. \"",

            "Used restaurant as first stop on a life time holiday to canada.\\n\\nWhilst the views and experience of rotating are secind to none, the food and staff are the opposite\\n\\nFood was average and drinks over priced. Foid was cold and undercooked 1 meal was swapped.\\n\\nStaff were awful. Taking plates before finished eating, next course out without any break. Felt like a conveyor belt get you in and out as quick as possible. Staff didnt care about quality of service\\n\\nPre advised it was a birthday all we got was \\\"oh its your birthday\\\" \\n\\nWould recommend the tower but not the restaurant \"",
            "I really want to give it 5 stars but the music was so bad. It was the same bass\\u002Fbeat over and over. Successfully drilled into my brain. \\n\\nAside from that, this was a unique restaurant experience with a rotating interior floor and the food was incredible. It takes about 90 minutes to do a full rotation. In my opinion, this is the only way to do the CN tower. On the day we went, it was a mad house. Literally nowhere to stand and people getting pushed. We almost got stuck on the way down on the observatory deck, and the staff said it was an hour to get down!! The lines were longer than they could fit people. \\n\\nThankfully, we had this reservation for lunch and with the reservation, you can still go up\\u002Fdown to see the rest of the tower. Parts of it were closed anyway. We also breezed past the long waits to go up and down the elevator. More importantly, the staff were some of the best I've seen, very on top of what you need. The food was also excellent. Highly recommend the many duck dishes! \\n\\nThe people complaining about prices have clearly never been to NYC. I thought it was just right for the experience. Our bill was around $200 for 2 people. You are paying a premium for the view, but we also thought the food was excellent! We left nothing behind!\"",
            "We had reserved at 360 as soon as it opened back lunch. We went we my family of 4, 2 adults and 2 teens. We all enjoyed our experienced.\\n\\nWe felt COVID protocols were well respected. During the 2hrs of our meal, we went around town about 1 and a half tour I would say. It was a great day and we could see all our surroundings beautifully.\\n\\nOur server was excellent and very attentive. Our water glasses were refilled efficiently, cutlery changed between services, our wine glasses topped off. He paid attention to all of us and had good conversation.\\n\\nOur teens had 2 nice options for 'mocktails', which, although small, they really enjoyed. We had the 360 blend in red that worked with our meal choice. We all had the prix fixe menu. We like that we didn't have to select the same prix fixe. For instance, one daughter had the appetizer and entree; while the other had an entree and a dessert.\\n\\nAll 4 appetizers that we tried were amazing.  Our preference would be the smoked salmon and the shrimp chowder.  For our main meal, I found the beef prime rib too large, but hubby was happy to finish for me!  His venison was excellent, with a very good cook.\\n\\nDesserts were also large and we shared. Thanks to the restaurant for a special mention of my daughter's birthday; and of a special gift for our anniversary.\\n\\nWe would definitely recommend.\"",
            "CN Tower is a \\u201Dmust do\\u201D in Toronto, and since just riding up the tower is almost as expensive as getting a two course lunch menu, we decided to have lunch.\\n\\nViews are great, you get to see all of Toronto and far beyond. Sound level is unacceptably loud. Menu choices are ok, and dishes are served nicely, but staff seems to not really have time to check on your table often enough. My wife ordered a caffe latte to go with her dessert, unfortunately we had finished dessert by the time the coffee showed up.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s \\u201Dok\\u201D value for money to have lunch instead of just paying to ride up the tower, but if you want a good lunch there are plenty of better places.\"",

However, we discovered after the meal that the waitstaff is Union in Canada. \\n\\nThe service was horrific. Food was okay, undercooked and sort of bland. The waiter was not attentive for the price paid to be there.\\n\\nWe were never asked how the food was, etc. No personable interaction with the waitstaff of any kind, it was very odd. Waitstaff very demanding of letting you know that tip expected with meal unlike the states where we tip based on service. \\n\\nWhile the view was great, it was the only good thing about being there. \\n\\nIts sad to see in 10 years that it hasnt changed.\"",
            "I bring my out of town visitors to CN Tower 360 whenever they have the time to spare.  You have the best view of Toronto, the food you offer is great, and the price is reasonable considering the entrance fee to the Tower if we don't eat at the 360 restaurant.For this visit, Michael was our server.  He made us feel welcome and was attentive without being intrusive.  When he discovered that 3 people in our party were celebrating a milestone birthday, he had the words \\\"Happy Birthday\\\" written in chocolate on our dessert plates - a wonderfully unexpected touch!Keep up the great service and delectable food and I'll keep coming back!\"",

            "I recently had the opportunity to dine at the 360 CN Tower and I would like to share my experience. While the view was amazing, I regret to say that the overall experience was below average. \\n\\nFirstly, the food was disappointing. The taste was not amazing and it seemed as though the dishes were not fresh or cooked to order. In fact, it appeared that some of the food had been heated in a microwave, which greatly affected the quality and flavor.\\n\\nSecondly, the service was extremely poor. The waiters were impatient and inconvenient, constantly asking if we had finished our meal in an attempt to rush us to order the next dish. Furthermore, the waiters dropped plates on the table abruptly, creating a less than pleasant dining atmosphere. This level of service is not what one would expect in a good restaurant.\\n\\nLastly, the facilities were poorly maintained. The men's bathroom was dirty and had an unpleasant odor. Additionally, the cutlery provided was damaged and heavily scratched, indicating a lack of attention to detail and low-quality standards.\\n\\nTaking all these factors into consideration, I cannot recommend this restaurant. The food was not fresh or tasty, the service was far from satisfactory, and the overall experience was below average. \\n\\nHowever, I must acknowledge that the view from the restaurant was indeed amazing.\"",
            "Highly overrated and underwhelming food. The view is great. Pay for that experience, but save your $$$ and eat elsewhere The prix fixe menu consisted on an appetizer\\u002Fsoup, an entree w\\u002Fveg and a dessert. That plus a glass of house wine and a beer was $300 Canadian . Service was ok, but you are definitely being hustled out so they can turn the tables. Apparently all the tourists locales are trying recoup their Covid losses in one season. All dining in Toronto is extremely expensive. I recommend getting to go meals from the local grocery stores and use you money on boat tours or experiences.\"",
            "Booked in for 4:30 dinner as other options were all after 8:30.  4:30 was early but given we had only arrived 2 day prior from Australia we had not yet adjusted to the new time zone. The early booking time did however allow us to secure a window seat. We had hoped to see the view both during the daylight and at night so booked the 3 course option. Despite this we feared we may be rushed though to accomodate a later booking. Nothing could have been further from the truth, the waiter put are fears to rest immediately by repeatedly encouraging us to relax and take our time. The food was of high quality and ample in quantity.  Service was of exceptional  as would be expected. The rotation took approximately one hour and we completed 3 rotations ending facing the setting sun. After our meal we went to the viewing platform and enjoyed the view to finish the night. A great experience from start to finish. This is not a budget night out but is well worth the cost as all elements of the \\u201Cexperience\\u201D will be a lasting memory. Well worth it.\"",
            "We had an incredible dining experience! We were seated near the window and opted to dine with the prix fixe menu, which was well curated. The food was delicious and beautifully plated, and they were very considerate of a food allergy. The service was incredible-very attentive and friendly. It was also a good value because we were able to go to the sightseeing deck of CN Tower without additional fee, so ultimately it was an even better value.\"",

            "My daughters only wish for her 9th birthday was to have dinner at the 360 Restaurant at the CN Tower. I blind folded her until we arrived and when she got there, she was ecstatic. \\n\\nI had pre booked our reservation and entry prior to arrival to make things more smooth. Check in was easy and we were able to get in with no issues within 10 minutes of arrival. Due to the pandemic, we had to wear masks, which was fine, and we had to line up outside by booked time slot to avoid crowding inside, which was expected. Safety measures were in place and everyone was very accommodating.\\n\\nThe restaurant allowed us to bring in balloons for my daughter, which was nice. They waiters also came by and sang happy birthday to my daughter, from a distance. The food was amazing (pasta with meat sauce, the steak and the pork chops) We also got a bottle of merlot which was great. \\n\\nThe waiters were prompt, pleasant and made my daughters day awesome. There was a place where you can take souvenir pictures with a background of the CN Tower, which they brought to your table if you wanted to purchase @ $40\\u002F2 pictures with a picture holder frame.\\n\\n3 meals, 2 adults, 1 child, a bottle of wine and a virgin drink totaled $380, plus the view of the entire city of Toronto, was nothing short of an AMAZING night for my princess.\"",
            "Took my wife up to the restaurant, expecting a 300 dollars bill which is fine, but limited menu and what was on the menu when presented wasn't great.  Steak was fatty , the mash runny,  my chicken was labelled as hot,  bland was more how describe it. 14 dollars for a can of cn tower lager which wasn't great. The menu is really limited small kitchen etc I get it. But the quality for what the price is doesn't match we went down stairs and the choice was far better, food looked better prepared  and presented. The upside the staff  were great, views outstanding. The most annoying thing on this trip is the forced gratitude on the bill starting at 15%. Let me choose who,what and price not someone else \"",
            "View is unbeatable. Service barely OK. Great Canadian wine selection. Food is good, although fixed course selection is weird. Would have liked to have a broader selection in open menu, although I understand this is a \\u201Cnicer\\u201D way to have the minimum expense covered.  Kids loved the flat iron steak. Stay away from the \\u201Ccharcuterie\\u201D board. If your goal is to have a great viewing experience, while eating some overpriced food, this is the place to be.\"",
            "This is a must for visiting Toronto and the CN tower - my partner and I had a wonderful time and was my favorite meal during my trip. This is great for fine dining on a smaller budget but still getting the experience - the lunch menu is an even better deal than the prix fixe menu ($10 less for 1 more guaranteed course but a significantly more limited selection). It was not crowded when we went so we did not have to fight for an edge seat and spent so long eating and admiring the skyline we easily completed an entire rotation. Dining at 360 includes admission to the rest of the tower (except for other paid experiences) but the meal and view are the most exciting, lengthy, and memorable parts of the experience. The food itself is great - my chicken was so soft it easily fell off the bone with a twist of the fork and my partner and I rapidly consumed all the vegetables. I wish the soups had more solids but all in all, would absolutely dine here again if I came to Toronto again. \"",
            "We have eaten here many times but it was my cousin and his wife's 1st time so we wanted it to be special and the 360 restaurant and staff pulled out all the stops and made our evening one to remember.  A window table , birthday wishes for the birthday boy and anniversary wishes for my cousin and wife. The service was impeccable from entry to exit. The food as always was out of this world as were the cocktails and drinks all topped off with the best view in Toronto.  Bread and whipped maple butter, butternut squash ravioli,  forged mushroom chowder, mussel pot and house smoked salmon started off our feast followed by braised lamb shanks and chicken supreme all topped off by a full array of desserts. Apple of my eye cocktails were unbelievable.  This restaurant never fails to make your night special,  see photos... THANK YOU EVERYONE IN THE 360...\"",
            "Fantastic view at a heavy price. Tortoloni was a few under cooked  lumps filled with a tasteless paste for $65.00. Shrimp cocktail 3 pieces $45! . A few dishes were ok but with tip over $600 for 4 people I'd expect some first rate dining. Go for view on the observation deck then find a really good restaurant in Toronto and have 3 excellent dinners for the same amount.

Since we know the restaurant is a Michelin rated type , we were surprised that one , it is not the strict fine dining but a rather casual one. Then the prices seem reasonable, considering the quality of food and the ambiance . I am uploading some photos. Shout out to Michael our head server who did make the birthday celebration an extra memorable for my loved ones. No worries about the wait time , you are there to enjoy the moment . And of course don\\u2019t forget to check out their very extensive bar and alcohol selection on display . Don\\u2019t mind the vertigo issues as well .\"",
            "Given the price of the items on the menu, I was expecting slightly more. The view and the building itself were great, however the food and the service was hit and miss. \\n\\nTo start we had prawn cocktail and the chowder. Both were ok, although I would tend to expect more than 3 prawns for $35. The mains again were ok, the steak was cooked very well, although the noodles accompanying the salmon dish were slightly burnt. The host was nice and friendly, as was the chap who gave us some water, although the main waiter himself wasn\\u2019t quite as friendly and showed no real interest in engaging with us outside of taking our order. \\n\\nIf this exact experience had been at a standard chain restaurant it probably would have got an extra star, but I felt that given the reputation and price point it should have been slightly better. There are plenty of other restaurants in Toronto that offer better food, better value, and better service, but not with quite as spectacular view.\"",
            "If you plan to visit the CN Tower and you can afford it book lunch in this fabulous restaurant.  It's only about $35 more for the lunch and the food and service is a much higher quality than I expected. The restaurant takes 72 minutes to do the full 360 degree turn and the views are amazing. Absolutely first class and highly recommended. Lovely waiting staff, good wine and lip smacking food beautifully presented.\"",
            "Just looking for something to kill some time and saw and ad for fixed price lunch or dinner switch access to the CN Tower and viewing platform included if you spend $75 each. I made reservations for the next day. The tower was a short walk from the InterContinental Hotel. Basically a separate line and elevator for the 360\\u00B0 restaurant which opened at 1130 avoidingthe long lines for the viewing tower.  Great 8 oz filet meal served with 2 baked potatoes because they were small, ha! ha! Normal size.  Blueberry old fashioned was excellent after I smashed the blueberries which they should have muddled. After eating, we were directed to a staircase to get to the viewing platform.   We didn't really need to do this because the view from our table as it rotated was just as good.  \"",
            "If you want the most spectacular view in Toronto this is the place to go. Yes, I know it\\u2019s very expensive, but the difference in just touring the Observatory versus having dinner and a very relaxing evening for a little bit more is well worth the trip up to the top of the tower. The minimum per person is $70, just to go up and tour Observatory it was $30. So, for $40 more a person which would be a nice dinner out anyway you have a spectacular view in a rotating restaurant at the top of the CN  tower. Also, the food was excellent and we never felt pressure to order extra wine, desserts or upgrade the menu. Service was excellent too!\"",
            "Overall a worthwhile experience because dining with such an excellent view while exchanging heartwarming conversations is not something you can put a price on. However, the minimum price tag placed on the dinner set meal is absurd at ~$70 CAD (for the food\\u2019s quality and quantity). The fact is that we are paying for the view and not the food.\\n\\nObjectively speaking, the food is decent but not excellent. By itself, it\\u2019s not worth the cost. We tried the mushroom soup, butternut ravioli, chicken, duck pasta and the pan-fried fish - no particular standouts although the ravioli tasted fresh and was more unique than the rest. The duck pasta had too strong\\u002Fheavy of a flavour, giving it a bitter after taste that I could not appreciate.\\n\\nI would only recommend this for those who value the experience to dine at your own pace while appreciating breathtaking views. To me, there was something special you couldn\\u2019t get from just experiencing CN Tower from the viewing gallery.\\n\\nAlso - I recommend going for the dinner and watch the beautiful view change from daylight to sunset to the night light up \\uD83D\\uDE0A\"",
            "Superb experience- from arriving at security as dinner guests, to the food and service in the restaurant. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable. The food was great and the prices reflect the unique venue. We didn\\u2019t feel rushed and enjoyed our meals as we rotated gently to soak up the amazing views. The Blue Jays we\\u2019re playing so the SkyDome\\u002FRogers Centre roof was open. We watched planes land and take off at both Pearson and the Island Airport. We viewed the sunset as dessert arrived and saw the lights of Niagara Falls in the distance. As the dinning turntable moves the toilets in the static central core  come around. Make your reservation with the sunset time in mind and you might get lucky. After your meal you can wander down to the public observation level and glass floor. A real treat in a remarkable structure.\"",
            "Not worth the money.views are great if you are lucky with the weather. However it's not a great dining experience. Sea food platter was expensive but did not seem fresh. The restaurant has more of a cafe feel than a restaurant.  Shame as it could be so much more. I would recommend to do the Tower but eat somewhere else. Toronto has much better restaurants than this.\"",
            "From the moment you walk in you are welcomed with quality customer service. I was not disappointed at all. First you have to make a reservation. I may have been 10 min late to mine and they still accepted me. \\n\\nWhen you first walk in just let them know you are there for the restaurant and that you have reservations. They will verbally direct you where to go. \\n\\nThere is coat check for free and an opportunity to take pictures that make it look like you are in front oh the CN tower. You will be able to view the pics when you are having your meal. \\n\\nFood\\nThe menu consist of 2 courses for $65 or 3 courses for $75. \\nI went with the 2 courses and ordered the duck salad and the Ontario chicken. I was very surprised how much I thoroughly enjoyed both. The portion sizes are decent because I ended up bringing home my leftovers. \\n\\nService\\nThe waitstaff were very professional. They constantly refilled our waters when they noticed we were running low and checked in on us at appropriate times. You do not have to tip but I tipped because I was very pleased with the service. \\n\\nAmbiance\\nNo all of the tables are by the widow. I was just lucky to get a window seat. I went at night at the city looked beautiful. When you are done eating you can go down 2 floors I believe and see Toronto. They also have glass floor tiles where you can see they you are standing over the city. You can also walk outside to view the city but it was too cold so I opted out. \\n\\nOverall\\nThis is a great experience. I would highly recommend others to partake in this experience.\"",
            "Our Dinner with a view was a nice treat for our friends visiting from Ottawa.  Service wasn\\u2019t as good as we had remembered it but meal was well put together and everyone enjoyed.  Our bread was a bit stale (served before appetizers) but the rest of the meal fresh and flavourful.  Kids sundae came and was partially melting possibly because it was sitting before it came to our table.  Wished I had said something.  Our after dinner view was obstructed by clouds and we couldn\\u2019t see past the glass.  Too bad.  \"",

We were a group of six and everyone was happy with their choices.   The bread is served cold it would be nicer if it were warm. The cesar salad has bacon and was delicious. We started with a seafood platter which was wonderful and fresh. The lamb shank, duck, prime rib and pork tenderloin were all superb. For desert we had the bread pudding and ice cream. The portions for all courses were large and plentiful. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because there were two errors on our bill which were rather significant. We caught it but this \\u201Cmistake\\u201D makes the experience less than perfect.  Make sure you take the stairs to the two lower levels and experience the views. \"",

Actually the food was better than some reviews had led us to expect, which was a bonus!\\nYes, it is expensive but the 360 includes the lift and the observation deck, so overall value is OK, and we did get a spectacular sunset, by timing our visit to arrive just before dusk.\"",
            "We had a great evening at the 360 but feel that whilst not bad value the food was not quite as good as we wanted and the wine was over priced.\\n\\nReally good experience with security and accessing the restaurant.\\nOur server was good.\\n\\nThe food\\nNeither of us fancied huge starters so we plumped for the 2 course menu.\\n\\nShort rib was really good but came with an extra supplement. \\nThe salmon was over cooked and a little dry.\\n\\nFor sweet the Cheeseboard was good albeit with a supplement again and the Sticky toffee pudding was Ok but not the best.\\n\\nThe views were fantastic as we had great sunshine followed by sunset which made for a great atmosphere.\\n\\nIn summary a must do  but we had better meals elsewhere in the city for less money.\"",

            "Visited with my wife in January 2020 for my birthday treat. \\n\\nOur reservation was for 4.30pm so we turned up at about 4pm. We had to wait until about 4.25 before being let up in the lift. We left our coats at the restaurant check in which was free.\\n\\nOn arriving at the restaurant we were checked in. I requested a window table and was shown to a two-seat table by the window. It was about 4.40 when we sat down. The weather was clear and sunset was at 5pm. Seeing the city grow dark and then gradually come to life again with lights was amazing.\\n\\nThe tables were rotating slowly at what I estimated at 1 full rotation an hour so you get to see the entire 360 degrees during your meal.\\n\\nOur waiter was superb and we were not at all rushed. \\n\\nWe both had the Prix Fixe with starters and main. I had the prime rib and my wife had the lamb shank. Both were superb. I have read a lot of reviews here that say the food was not good but all I can say is that our meal was superb with the rib especially so. Of course, it is expensive... it is at the top of the CN Tower! But it isn't just about the food. You don't have a meal at the CN tower just because you want to go out to dinner. It is a special place and it is the food, the view and the experience you pay for. We felt our meal was expensive if you just consider the food (in spite of it being a great quality) but overall, we felt that it was worth what we paid when you consider where it is.\\n\\nHighly recommended for a special occasion or if visiting Toronto as a tourist.\"",
            "I was there with a large group during a conference.\\nThis restaurant is packed full of people at long tables like spikes on a wheel, with little room to move in between. \\nAs a result, you feel like you have to lean in over the table for the waiters to get past you and you can feel them bump into you as they go past. You also feel a bit like you are packed in like animals at feed troughs.\\nThe service was rushed, and the servers not very attentive. I felt like they were pushing us to get out of there. They even had my table of colleagues move to another table so they could pack more people in despite the fact that our group had reserved that table.\\nWe had a prix fixe menu with 3 choices for the entr\\u00E9e: vegetarian risotto, salmon, or chicken. Those who had chicken said it was good, those who had salmon had overcooked salmon on undercooked kale with no sauce or seasoning, not even salt or pepper.\\nThose who had the risotto said it was inedible,  with crunchy undercooked rice and zero seasoning.\\nThe wine was horribly overpriced, I would say about 3 times the cost of a bottle at the liquor store. There was an automatic 18% gratuity added, and my friend was charged for a 9 ounce glass of wine rather than a 6 ounce glass, which was  what she ordered. Total wine cost to her:$40 for 1 glass of mediocre wine!!!\\nThe waiter kept arguing with her that he brought her a nine ounce glass, so she just gave in and paid it. I have never seen a glass of wine cost that much anywhere at any restaurant, even fine dining restaurants I have been at!\\nThe 3 course menu they offered our group was $90 pre tax and tip, also very overpriced for food that was mediocre at best, and completely inedible at worst.\\nI would recommend staying away from this restaurant. Despite the fantastic view, it does not make up for poor service and overpriced unseasoned poorly cooked food.\\nI would never recommend this to any one, when there are so many excellent restaurants in Toronto.\\nGo up to the top of the CN tower, look around and enjoy the view, then go somewhere else for dinner.\"",
            "Visited here with family, luckily, we were seated right beside a window and timed it purposely so we could experience the sunset. As far as I am aware the restaurant completes 1 - 360 degree turn per hour, but I am sure someone will correct me if this isn't accurate.\\n\\nThe menu is perhaps restricted on choice however the food was pretty good. The price is reflected in the experience as the food isn't worth what is charged. Staff are polite and attentive, and you do not feel rushed to finish dinner.\\n\\nAfter dinner you can head up to the viewing gallery.\\n\\nOverall, a memorable experience and I am glad I went.\"",
            "I booked lunch for 11 April; it\\u2019s not my first time in a revolving restaurant but you never quite get used to the fact you\\u2019re moving slowly as you sip your drinks and eat your food. \\n\\nEating in the 360 restaurant isn\\u2019t for the budget conscious but if you have the resources, I would heartily recommend spending an hour or so in the 360 degrees restaurant - the food is impeccable, the drinks fantastic and the service is exquisite. Could not fault a thing. I ordered off the a la carte menu though the prix fixe offered a number of interesting dishes. There was also an \\u2018indigenous menu\\u2019 which I was tempted by (but I don\\u2019t like gravlax) and was an interesting addition. \\n\\nFollowing lunch, you\\u2019re invited to head down to the observation platform but the views are way better from the restaurant. And you can also drop by the gift shop after for an eclectic range of quality souvenirs.\"",
            "My significant other and I visited the 360 Restaurant in the CN Tower for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  I was looking into visiting the CN Tower for viewing\\u002Fgeneral admission, however when I discovered you can make a reservation for lunch or dinner, and if you order the Prix Fixe menu option, you receive entry to the tower included \\u2013 this seemed like a much better deal!  I am so happy I chose this option, as we were able to have a delicious lunch with fantastic service and a beautiful view, for a reasonable amount more than just entry to the CN Tower.  I would HIGHLY recommend this option.  \\n\\nI was able to make a reservation easily on the CN Tower website a few weeks in advance, and upon our arrival we were whisked to a separate elevator with no line or wait, which took us to the 360 Restaurant.  We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation, however we were seated right away with a table next to the windows as I had requested when I made the reservation.  We enjoyed a relaxing and quiet lunch during the 72 minutes it takes for the restaurant to make a full revolution.  \\n\\nThe service was phenomenal throughout the meal.  The menu was very extensive with so many great-looking options.  The focus on local\\u002FCanadian cuisine was fun for us as this was our first visit to Toronto, especially the Indigenous Menu choices.  We opted for the Prix Fixe selection of 2 courses, and chose the following: \\n\\nAppetizers: \\nHot Smoked Fraser River White Sturgeon \\u2013 perfectly cooked fish, great flavor combinations.\\nCanadian Seafood Stew \\u2013 delicious, creamy, and full of perfectly cooked seafood (no skimping here!)\\n\\nMains: \\nRoasted King Cole Duck Breast \\u2013 perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy.  The accompaniments were great; the polenta, greens, and black currant jus were wonderful together. \\nCanadian Red Deer \\u2013 Filet & Sausage \\u2013 again, PERFECTLY cooked filet, and delicious sausage.\\n\\nWith the two courses, we were full by the end of the meal.  As it was my significant other\\u2019s birthday weekend, he was even surprised with a (complimentary) birthday dessert!  \\n\\nWe did try a couple of local craft beers off of the extensive drink menu, which although was mostly focused on wines (the highest wine cellar in the world!), had plenty for us beer drinkers and other NA options (the coffee was great, too).  \\n\\nI would highly recommend indulging in a visit to the 360 Restaurant, especially for a special occasion.  It was a delicious and relaxing meal, with fantastic views and service.  You won\\u2019t regret splurging \\u2013 especially when you take the restaurant-only elevator down to the other viewing floors and realize how crowded and loud the rest of the tower can be.  Thank you to the employees of the 360 Restaurant for a wonderful experience, which was a highlight of our trip to Toronto.\"",
            "My wife surprised me with a delightful dinner at the 360 restaurant. The service was great, the food delicious and delivered pretty quickly after each course. We have the 3 course fixed price menu and it was simply delicious! The starters of gnocchi and beef tartar were delivered quickly and not long after that was done we received our cornish hen and mushroom risotto. Packed full of flavour and the portions were perfect. Once again timing on dessert was perfect. Strawberry shortcake and a peach upside down cake. They accommodated a food allergy. \\n\\nSimply put, a perfect evening with an amazing view! \"",
            "We decided to eat here as we wanted to visit the tower and this was a good way to do two things at once.  The dinner was really nice and the fixe price menu is only $20 more than the entrance price to the viewing deck.  I would recommend this as the way to go.  The view was spectacular as you would expect and the restaurant rotates so you get different views as your eating dinner.  Both our meals were good.  We shared charcuterie as a starter, I had a pasta with duck ragu and my husband had lamb shanks, finishing with the cheese board to share.  We didn't have wine, just opted for beer instead.  The service was good and the staff were very friendly.Everything was good and then you get to visit the viewing platform after your meal.\"",
            "We made our reservation knowing this was a big tourist spot and our expectations for the food were not high.   We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of our meals, which were excellent.   The service was top notch.  Although the prix fixe menu is rather high, when we figured that the meal entitled us to admission to the observation deck (which we would have otherwise paid for), we felt it was a decent value.  \\nThe tables were far enough apart that we felt safe Covid-wise.  Everyone was observant about wearing masks any time they were not seated at their tables.  The staff, of course, was properly masked at all times.\\nWe could not get a dinner reservation, so we went for a late lunch.   In hindsight, that was a great decision as we got a clear view of the city during daylight and could pick out places we had seen on foot.\"",
            "To get a \\u2018Free\\u2019 ride up if you book the restaurant  with a minimum spend of \\u00A375 per person.  So not a cheap day but the views are amazing! Service fantastic whilst eating food was lovely!! Fresh lobsters and steak was really good. They do recommend 2 sides per person but the sides are huge so recommend 2 per couple. The only issue for me is you can go to the viewing deck after dinner but when you exit you join the normal queue for the lifts which is a bit annoying when you have just spent $600 on lunch\"",
            "A Must Visit\\u2026When You Are In Toronto! If you want to celebrate that special day, the 360 restaurant on top of the CN Tower is the place to be. Good food, a fine dining experience and a breath taking view is what defines this place.\\nThe food is good (some people with dietary restrictions might feel that options are limited, especially if you are a vegetarian), and the portion size is pretty good. If you go for the prix fix menu, you would be pretty full at the end. Some might say that the place is a little pricey, and it is, but if you count in the fact that the CN tower admission (Almost a $40 value per head) is included in it, it doesn\\u2019t feel that expensive then.\\nThe most unique thing about the restaurant is that it is slowly rotating giving you a full 360 view of the city (hence the name) and nothing can beat it.\\n\\nPro Tip \\u2013 Try to make a reservation for a table at around sunset. You would get an amazing view of the city in the daylight, sunset and night!\"",

The view was fantastic, the food was delicious and every server and other staff member we encountered was professional, friendly, efficient and helpful.  I would highly recommend 360 Restaurant for a special occasion or a fun night out.\"",
            "We just concluded a wonderful return to Toronto over the holiday weekend.  We were lucky to get a 4 30 p.m. reservation on a Sunday night.  If we booked earlier than 5 days in advance we might have been able to see the sunset.  My wife and I ordered the 3 course Prix Fixe meal, and our daughter had the same from the children\\u2019s menu.  We loved the Wedge Salad, mussels, Pork Chop, chicken, Chocolate Mousse, and ice cream.  Beautiful views of the city and lake on the slow rotating platform.  Access to the viewing tower as well.  This is a must do while visiting Toronto.  Service and drinks were great too.\"",
            "Visited here last night for my birthday dinner with my wife and family . I have to say the view out was blinding , could see for miles . Now for the restaurant! It\\u2019s very expensive fir what it is, don\\u2019t get me wrong the food was nice but not worth the prices . The drinks were overpriced aswell & beer selection was poor! As for the waiters and expecting tips of around \\u00A360 I thought that was a bit of a liberty . I can understand tipping but when they ask for a minimum of 15% it works out a lot . Would go there again for the view but not for the restaurant.\"",
            "What can I say - you are sitting in a huge revolving restaurant at the top of a really tall tower at night with Toronto twinkling below you. It's magnificent with a view to die for. The food isn't bad, although not the best I have ever tasted meaning it is a little expensive but the location makes it worth it. The staff are helpful and efficient.\\n\\nIt is difficult to get good photos as the windows reflect so much so drink it all into your memory. You get fast tracked to the top and come down to look through the glass ceilings \\u002F windows so that helps and you can always take your photos there.\"",
            "There is no doubt!  This restaurant has the amazing draw of its spectacular views of the lovely city of Toronto. \\nThat said I was delighted to find the food was from a creative kitchen team.

I booked at 7:15 and was given a window seat and was able to see the city during the day\\u002Fsunset and nighttime. Since I took the prix fixe option, I had free access to the observation deck- bonus! Amazing experience, really recommend!\"",
            "This restaurant is basically a tourist attraction delivering mediocre food at very inflated prices. However, you get a wonderful view of the City whilst the restaurant revolves around 360 degrees. If you\\u2019re on a budget this is not the place for you though\""

            "On a recent business trip we wanted to have a decent meal after spending most mights travelling and at airports with mostly snacks instead of full meals.\\n\\nWe showed up at Jacob's without reservation and the place was packed. We were asked if we are willing to take a seat at the bar upstairs and it ended up being an excellent location. The chairs were comfortable and being so close to the bartenders has its' advantages when making dring selections. We had a wine and gin tonic (good gin selection) and browsed through the menu.\\n\\nThe menu ha s  a great selection of steaks up to ridiculous 800 CAD for a piece of meat. I am not sure if I would ever spend that much money on food so we focussed on the left side of the menu and eded up with a mid-priced dry-aged ribeye with brussel sprouts and  creamed spinach. We were served some warm bread and butter, unfortunately the restaurant does not serve any gluten free bread as you would expect in high end stead houses like this one. The service was quick and the meat excellent. The sides were also excellent and the server even offered to split the sides as one of us wanted the brussel sprouts without the walnuts.\\n\\nAll in all a great experience and well worth the money. we ended up with a total bill of 240 CAD which was money well spent on the quality of food, service and location.\"",
            "I have reviewed this restaurant before. It is only one of two to which I have given 5 stars. Our last visit was, if possible, better than our last. We are now better at ordering than we were the last time (when we had one whole steak that was surplus to need). We had rib eye and a large T bone for four people.

Ours were perfectly cooked and served with three different salt choices and three different sauce choices. You can add foie gras or marrow if you prefer. The duck fat fries are delicious. Lots of sides choices. We tried the salmon tartare and the jumbo shrimp which were both excellent. They also serve warm popovers which is a nice touch and avoids filling up on bread.  Good wine list and cocktail options. Jacobs is pricey but doesn\\u2019t disappoint.\"",
            "We arrived and were greeted nicely. Jackets hung and a gentleman helped us and then introduced us to the hostess.  Washrooms and atmosphere very high end.We were there for a family dinner and made our reso 10 days ago. Only down side we had to sit near the bar because of the timing of when we reserved. It was very noisy and hard to hear one another.  The appetizers were just ok (didn't blow my mind) beet salad, ceasar salad (although cool feature creating it at the table), bresola (all were just 6\\u002F10 and about $20 each). The steak and sides came all at one time and all hot, and all to perfect taste.  The steak itself was delish and it is worth trying the real waygu beef.  The waitress was great at telling us what was 'too  much' which was nice, given the prices.  40oz for 5 people was enough to share.  The sides were good, and you are able to order half portions if you want to taste some of them.  The special mushrooms (not the regular side mushrooms, they had a feature on) were good not amazing. If you are looking to eat healthy -this is not the place- butter and salt are what makes it great. The martini was perfect and done with grey goose and nice olives. On the way out they give you a take home of muffins and walk you out. Felt very nice and taken care of.  Its worth the price.  If i returned i would order for myself a 4 oz waygu beef and a garden salad. That would be a perfect amount and probably give the ability to appreciate the beef.  We were gluttons :).  Also my MIL was not great on steps- this is not super friendly to people who have trouble with that.\"",

            "I've been to Jacobs many times and it never ceases to amaze me. You'll always get a wonderfully cooked steak with great service.\\n\\nI must give a shout-out to our server, Samuel. He gave a great introduction and walkthrough of the menu to my colleagues who were first timers. He also helped make a side dish into a halal friendly option for my colleague.\\n\\nAs for the menu, you can skip the apps. They're nothing special and imho, they're overpriced and underwhelming. You go to Jacobs for the steak. \\n\\nI've eaten many different cuts but I was impressed to see them offering more interesting international cuts. My colleague and I decided to split two steaks, a traditional option and then a more artisanal option.\\n\\nI had a 24 oz bone-in ribeye from Arkansas which was absolutely amazing. The marbling was fabulous. It just melted in your mouth. They rendered the fat cap beautifully so it didn't have chewy bits of fat. It was aged for 55 days iirc. It had such a beautiful aroma. This was the traditional steak.\\n\\nThe second steak was the highest grade of steak out of Scotland. The producer stamps the cow for authenticity purposes. I can't remember the name of the brand. We had the bone-in strip. It's not aged as long (30 days) since it's grass fed. So it has a bit more of a chew and it's less sweet. We liked it but the traditional steak was much better. For transparency purposes, I'm a ribeye guy. But I still think the meat itself didn't taste as good or have the same buttery texture as the traditionally raised ribeye from Kansas.\\n\\nWe had the potato puree, tossed mushrooms with a olive oil and garlic sauce which Samuel hooked up since the original recipe included marsala wine. My colleague is Muslim and Samuel took care of it. We also had the duck fat fries. The sides were all delicious but the fries were the best. They were crispy on the outside and fluffy in the inside.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered a 6 oz Australian 9+ marbling score fillet. It was very good but honestly, it's better to pay another $100 and get A5 from Japan. It's levels better than the Australian equivalent. There's just nothing that compares to an A5. It's the ultimate luxury in steaks and it actually lives up to the hype!\\n\\nOne last thing, don't go to Jacobs if you're frugal or not comfortable paying $200+ on a meal. If you want to splurge and\\u002For celebrate, there's no better place than Jacobs for steak. It's not even close. I've covered all of the top spots in Toronto and no one touches Jacobs. It's not just the steak, their service is amazing. They aren't snobby which is so refreshing given the price point of the restaurant. I saw people in track pants and others in suits. It's such a great vibe. Ask for the main dining room upstairs to get the real experience. The piano bar is ok but if it's an occasion, make sure to get the main dining area.\\n\\nWe had a bottle of red wine which went very well with the steak. It was a California Cab Sauv.\"",
            "I've dined at high-end steakhouses in the various beef meccas of North America: NYC, Dallas, Las Vegas, Kansas City, Chicago, etc.  Jacob's, here in Toronto, is the best spot I've ever frequented. True fact.\\n\\nMy wife and I love Jacob's so much, it's in regular rotation on the anniversary, birthday, and Valentine's Day circuit.\\n\\nEveryone's beef tastes are unique, but having sampled several cuts and varieties from the menu, I still find myself gravitating more often to the simple, grass-fed Alberta filets that are available (and bonus, they're the least expensive options!!).  Rich, velvety beef perfection accompanied by exotic salts, blue cheese, herbed butter, Chimichurri sauce, etc.\\n\\nJacob's also wins points for truly elevated sides and apps that are worthy of the prices! The Caesar salad made table-side is the best Caeser I've ever had!  No lie.\\n\\nA couple-times a year luxury that is worth your hard-earned dollars.  Very highly recommended.\"",
            "I recently went to this restaurant and I had mix feelings about the experience. \\n\\nThe service is amazing and there is nothing to complain about it. The food is another story. \\n\\nI ordered a strip loin from Australia and I also tried a 60 day aged ribeye. Both stakes were ok, but they were nothing special for the price we paid. I understand stakes need to be aggressively seasoned, but they were way too salty. \\n\\nWe ordered several side dishes for the table and some of them were amazing while others were not good. The fries were way too salty and they had what I call a weird seasoning. It was not truffle, it was more like star anise that I don\\u2019t like. I also tried Shrimp as entree and although they are big that may justify the price, they were overcooked to my taste. \\n\\nDauphinoise (scallop potatoes) is a different story. The dish is amazing. Potatoes were cooked perfectly and the combination of cheeses and cream was glorious. \\n\\nI tasted few other things and this is my recommendation: Baked Oyster, Dauphinoise and the 60-day aged rib-eye. \\n\\nIt is a good place to see pretty people, but I would rather spend money in other restaurants were food is better.\"",

Just speaking on the food - it was spectacular. \\n\\nWe went to Jacobs & Co. for a birthday dinner. Everything we ate was insane. I still dream of the caesar salad we had. They make it right in front of you which is cool, but the taste is unlike anything I've had. DEFINITELY get the caesar salad. The seafood tower was fresh, and the beef tartare was incredible for sure the best I've ever had. There's some sort of duck fat poutine from what I remember, which was also 10\\u002F10. The steaks... I can't even go into detail but they're unbelievable. \\n\\nAside from how awesome the food is, the service is A1. Our server knew absolutely everything about the steaks.

I have not had much Wagyu so can\\u2019t say how it compares but overall it was incredible.  A lot of flavor and melted in my mouth.\\n\\nI also loved the creamed spinach, tasted more like gruyere than spinach, a big plus in my book.

I must say that their steak has set the bar so high that now I always feel disappointed at regular steak houses.

            "Yesterday was my second time venturing into this wonderland of gastronomy.  We were celebrating my son and daughter's birthday.  The seemingly endless variety of steaks from around the world would be enough to send anyone reeling with indecision.  However, our server - who has been there 9 years - expertly guided our party of four so that we were able to make, what turned out to be, very reasonable decisions.  We wound up sharing the A5 Black Tajima-Miyazaki Prefecture California cut (8 ounces - $216), which is a melt-in-your-mouth delicacy that must be tried if you've never before experienced it, and the Canadian-raised Porterhouse (40 ounces - $240).  That amount of steak combined with the expertly made-at-the-table Caesar salad (a bit of entertainment all on its own), the creamed corn (surprisingly tasty), and the garlicky sauteed rapini (yum) were more than sufficient to satisfy the appetites of four hungry diners.  Because the restaurant was aware of the birthday celebrations, they brought us tasty (and free) sweets, with a lit candle on a plate, all surrounded by chocolate \\\"happy birthday\\\" scrolled on the plate's surface.  All of that, together with a relatively inexpensive bottle of Spanish Marques Murrieta Riserva (which was a perfect choice for the meat) made for a wonderful meal.  The service was outstanding.  We were attended to just at the right times, and with quiet efficiency.  Our main server ensured that all our needs were met.  We all felt welcomed and probably just as well tended to as those cows who gave us their all so that we could have a perfect meal.\\nWarning, this place is probably the most expensive restaurant I've ever dined in, including Michelin restaurants in other countries.  But for a special occasion, it's well worth the second mortgage you will have to take out on your house!\"",
            "This is a once in a while place that I'll go to. Went here once and yes, it was expensive. The service was 1st class! The meat choices are excellent although one thing I noticed was I had to season the steak after it's been cooked. So they gave us different kinds of salts or something but I wish I could've had it seasoned prior to cooking as I'm not really good in mixing ingredients.\"",
            "We visited for dinner on Labor Day Monday. It\\u2019s an upscale venue, and it was fairly quiet inside, despite being full. The selection of steaks here is overwhelming, but also one of the reasons I chose to visit, as it piqued my curiosity! Our server did a good job of explaining the array of options. We both went for Wagyu variants, myself a rib-eye and my wife chose a tenderloin, and we added a few sides (which are available in half portions if desired). I already started to get a good feeling about the meal when they delivered the bread, which was delicious! It was a fluffy, cheesy bread that was straight out of the oven. Happily, the standard was maintained from there, as the steaks and sides were excellent! We shared a peach cobbler for dessert, which was very nice as well.\\n\\nService was very friendly and very quick, which we preferred as we were accompanied by our toddler. The bill came to around $550 including a couple of drinks (but before tip), of which close to $400 was spent on the two steaks. For sure this is a very expensive place, but we loved our meal here, and I think the cost was justified. The selection on offer alone makes the place somewhat unique, and I haven\\u2019t come across anything like it in the UK or elsewhere.\"",

The food quality was very good on the whole but not particularly outstanding and not significantly better or different from other Toronto steakhouses despite the elevated price tag at STK. The parmesan-crusted mashed potatoes were the best part of dinner. We each had a 6-ounce filet mignon, which was cooked to the requested doneness and was well seasoned. While we have had better steak elsewhere, the steak here was on par with other local steak chain restaurants. The calamari appetizer was enjoyable. The sourdough bread with \\u201Cblue butter\\u201D (a mixture of blue cheese and butter), while something I enjoyed, was not as particularly liked by my husband who does not like blue cheese. It would have been preferable if the blue butter had been served on the side. We weren\\u2019t aware that this bread & blue butter was a complimentary offering until it arrived at our table, or we would have requested the blue butter on the side if that is possible.

It didn't feel very friendly, but is is effective. We arrived 5 minutes before our time slot and were seated in the middle of the restaurant. The table was small, the music very loud!

            "It was expensive. It was noisy. ... and the food was really disappointing! Two of us ordered the Christmas dinner. At $55 a plate, it tasted like a dried out rolled turkey breast. The sides were unremarkable and it was over all salted. One of our party did order a steak and was not impressed. Our table service was really good, but we were surprised when our table was ready and the waitress (or hostess?) told us to settle at the bar before moving to our table. I don\\u2019t know of any higher end restaurants who don\\u2019t make that a seamless process for the diner. Most disgusting was the condition of the women\\u2019s washroom. Toilet paper on the floors. Unflushed toilets. A quiet comment to the hostess at the beginning of the evening seemed to have little impact with our guest experiencing much the same conditions at the end of the evening. I have been to the STK in London and loved the experience enough to recommend the Toronto location,for Christmas Day. We won\\u2019t be back.\"",
            "I've been to STK Toronto several times, but my most recent experience was my last time. Upon making a reservation for a small party, half our party was running about 10 minutes late so we were told to wait in the bar. Oddly enough, the restaurant was about 40-50% empty and the hostess could have easily sat us at our table.\\n\\nOnce the remaining members of our group arrived, we got seated to our table. We were there on a Thursday, the same day the restaurant has half price cocktails but to my surprise, this only applied if we physically went to the bar, drank there and proceeded back to our table, otherwise we would have to pay full. This was completely bizarre and unheard of especially since were were all dining there too.\\n\\nWhen I requested a specific appetizer, the server told me they had it but came back 10 minutes later to inform me it was out of stock. Disappointing but acceptable.\\n\\nMy group (excluding myself) all ordered a specific oz. steak and once again, 15 minutes after taking the order, the server comes back to inform the entire group that the size they requested was not in stock and that they should change the order. I had to push my group to speak to her again and request a price match for the next size up. Upon checking with her manager, she offered the size up for a few dollars extra. \\n\\nOnce again, disappointing because as a server you should have clear communication with your kitchen staff as to what is and is not available. \\n\\nWhen my steak finally arrived, I was already disappointed with our appetizers (which were over-priced for the quality) and my steak itself was order-cooked. \\n\\nThere were a few additional things to mention but I won't bother. Long story short, STK Toronto's quality has downgraded drastically along with their customer service skills. \\n\\nI do NOT recommend this restaurant and would rather recommend competitor steakhouses in Toronto if you want attentive service and a quality meal.\"",
            "Went with a group of about ten friends for a bachelor party. \\n\\nThe interior is cool, but I feel like this place exists first and foremost to be in people's Instagram photos. The food and cocktails are exceptionally overpriced for what they are. The steak was average - one guys was very overcooked. Short rib was dry, and the sides were relatively flavorless. It wasn't awful, but it certainly wasn't good and definitely isn't worth what they're charging.\\n\\nThe most disappointing thing, however, was the state of the men's restroom. What a disaster. I don't think it was cleaned once in the two and a half hours we were there. Urine on the floor, sinks were gross, they ran out of paper towels and the garbage was overflowing. Not exactly what you want to see after paying $200 for dinner.\\n\\nI would recommend going to one of the many other high end Toronto steakhouses instead.

After enjoying 6 fresh, delicious Raspberry Point oysters and melt-in-your-mouth Jalapeno Cheddar Grit Croquettes over vodka martinis and Green Intensity cocktails, we eventually moved to a beautiful bright window seat for 2 to order main courses. We were a little unsure if our request to move was the right thing to do because the service at the bar was phenomenal but we were drawn to the twinkling glass and sparkling cutlery of  a beautifully set table overlooking some of the best people-watching lanes of upscale Toronto.\\nThe second part of the dinner consisted of Rib Eye with Blue Butter Sauce for him and seared Atlantic Scallops with Mousseline sauce, artichokes and crispy bacon over the creamiest mashed potatoes ever for me, with a side of Crispy Brussels Sprouts and Maple Bacon Jam to share.

The vibe was very upbeat and the place was packed by the time we left.\\nThis is a new fave in Toronto. I can`t wait to go back for a seafood tower and he really wants a fillet with foie gras.

Friday dinner at 7pmish, the music was very much \\\"rave\\\" type, which I didn't mind, but it was too loud for a background music at an upscale restaurant.\\nTowards the end of our meal (9 pmish) it was a softer music, but i still find it too loud for dinning section thus the 3 star review.\"",
            "I went with friends for winterlicious dinner.  The food mind you wasn\\u2019t bad, but I question the cleanliness and the way the staff handled food there.  A manager approached us asking if there was a hair in one of our friends salad, thankfully no.  I had the steak and as soon as we were done it just hit me.  I felt sick and out of commission for days so I had to miss a couple of days of work.  I had lost my appetite since that night, stomach ache, throbbing headaches and vomiting til this day.  I was perhaps the unlucky one.  Who knows how long my steak had been sitting there collecting germ?  We did have to wait a long while for our food.  Glad I didn\\u2019t order off the regular menu what I had intended to initially do, because I would have been paying more for food poisoning.  The service and everything else was great otherwise.\"",

The service was rushed, and the steaks were on the burnt side. The restaurant was packed, and they had a DJ as well, that made the noise in the restaurant to be quite close to unbearable, as we couldn't really entertain much conversation at the table. I won't come back here, as there are better steakhouses in Toronto!\"",

Who would have thought of using some crushed cookies to provide the sweetness to balance the rich taste of fois gras.  It gave it a really mixed and delicious sensation.

Everyone ate their dinner while I was waiting for them to fix my steak. By the time it arrived everyone was finished eating and I had to eat alone. There was also still blood in the new steak they had brought for me. The disappointing part is that it was a waste of a night out, and they didn\\u2019t even apologize about the inconvenience.

The food had good flavor but the steak was hard, dry and full of nerves that made it impossible to eat.

            "There were five of us at a business diner. Our host ordered the wine and we ordered our own meals. On reading the menu I was surprised at the price of the Steaks. They are extremely expensive but I guess that this is the speciality of the house and I should have ordered steak. I ordered a Dover Sole and was definitely very disappointed. It was highly over salted so much so that I didn\\u2019t stop drinking all night.\\nI tasted my husbands Pasta with Mushrooms and Truffle sauce. The Truffle was definitely missing as I eat them whenever I can so I do know the flavor. Also the Pasta was well overcooked and mushy.\"",

Enjoyable with friends but perhaps not the best setting for a quiet evening for two. \\nThe food wasn\\u2019t anything special, as for the steaks, side dishes and seafood. Very comparable at many other local restaurants. Prices are inflated and be prepared to pay for additional sides with your steak. The menu price if you order a steak only includes the steak. If you wish to have a vegetable, salad or potato  you will pay extra for each. The only place I can honestly say I\\u2019ve been where you get nothing at all with your steak. They will try and push the group seafood appetizer on you for 70$ per person,  a complete disappointment.  Be prepared after you have paid for your expensive meal to be hurried along.\\nThankfully it was more about the people then the food which is what made the evening great.\"",
            "It's hard to describe the decor at STK - very modern with semi-circular booths and funky white tubular objects on the ceiling.  We had dinner with a large group in one of the private dining rooms (nice view over Avenue Road) so avoided the loud atmosphere of the main room (DJ spinning music all evening long and a very active bar scene).  The steaks were good but it was the accompaniments and appetizers that I loved best.  The steak tartare was one of the best I've ever had and I could have eaten three pounds of the truffle parmesan fried potatoes.  Save room for dessert - the chocolate chip cookie served hot in a skillet is to die for.  An exceptional wine list and good service.  A great evening.\"",
            "We arrived but were slightly confused as to where to go as nobody was on the front desk, we were seated in a nice round table to the edge of the restaurant.  Nice modern interiors.  The menu had a great selection of steaks at a variety of prices and a limited vegetarian selection. \\n\\nWe ordered a flat iron steak, vegetarian risotto and a tomahawk steak for 2, we were advised to order 4 sides. The steaks were cooked to perfection and just melted. The grits were fantastic, the glazed sprouts  were everyone else\\u2019s favourite.  The garlicky sweet potatoes were a very generous portion, asparagus with Parmesan. In fact we only really needed 3 sides.  $350 for 4 mains 4 sides a bottle of wine and 2 bottles of sparkling water. I loved the restaurant my companions less so. A much younger crowd with lots of groups of woman.  Seemed to have a good bar scene in a separate area.\"",

The design of the restaurant is beautiful. We had several appetizers and cocktails. Of course the steak was to die for. I had the bone-in filet, highly recommended.

We have gone to other chefs tables at other establishments and when you paid extra you felt you got something extra ie more privacy, a better view etc. this isn\\u2019t the case here.\"",

            "The restaurant offers a great view of the city if you manage to get the right table but apart from that, there isn't a lot that is special about it. The menu is limited which typically isn't a problem if the food is flavourful. In this case, the food was quite tasteless - we ordered several dishes across all courses - and remained disappointed throughout. The portions also are small and the service is less than satisfactory. Our server for one could barely manage to smile throughout the 2 hours we were there. When you take all that in and look at the steep prices, it just doesn't seem worth it. \"",

            "It's been a long time since my wife and I went to the CN Tower, but we were meeting a friend for lunch downtown, and decided to make an event of it.   Upon arrival you actually feel kind of special.   You have a private elevator ride to the top from your own entrance.   Upon arrival at the top of Toronto, I felt a warm welcome as we were escorted to the table, with a beautiful view of Toronto Harbour and Lake Ontario.  We could see all the way to Niagara Falls.    As we span around slowly in 72 min we saw all of Toronto on the clearest day I can remember.   Now onto the food.  The food is pricey.  Let's get that out of the way.   The fixed price is $90 if you have a dessert.  My lunch was the pork chop that was huge and delicious.  I expected smaller portions but pleasantly surprised.   All our meals exceeded our expectations.  Service was friendly but not overly attentive.   It couldn't have been a better lunch.   Well ... except for the price.   With tip of 20% and a $100 bottle of wine ... it was $535 for 3 people.  However when you factor in the cost of $45 each for going up the CN tower (which reservations at 360 is included), it's not as much a shock, considering how incredible the meal and experience was.   Would I go there for lunch or dinner again ... absolutely.\"",
            "Great views and a nice vibe, but the food was a huge disappointment and an embarrassment to take a business acquaintances.  Cafeteria quality food in that the mains are all precooked hours in advance.  The pork chops were like shoe leather, and my fish was overcooked. The only the dessert were at an acceptable level.  I would not return to eat there. We were served very quickly and rushed out in a hurry as well.  We ate 3 courses and were presented.  with our bill and out the door in one hour. So their focus in on  turn over and not on the food.  \"",
            "We had reserved at 360 as soon as it opened back lunch. We went we my family of 4, 2 adults and 2 teens. We all enjoyed our experienced.\\n\\nWe felt COVID protocols were well respected. During the 2hrs of our meal, we went around town about 1 and a half tour I would say. It was a great day and we could see all our surroundings beautifully.\\n\\nOur server was excellent and very attentive. Our water glasses were refilled efficiently, cutlery changed between services, our wine glasses topped off. He paid attention to all of us and had good conversation.\\n\\nOur teens had 2 nice options for 'mocktails', which, although small, they really enjoyed. We had the 360 blend in red that worked with our meal choice. We all had the prix fixe menu. We like that we didn't have to select the same prix fixe. For instance, one daughter had the appetizer and entree; while the other had an entree and a dessert.\\n\\nAll 4 appetizers that we tried were amazing.  Our preference would be the smoked salmon and the shrimp chowder.  For our main meal, I found the beef prime rib too large, but hubby was happy to finish for me!  His venison was excellent, with a very good cook.\\n\\nDesserts were also large and we shared. Thanks to the restaurant for a special mention of my daughter's birthday; and of a special gift for our anniversary.\\n\\nWe would definitely recommend.\"",

We had to wait until about 4.25 before being let up in the lift. We left our coats at the restaurant check in which was free.\\n\\nOn arriving at the restaurant we were checked in. I requested a window table and was shown to a two-seat table by the window. It was about 4.40 when we sat down. The weather was clear and sunset was at 5pm. Seeing the city grow dark and then gradually come to life again with lights was amazing.\\n\\nThe tables were rotating slowly at what I estimated at 1 full rotation an hour so you get to see the entire 360 degrees during your meal.\\n\\nOur waiter was superb and we were not at all rushed. \\n\\nWe both had the Prix Fixe with starters and main. I had the prime rib and my wife had the lamb shank. Both were superb. I have read a lot of reviews here that say the food was not good but all I can say is that our meal was superb with the rib especially so. Of course, it is expensive... it is at the top of the CN Tower! But it isn't just about the food. You don't have a meal at the CN tower just because you want to go out to dinner. It is a special place and it is the food, the view and the experience you pay for. We felt our meal was expensive if you just consider the food (in spite of it being a great quality) but overall, we felt that it was worth what we paid when you consider where it is.\\n\\nHighly recommended for a special occasion or if visiting Toronto as a tourist.\"",

            "It was a double birthday dinner for my spouse and sister in law . We ordered the 2 course deal , which included an entrance to the CN tower observation deck. Since we know the restaurant is a Michelin rated type , we were surprised that one , it is not the strict fine dining but a rather casual one. Then the prices seem reasonable, considering the quality of food and the ambiance . I am uploading some photos. Shout out to Michael our head server who did make the birthday celebration an extra memorable for my loved ones. No worries about the wait time , you are there to enjoy the moment . And of course don\\u2019t forget to check out their very extensive bar and alcohol selection on display . Don\\u2019t mind the vertigo issues as well .\"",
            "We were excited to dine at the 360 restaurant and arrived to chaos at the entrance to the CN Tower.  There was a huge line up and it took some time and asking attendants where to go.  Needless to say we were faced with another line up.  There is only 2 elevators and each elevator only takes 18 people at a time so had to wait for a few elevators and were 15 minutes late for our reservation.  Nowhere in any of the information provided at the time we reserved said to allow time to get to the restaurant.\\nWe had no sooner ordered and received our drinks when our appetizers were thrust upon us.  Then the main courses arrived soon after leaving little time to finish our cocktails and take in the view.  It says each reservation is allocated 2 hours well it felt like they were trying to get you out in an hour (which was the case).  The seafood platter was not good as the lobster was tough and the mussels were skimpy.  The 2 course for $75 wasn\\u2019t worth $75.  Our waiter Mike R. in finalizing our bill literally threw my receipt at me and couldn\\u2019t even be bothered to thank me.  I left at tip but I regret it along with the $300+ I spent.  We didn\\u2019t even bother spending any more time at the top even though it was included in our reservation.  Avoid the restaurant completely would be my advice.  I received a request from the restaurant for feedback and I shared this experience and you would think I would have heard back but they don\\u2019t care.  Avoid the restaurant.\"",
            "We had an incredible dining experience! We were seated near the window and opted to dine with the prix fixe menu, which was well curated. The food was delicious and beautifully plated, and they were very considerate of a food allergy. The service was incredible-very attentive and friendly. It was also a good value because we were able to go to the sightseeing deck of CN Tower without additional fee, so ultimately it was an even better value.\"",
            "I really want to give it 5 stars but the music was so bad. It was the same bass\\u002Fbeat over and over. Successfully drilled into my brain. \\n\\nAside from that, this was a unique restaurant experience with a rotating interior floor and the food was incredible. It takes about 90 minutes to do a full rotation. In my opinion, this is the only way to do the CN tower. On the day we went, it was a mad house. Literally nowhere to stand and people getting pushed. We almost got stuck on the way down on the observatory deck, and the staff said it was an hour to get down!! The lines were longer than they could fit people. \\n\\nThankfully, we had this reservation for lunch and with the reservation, you can still go up\\u002Fdown to see the rest of the tower. Parts of it were closed anyway. We also breezed past the long waits to go up and down the elevator. More importantly, the staff were some of the best I've seen, very on top of what you need. The food was also excellent. Highly recommend the many duck dishes! \\n\\nThe people complaining about prices have clearly never been to NYC. I thought it was just right for the experience. Our bill was around $200 for 2 people. You are paying a premium for the view, but we also thought the food was excellent! We left nothing behind!\"",

He made us feel welcome and was attentive without being intrusive.  When he discovered that 3 people in our party were celebrating a milestone birthday, he had the words \\\"Happy Birthday\\\" written in chocolate on our dessert plates - a wonderfully unexpected touch!Keep up the great service and delectable food and I'll keep coming back!\"",

The starters of gnocchi and beef tartar were delivered quickly and not long after that was done we received our cornish hen and mushroom risotto. Packed full of flavour and the portions were perfect.

We were a group of six and everyone was happy with their choices.   The bread is served cold it would be nicer if it were warm. The cesar salad has bacon and was delicious. We started with a seafood platter which was wonderful and fresh. The lamb shank, duck, prime rib and pork tenderloin were all superb. For desert we had the bread pudding and ice cream. The portions for all courses were large and plentiful. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because there were two errors on our bill which were rather significant.

            "If you want the most spectacular view in Toronto this is the place to go. Yes, I know it\\u2019s very expensive, but the difference in just touring the Observatory versus having dinner and a very relaxing evening for a little bit more is well worth the trip up to the top of the tower. The minimum per person is $70, just to go up and tour Observatory it was $30. So, for $40 more a person which would be a nice dinner out anyway you have a spectacular view in a rotating restaurant at the top of the CN  tower.

The menu is really limited small kitchen etc I get it. But the quality for what the price is doesn't match we went down stairs and the choice was far better, food looked better prepared  and presented. The upside the staff  were great, views outstanding.

            "This is a must for visiting Toronto and the CN tower - my partner and I had a wonderful time and was my favorite meal during my trip. This is great for fine dining on a smaller budget but still getting the experience - the lunch menu is an even better deal than the prix fixe menu ($10 less for 1 more guaranteed course but a significantly more limited selection). It was not crowded when we went so we did not have to fight for an edge seat and spent so long eating and admiring the skyline we easily completed an entire rotation. Dining at 360 includes admission to the rest of the tower (except for other paid experiences) but the meal and view are the most exciting, lengthy, and memorable parts of the experience. The food itself is great - my chicken was so soft it easily fell off the bone with a twist of the fork and my partner and I rapidly consumed all the vegetables. I wish the soups had more solids but all in all, would absolutely dine here again if I came to Toronto again. \"",
            "View is unbeatable. Service barely OK. Great Canadian wine selection. Food is good, although fixed course selection is weird. Would have liked to have a broader selection in open menu, although I understand this is a \\u201Cnicer\\u201D way to have the minimum expense covered.  Kids loved the flat iron steak. Stay away from the \\u201Ccharcuterie\\u201D board. If your goal is to have a great viewing experience, while eating some overpriced food, this is the place to be.\"",
            "We made our reservation knowing this was a big tourist spot and our expectations for the food were not high.   We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of our meals, which were excellent.   The service was top notch.  Although the prix fixe menu is rather high, when we figured that the meal entitled us to admission to the observation deck (which we would have otherwise paid for), we felt it was a decent value.  \\nThe tables were far enough apart that we felt safe Covid-wise.  Everyone was observant about wearing masks any time they were not seated at their tables.  The staff, of course, was properly masked at all times.\\nWe could not get a dinner reservation, so we went for a late lunch.   In hindsight, that was a great decision as we got a clear view of the city during daylight and could pick out places we had seen on foot.\"",
            "Overall a worthwhile experience because dining with such an excellent view while exchanging heartwarming conversations is not something you can put a price on. However, the minimum price tag placed on the dinner set meal is absurd at ~$70 CAD (for the food\\u2019s quality and quantity). The fact is that we are paying for the view and not the food.\\n\\nObjectively speaking, the food is decent but not excellent. By itself, it\\u2019s not worth the cost. We tried the mushroom soup, butternut ravioli, chicken, duck pasta and the pan-fried fish - no particular standouts although the ravioli tasted fresh and was more unique than the rest. The duck pasta had too strong\\u002Fheavy of a flavour, giving it a bitter after taste that I could not appreciate.\\n\\nI would only recommend this for those who value the experience to dine at your own pace while appreciating breathtaking views. To me, there was something special you couldn\\u2019t get from just experiencing CN Tower from the viewing gallery.\\n\\nAlso - I recommend going for the dinner and watch the beautiful view change from daylight to sunset to the night light up \\uD83D\\uDE0A\"",
            "CN Tower is a \\u201Dmust do\\u201D in Toronto, and since just riding up the tower is almost as expensive as getting a two course lunch menu, we decided to have lunch.\\n\\nViews are great, you get to see all of Toronto and far beyond. Sound level is unacceptably loud. Menu choices are ok, and dishes are served nicely, but staff seems to not really have time to check on your table often enough. My wife ordered a caffe latte to go with her dessert, unfortunately we had finished dessert by the time the coffee showed up.\\n\\nIt\\u2019s \\u201Dok\\u201D value for money to have lunch instead of just paying to ride up the tower, but if you want a good lunch there are plenty of better places.\"",
            "I recently had the opportunity to dine at the 360 CN Tower and I would like to share my experience. While the view was amazing, I regret to say that the overall experience was below average. \\n\\nFirstly, the food was disappointing. The taste was not amazing and it seemed as though the dishes were not fresh or cooked to order. In fact, it appeared that some of the food had been heated in a microwave, which greatly affected the quality and flavor.\\n\\nSecondly, the service was extremely poor. The waiters were impatient and inconvenient, constantly asking if we had finished our meal in an attempt to rush us to order the next dish. Furthermore, the waiters dropped plates on the table abruptly, creating a less than pleasant dining atmosphere. This level of service is not what one would expect in a good restaurant.\\n\\nLastly, the facilities were poorly maintained. The men's bathroom was dirty and had an unpleasant odor. Additionally, the cutlery provided was damaged and heavily scratched, indicating a lack of attention to detail and low-quality standards.\\n\\nTaking all these factors into consideration, I cannot recommend this restaurant. The food was not fresh or tasty, the service was far from satisfactory, and the overall experience was below average. \\n\\nHowever, I must acknowledge that the view from the restaurant was indeed amazing.\"",
            "To get a \\u2018Free\\u2019 ride up if you book the restaurant  with a minimum spend of \\u00A375 per person.  So not a cheap day but the views are amazing! Service fantastic whilst eating food was lovely!! Fresh lobsters and steak was really good. They do recommend 2 sides per person but the sides are huge so recommend 2 per couple. The only issue for me is you can go to the viewing deck after dinner but when you exit you join the normal queue for the lifts which is a bit annoying when you have just spent $600 on lunch\"",
            "Our Dinner with a view was a nice treat for our friends visiting from Ottawa.  Service wasn\\u2019t as good as we had remembered it but meal was well put together and everyone enjoyed.  Our bread was a bit stale (served before appetizers) but the rest of the meal fresh and flavourful.  Kids sundae came and was partially melting possibly because it was sitting before it came to our table.  Wished I had said something.  Our after dinner view was obstructed by clouds and we couldn\\u2019t see past the glass.  Too bad.  \"",
            "From the moment you walk in you are welcomed with quality customer service. I was not disappointed at all. First you have to make a reservation. I may have been 10 min late to mine and they still accepted me. \\n\\nWhen you first walk in just let them know you are there for the restaurant and that you have reservations. They will verbally direct you where to go. \\n\\nThere is coat check for free and an opportunity to take pictures that make it look like you are in front oh the CN tower. You will be able to view the pics when you are having your meal. \\n\\nFood\\nThe menu consist of 2 courses for $65 or 3 courses for $75. \\nI went with the 2 courses and ordered the duck salad and the Ontario chicken. I was very surprised how much I thoroughly enjoyed both. The portion sizes are decent because I ended up bringing home my leftovers. \\n\\nService\\nThe waitstaff were very professional. They constantly refilled our waters when they noticed we were running low and checked in on us at appropriate times. You do not have to tip but I tipped because I was very pleased with the service. \\n\\nAmbiance\\nNo all of the tables are by the widow. I was just lucky to get a window seat. I went at night at the city looked beautiful. When you are done eating you can go down 2 floors I believe and see Toronto. They also have glass floor tiles where you can see they you are standing over the city. You can also walk outside to view the city but it was too cold so I opted out. \\n\\nOverall\\nThis is a great experience. I would highly recommend others to partake in this experience.\"",
            "Highly overrated and underwhelming food. The view is great. Pay for that experience, but save your $$$ and eat elsewhere The prix fixe menu consisted on an appetizer\\u002Fsoup, an entree w\\u002Fveg and a dessert. That plus a glass of house wine and a beer was $300 Canadian . Service was ok, but you are definitely being hustled out so they can turn the tables. Apparently all the tourists locales are trying recoup their Covid losses in one season. All dining in Toronto is extremely expensive. I recommend getting to go meals from the local grocery stores and use you money on boat tours or experiences.\"",
            "What a super experience! The food was delicious! I opted for the Prix Fixe option and had the Roast prime rib of beef, was able to swap out the asparagus for green beans, and for dessert had the Chocolate Opera. The views- incredible. I booked at 7:15 and was given a window seat and was able to see the city during the day\\u002Fsunset and nighttime. Since I took the prix fixe option, I had free access to the observation deck- bonus! Amazing experience, really recommend!\"",
            "We decided to eat here as we wanted to visit the tower and this was a good way to do two things at once.  The dinner was really nice and the fixe price menu is only $20 more than the entrance price to the viewing deck.  I would recommend this as the way to go.  The view was spectacular as you would expect and the restaurant rotates so you get different views as your eating dinner.  Both our meals were good.  We shared charcuterie as a starter, I had a pasta with duck ragu and my husband had lamb shanks, finishing with the cheese board to share.  We didn't have wine, just opted for beer instead.  The service was good and the staff were very friendly.Everything was good and then you get to visit the viewing platform after your meal.\"",
            "Fantastic view at a heavy price. Tortoloni was a few under cooked  lumps filled with a tasteless paste for $65.00. Shrimp cocktail 3 pieces $45! . A few dishes were ok but with tip over $600 for 4 people I'd expect some first rate dining. Go for view on the observation deck then find a really good restaurant in Toronto and have 3 excellent dinners for the same amount. Service was pleasant about what you'd expect in a diner.\\n\\n \\n \"",

Could not fault a thing. I ordered off the a la carte menu though the prix fixe offered a number of interesting dishes. There was also an \\u2018indigenous menu\\u2019 which I was tempted by (but I don\\u2019t like gravlax) and was an interesting addition. \\n\\nFollowing lunch, you\\u2019re invited to head down to the observation platform but the views are way better from the restaurant. And you can also drop by the gift shop after for an eclectic range of quality souvenirs.\"",
            "I was there with a large group during a conference.\\nThis restaurant is packed full of people at long tables like spikes on a wheel, with little room to move in between. \\nAs a result, you feel like you have to lean in over the table for the waiters to get past you and you can feel them bump into you as they go past. You also feel a bit like you are packed in like animals at feed troughs.\\nThe service was rushed, and the servers not very attentive. I felt like they were pushing us to get out of there. They even had my table of colleagues move to another table so they could pack more people in despite the fact that our group had reserved that table.\\nWe had a prix fixe menu with 3 choices for the entr\\u00E9e: vegetarian risotto, salmon, or chicken. Those who had chicken said it was good, those who had salmon had overcooked salmon on undercooked kale with no sauce or seasoning, not even salt or pepper.\\nThose who had the risotto said it was inedible,  with crunchy undercooked rice and zero seasoning.\\nThe wine was horribly overpriced, I would say about 3 times the cost of a bottle at the liquor store. There was an automatic 18% gratuity added, and my friend was charged for a 9 ounce glass of wine rather than a 6 ounce glass, which was  what she ordered. Total wine cost to her:$40 for 1 glass of mediocre wine!!!\\nThe waiter kept arguing with her that he brought her a nine ounce glass, so she just gave in and paid it. I have never seen a glass of wine cost that much anywhere at any restaurant, even fine dining restaurants I have been at!\\nThe 3 course menu they offered our group was $90 pre tax and tip, also very overpriced for food that was mediocre at best, and completely inedible at worst.\\nI would recommend staying away from this restaurant. Despite the fantastic view, it does not make up for poor service and overpriced unseasoned poorly cooked food.\\nI would never recommend this to any one, when there are so many excellent restaurants in Toronto.\\nGo up to the top of the CN tower, look around and enjoy the view, then go somewhere else for dinner.\"",
            "Just looking for something to kill some time and saw and ad for fixed price lunch or dinner switch access to the CN Tower and viewing platform included if you spend $75 each. I made reservations for the next day. The tower was a short walk from the InterContinental Hotel. Basically a separate line and elevator for the 360\\u00B0 restaurant which opened at 1130 avoidingthe long lines for the viewing tower.  Great 8 oz filet meal served with 2 baked potatoes because they were small, ha! ha! Normal size.  Blueberry old fashioned was excellent after I smashed the blueberries which they should have muddled. After eating, we were directed to a staircase to get to the viewing platform.   We didn't really need to do this because the view from our table as it rotated was just as good.  \"",
            "My significant other and I visited the 360 Restaurant in the CN Tower for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  I was looking into visiting the CN Tower for viewing\\u002Fgeneral admission, however when I discovered you can make a reservation for lunch or dinner, and if you order the Prix Fixe menu option, you receive entry to the tower included \\u2013 this seemed like a much better deal!  I am so happy I chose this option, as we were able to have a delicious lunch with fantastic service and a beautiful view, for a reasonable amount more than just entry to the CN Tower.  I would HIGHLY recommend this option.  \\n\\nI was able to make a reservation easily on the CN Tower website a few weeks in advance, and upon our arrival we were whisked to a separate elevator with no line or wait, which took us to the 360 Restaurant.  We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation, however we were seated right away with a table next to the windows as I had requested when I made the reservation.  We enjoyed a relaxing and quiet lunch during the 72 minutes it takes for the restaurant to make a full revolution.  \\n\\nThe service was phenomenal throughout the meal.  The menu was very extensive with so many great-looking options.  The focus on local\\u002FCanadian cuisine was fun for us as this was our first visit to Toronto, especially the Indigenous Menu choices.  We opted for the Prix Fixe selection of 2 courses, and chose the following: \\n\\nAppetizers: \\nHot Smoked Fraser River White Sturgeon \\u2013 perfectly cooked fish, great flavor combinations.\\nCanadian Seafood Stew \\u2013 delicious, creamy, and full of perfectly cooked seafood (no skimping here!)\\n\\nMains: \\nRoasted King Cole Duck Breast \\u2013 perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy.  The accompaniments were great; the polenta, greens, and black currant jus were wonderful together. \\nCanadian Red Deer \\u2013 Filet & Sausage \\u2013 again, PERFECTLY cooked filet, and delicious sausage.\\n\\nWith the two courses, we were full by the end of the meal.  As it was my significant other\\u2019s birthday weekend, he was even surprised with a (complimentary) birthday dessert!  \\n\\nWe did try a couple of local craft beers off of the extensive drink menu, which although was mostly focused on wines (the highest wine cellar in the world!), had plenty for us beer drinkers and other NA options (the coffee was great, too).  \\n\\nI would highly recommend indulging in a visit to the 360 Restaurant, especially for a special occasion.  It was a delicious and relaxing meal, with fantastic views and service.  You won\\u2019t regret splurging \\u2013 especially when you take the restaurant-only elevator down to the other viewing floors and realize how crowded and loud the rest of the tower can be.  Thank you to the employees of the 360 Restaurant for a wonderful experience, which was a highlight of our trip to Toronto.\"",
            "Visited here last night for my birthday dinner with my wife and family . I have to say the view out was blinding , could see for miles . Now for the restaurant! It\\u2019s very expensive fir what it is, don\\u2019t get me wrong the food was nice but not worth the prices . The drinks were overpriced aswell & beer selection was poor! As for the waiters and expecting tips of around \\u00A360 I thought that was a bit of a liberty . I can understand tipping but when they ask for a minimum of 15% it works out a lot . Would go there again for the view but not for the restaurant.\"",

If we booked earlier than 5 days in advance we might have been able to see the sunset.  My wife and I ordered the 3 course Prix Fixe meal, and our daughter had the same from the children\\u2019s menu.  We loved the Wedge Salad, mussels, Pork Chop, chicken, Chocolate Mousse, and ice cream.  Beautiful views of the city and lake on the slow rotating platform.  Access to the viewing tower as well.

            "A Must Visit\\u2026When You Are In Toronto! If you want to celebrate that special day, the 360 restaurant on top of the CN Tower is the place to be. Good food, a fine dining experience and a breath taking view is what defines this place.\\nThe food is good (some people with dietary restrictions might feel that options are limited, especially if you are a vegetarian), and the portion size is pretty good. If you go for the prix fix menu, you would be pretty full at the end. Some might say that the place is a little pricey, and it is, but if you count in the fact that the CN tower admission (Almost a $40 value per head) is included in it, it doesn\\u2019t feel that expensive then.\\nThe most unique thing about the restaurant is that it is slowly rotating giving you a full 360 view of the city (hence the name) and nothing can beat it.\\n\\nPro Tip \\u2013 Try to make a reservation for a table at around sunset. You would get an amazing view of the city in the daylight, sunset and night!\"",
            "I visited 360 Restaurant with a friend in November 2022 to celebrate her belated birthday.  The view was fantastic, the food was delicious and every server and other staff member we encountered was professional, friendly, efficient and helpful.  I would highly recommend 360 Restaurant for a special occasion or a fun night out.\"",
            "Given the price of the items on the menu, I was expecting slightly more. The view and the building itself were great, however the food and the service was hit and miss. \\n\\nTo start we had prawn cocktail and the chowder. Both were ok, although I would tend to expect more than 3 prawns for $35. The mains again were ok, the steak was cooked very well, although the noodles accompanying the salmon dish were slightly burnt. The host was nice and friendly, as was the chap who gave us some water, although the main waiter himself wasn\\u2019t quite as friendly and showed no real interest in engaging with us outside of taking our order. \\n\\nIf this exact experience had been at a standard chain restaurant it probably would have got an extra star, but I felt that given the reputation and price point it should have been slightly better. There are plenty of other restaurants in Toronto that offer better food, better value, and better service, but not with quite as spectacular view.\"",

The staff are helpful and efficient.\\n\\nIt is difficult to get good photos as the windows reflect so much so drink it all into your memory.

Then when our meals came out he didn't offer Parmasean or Pepper or ask how the meal was going (I heard other servers doing it at other tables, so I guess we just got a dud?) \\n\\nOverall, I think if you live in the neighbourhood it's a decent restaurant at a decent price, but don't go here expecting the best food in town.

            "I almost hate to write this review because the place is so popular as it is, it's hard to get a table ;-).  Tucked away at what used to be a fairly rundown part of Toronto West, there is a strip of restaurants that are just simply surprising.  And head and shoulders and elbows above them all is Lavinia.  \\n\\nI used to live in Spain for a few years and the smell that hits you as you open the door smelled like 'home'.  The first time we went was at like 6 on a WEDNESDAY, it was fully booked.  So during the week, you can book on Open Table but Friday and through the weekend, you have to call.  We went up a few doors to the Tich indian.  But that's another review.\\n\\nWe went this past weekend for my birthday.  It was FULL.  It is a small establishment with about 20 seats.  As soon as a table was vacated, it was seated again... or so it seemed.  The place is spotless and the staff well appointed.  You would almost forget you were in Mimico.  The minute you leave your seat your napkin is refolded.  On my way to the services in the back I cross paths with a waiter who stopped to open the door and turn on the light.  Just little touches like that.  The staff were knowledgeable  of the food and aware of the whole room.  If someone's water was empty, the nearest waiter would refill.  It wasn't a 'that's not my station' operation.  \\n\\nThe chef comes out to check and briefly chat with people.  He even helped me on with my coat as I left.  But I am getting ahead of myself...... \\n\\nThe glorious food.  We had alot of food because of the trendiness of the term Tapas, in North America, it gets abused.  So you never know if you are actually going to get pinxos (pinchos), a couple of bites.  But these were proper tapas, unlike at over hyped Patria.  \\n\\nWe had the Boquerones, white housemade anchovies with Manchego.  These are not the anchovies that haters who don't like the salted cured and oil preserved pizza anchovies, which I adore as well.  But these are fresh small filets that are 'cooked' in vinagre and served with a very nice olive oil.  We did have a tempranillo with it though.  While the wine was lovely, the Veo Veo, and we wanted a middle of the road wine, because we ordered a variety, it clashed with the Boquerones.  So if you get them, and you should, have a white wine or beer.  Or just set aside your red wine while you're eating them.\\n\\nWe then had the special of the evening, of stuffed piquillo peppers with a bacalau (salt cod) mousse.  It had what I think was a cashew based sauce.  Amazing.  \\n\\nWe had the Octopus (Pulpo).  Ok, I cannot stress enough how SPECTACULAR this dish was.  I have had alot of pulpo in a variety of cuisines.  And here and in spain and hands down, this was the most tender and well cooked octopus I have had in my life.  Cooked perfectly that it did not feel slimey nor rubbery.  It melted in your mouth.  The paprika'd oil, we practically ate with a spoon. This was also a proper serving too.  We had the rubbery pulpo at Patria, downtown and it came with an inappropriately large hunk of a potato and maybe 3 pieces of octopus.  \\n\\nWe had the croquetas de cangrejo or crab croquettes.  Full of lovely crabmeat and not filler.  It was a touch on the salty side but my hubbo didn't think so.  It came with a luxurious aioli.  \\n\\nWe then had a Arroz Negro for one but after all the tapas it was more than sufficient for the two of us.  Unlike in the other more trendy 'tapas' or 'small plates' restaurants, the staff will recommend an appropriate amount of food.  I find that Patria and Portland tend to try to encourage over ordering also their plates are basically a couple of bites.\\n\\nThe Arroz Negro is my favourite form of paella (pie-aya) please don't pronounce the ll's.  It just isn't right.  It's not like people pronounce the l in chalk or walk.  Just learn, it's not how you say it.  The very nice table next to us kept calling it pie-ella.  ack.  It is a rice dish made with the ink from the squid so it is, eponymously black.  It is cooked with Calamari and Clams.  cooked again to tender perfection.  I had no shame in scraping the pan. :D.  \\n\\nI don't know what took me so long to go here.  The kitchen is run by the couple owners and I believe their son runs front of house.  It's a lovely place and worth the uber ride to the west end.\"",

            "The endless glowing reviews and the extraordinary high ranking by tripadvisor caused us to go to LaVinia Restaurant recently. \\nWe were greeted charmingly and taken to a table near the back of the simple but pleasant enough room. From our viewpoint we saw the whole room. The servers were strikingly amiable and genial as they moved about the room. Clients were charmed.\\nWe ordered from the tapas menu. White anchovies were quite tasty.(16.75) The portion was small. The Veal Carpaccio with Manchego and Mushrooms (18.75) looked very nice spread out on the plate. It was sliced so thinly however that there was very little there when it came to eating it. The Grilled Calamari with Chilli oil, (15.75) were mushy. My wife wouldn't eat hers after the first bite. I ate half of mine. Next, Spanish Chorizo Saut\\u00E9ed with Clams and White Beans. (16.75.) Tasty, but felt tired and reheated. Finally, Baked Spinach with Goat Cheese. (16.75)  Some wilted spinach leaves with a piece of mild warmed cheese. Dull. Flavorless. Because of the endless effusive reviews I expected something special from these dishes. A chef's touch. But it was all rather ordinary. And given the portions and the pricing, not worth it.\\nBut the real concern came with trying to order wine. Our waiter gushed that the owner and his son import there own special wines directly from Spanish producers. We ordered a Spanish white for $60.00. It arrived in a bottle with a label that said Tempranillo. For those unfamiliar with that grape, it is RED. The waiter brushed that off saying the winery made a mistake. \\\"The wine was white after all\\\". He assured us it was very good. For 30 years my wife ran a wine importing company. We are both quite practiced at evaluating wine quality. My wife sent hers back after one taste. It was of very low quality. We cancelled the bottle and had a glass of something else that was also of indifferent quality.  I estimate that, that $60.00 bottle would have cost them very little. The mark up was clearly excessive.  I noted that one of the earlier reviewers commented on their unreasonable charge for Sangria. Surprisingly few reviewers make any comments on the wines.Perhaps they just don't understand.\\nBy offering wines that are privately sourced, their clients are totally in the dark on the  cost. I believe they are selling low level wines, and gouging on their mark ups.\\nBut the wine service does have lots of flourish and charm.\\nSo what is the miracle? Well the endless gushy reviews and ratings they manage to produce, from what is essentially a rather ordinary restaurant. This restaurant has been hugely over rated in the trip adviser rankings. Toronto has many many excellent restaurants. Lavinia is not one of them and should be ranked much lower than it is. It is an example of style succeeding over substance.\"",

The family of staff are very friendly, offer amazing suggestions and are very passionate to share their culture.   \\nMust try: Gin and Tonic..... you will be amazed!\\nThe chef makes his regular visits to the dining room and is greated with compliments from each table (ours included).\\nLooking forward to my next visit.  Reservations already made!\"",
            "We had every intention of having LaVinia`s famous paella with wine last night and instead left for another restaurant. That`s what poor service can do. I`m sure the food is as TripAdvisor says is, but I will never know as we didn`t stay to order anything - and will never return. if your server doesn`t greet you with a smile, if he answers curtly and seems to not want your business, never take it. Leave as we did. Go to where you know has great service for all. In a city with almost limitless tasty world cuisine, reward those that treat you and people of all hues well.\"",
            "Great dining experience . Service was excellent. Food outstanding, I recommend Chico with white beans appetizer. Paella was delicious. Osso Bucco was wonderful. Highly recommend this restaurant.\\n\"",
            "We celebrated my birthday last night with a group of 8 and had a wonderful experience at La Vinia. The food is delicious and truly authentic Spanish cuisine. Chef Fernando does a great job along with his staff, to make it a truly enjoyable experience, reminiscent of meals enjoyed in Spain. We enjoyed the paella\\u2019s, fiduea, and the grilled calamari were done to perfection, and for desert, the chocolate flan was light and flavourful!  A gem in Mimico and we will definitely return.\"",

            "On a non descript part of lakeshore in a strip mall this restaurant is a gem.   \\n\\nChef Fernando and his family run this Spanish restaurant and it is superb\\n\\nPaella was superb.  Fried milk for dessert unexpectedly excellent \\n\\nAlready discovered by locals it was full on a Friday night \\n\\n\"",
            "We visited last night and we had a wonderful dinner experience. The staff were wonderful, friendly, very tentative, and very professional. The owner of the restaurant comes out to talk to the customers and check if everyone is ok so often. We arrived 10 min before our reservation as we were traveling from Mississauga and we were afraid there was traffic therefore our table wasn\\u2019t ready yet the owner came out personally to apologize and to tell us that our table will be ready soon. The food was delicious and for the first time ever I never asked for salt, pepper etc. It was perfect. We had 3 appetizers ( grilled calamari, the sausage and the veal) our favourite was the veal but they were all fantastic we eat everything even the sauce. I can\\u2019t say enough about that restaurant. It was great to have a great dinner experience in a restaurant that knows very well how to make customers happy and to make sure they return. Can\\u2019t wait to go back. \"",
            "LaVinia is one of the few restaurants in Toronto offering authentic Spanish fare. It was highly recommended by the hotel concierge. \\n\\nLaVinia is a cozy restaurant with wooden interiors and red-painted walls much like the Spanish flag. The staff was nice and quick to seat us.

            "If you live in Etobicoke you do not have to travel downtown Toronto in order to find a nice and authentic Spanish restaurant. Just come to LaVinia. It's a beautiful cozy restaurant located on Lake Shore Blvd. West: three minutes walk to lake Ontario and not very far from Birds & Beans Coffee shop and Kothur Indian Cuisine restaurant.\\n\\nThe owner of this place is a  professional chef from Spain. The appetizers and paellas  were really delicious. Their selection of Spanish wines was amazing. Their sea products are always fresh and of high quality.\\n\\nThere was a warm atmosphere in the restaurant. I highly  recommend visiting this place.\"",
            "To anyone who\\u2019s been to Spain or simply crave good food, wine, and atmosphere then you must go to LaVinia!\\n\\nLaVinia is currently ranked 12th on TripAdvisor, an amazing accomplishment considering just how many outstanding restaurants there are in Toronto (there are 2 \\u00BD times as many restaurants per person in Toronto then in New York City). But I'd rank it still higher! \\n\\nThe food: salmon carpaccio, garlic shrimp; Flamenca salad and a salad special with blue cheese and pears; paella Valenciana and grilled trout; cr\\u00E8me brulee, Spanish coffee, cappuccino, and Spanish brandy. It all was wonderful! The paella was the best I\\u2019ve had outside of Spain!\\n\\nThe service: I\\u2019ve never seen six people work so hard! The kitchen is small, probably smaller then the one in your home, one cook and assistant, husband and wife, cooking food with grace and style for at least 32 (one sitting). Watching the wait staff of three running around reminded of a favorite scene in movie Ratatouille except these three were NOT wearing roller-skates)) \\n\\nDinner at LaVinia was one of the most memorable experiences of my life. Frankly, it was better then Sevilla in New York, and Taberna del Alabardero or Jaleo in Washington D.C., three of only four or five restaurants in North America at this level! \\n\\nThe owners, Fernando, Maria, and Jaime are truly the soul of Spain! Bravo!\"",
            "LaVinia is one of the few restaurants in Toronto offering authentic Spanish fare. My wife and I came here for our anniversary and I have been craving for a good Paella. The last restaurants we tried in New York, Sevilla was okay but did not fare enough to what I was used to. Having Basque friends who do catering, I became familiar on what to look out for in Spanish cuisine and since then have on the search for a great, tasty Paella. \\n\\nLaVinia is cozy restaurant with wooden interiors and red-painted walls much like the Spanish flag. The staff was nice and quick to seat us. We were handed the menu and my wife and I ordered the sopa de ajo, paella valenciana and the fish of the day.\\n\\nSince I do not eat pork, I requested if they can cook it in utensils that have not been with used with the said ingredient and they were very respectful. Fernando, the chef and owner, even came to assure me that it's nothing to worry about. \\n\\nThe first to come was the sopa de ajo and it was warm, creamy and not overwhelming in its garlic taste. The paella soon came after and after one bite, I was hooked. This was the paella that I had been looking for, perfectly cooked bomba rice, juicy and moist chicken and the hint of saffron. It was divine and felt like the first time I had an authentic homecooked paella years back. The fish of the day was surprisingly good. I mean after having Paella, my standards for flavour were now higher but its taste took me by surprise. It was perfectly cooked and the fish retained its moisture with a simple, clean taste and yet, good.\\n\\nLast we had was the tartufo and it was okay but at this point, I was not complaining. I did not come here for desserts anyway. It was the paella that we came here for and finally found one close by.\\n\\nWe could not finish the large portions, so we ended up bringing them home to my kids. As soon as we got home, my son smelled the paella and next thing I knew, it was cleaned off and he was asking me when we could order from LaVinia again. We're definitely coming here again.\\n\\nThank you, Fernando and your staff, for making our anniversary a memorable one.\"",
            "Love the food as it is very authentic as to what Spanish food should be. I highly recommend this place.\"",
            "So my friends and I have been coming to LaVinia a few years now and they have been delivering consistent fantastic service and delicious food.  We had the crab croquettas, lamb shank, goat cheese with spinach and a few of the shrimp dishes.   I\\u2019ve tried most of the dishes over the years and they have been consistent in its flavor and scrumptiousness.  You will definitely find yourself grabbing that piece of bread and sopping up some of the sauce cuz it\\u2019s just that good!!\\n\\nIt is a small family run business with Chef Fernando in the back with his wife and Jaime his son in the front.\\n\\nIt is authentic, warm and familial place where  there is no rush to turn tables.\\n\\nJust go!  Seriously..just go!\\n\\n\"",
            "Love the food as it is very authentic as to what Spanish food should be.  octopus and anchovy\\u2019s were awesome and the best I\\u2019ve had on this side of the Med.

            "My cousin took my son and I  to his friend's restaurant for dinner. Outside was -24 degrees and it was not surprising that the restaurant was almost empty. We were delightfully surprised! Everything served at this Authentic Italian restaurant was made right there at the establishment...from scratch. A family run business where 'recipe secrets' are being passed down through the ages. This is a Gem that is a must to explore!\""

I admit that I am no food expert, but some of the combinations were unusual and yet worked incredibly! My husband and I were so impressed.

            "We hadn't visited Alo since before COVID and were excited to return. We knew we would be seated in the bar area, and the table, though small, was well spaced and the chairs comfortable. The  menu, the same as in the main room was 6 courses. The food lived up to the michelin star. It was imaginative, varied and tastefully presented. We enjoyed each course. \\n\\nBut the experience wasn't perfect. No one offered to take our coats. One of the forks was bent and we had to ask for another.  From being seated to getting the check took exactly 75 minutes, which didn't feel like we were dining.  Each course came out too quickly and we felt that the kitchen had rushed us. \\n\\nBut the biggest disappointment were the wine pairings. The wine was average at best with nothing new or exciting. The sommelier splashed the wine into the glasses, gave a rote description and didn't wait around until we tasted.  The selection was certainly not michelin star quality. \\n\\nAll in all, Chef Kriss presented a meal that didn't disappoint but there's still work to be done to live up to the Michelin star experience.\"",
            "My husband diligently hovered over the computer to get a reservation near to my birthday once they were released and yay, he got one!  The evening was lovely but, perhaps not quite up to the extreme hype.  The atmosphere is great - modern yet cozy and comfortable.  The bar area is beautiful and they have cleverly added seating by putting cushions on the wide window sills.  Not bad considering where you are sitting!  The cocktails are excellent and quickly delivered.  The main dining area is open and airy and the staff are for the most part friendly, knowledgeable  and unobtrusive.  The food is very good.  I very much liked most of it, was underwhelmed by some of it and loved a couple of dishes.  The wine pairings were all excellent.  This tasting menu is NOT for those who do not enjoy fish.  It was all fresh and beautifully presented but, didn't have a wow factor.  The fluke lacked flavour despite the description of jalapeno, and the salmon was basic.  The lobster was very nice; tender pieces and flavourful but again, not really imaginative.  The duck and veal were lovely dishes and the chocolate desserts were great.  We had a wonderful evening but then again, I can have a wonderful evening at home or at the Keg.  I wanted extraordinary and didn't really get that. Perhaps Alinea and Grant Achatz have ruined me for other tasting menus!  \"",
            "I believe this is considered the best restaurant in Canada, and I completely agree with this. Every attention to detail is paid. The food, the staff, the sommelier were all absolutely wonderful. The ambiance is pleasant and beautiful as well. We sat at the bar in front of the chefs cooking our meal; a dinner and a show! Tried several items I\\u2019ve never had before and loved every single course. Would highly recommend for any foodies out there.\"",
            "We booked a reservation well in advance and it is worth it. Outstanding service at all levels. True professionals and it shows. Wine pairings were fantastic. Tasting menu was incredible.

Quite simply, one of the best dining experiences you\\u2019ll ever have in Toronto, and in Canada! Ranked one of the best restos in the world too \\uD83D\\uDE4C  Blind tasting menus are an art and they never get it wrong. You will be wowed from beginning to end. Worth the wait to get in for a seating!\"",
            "I admire restaurant reviewers , my favourite is Giles Coren , how do you make sense of some of the experiences you have just been through. He manages it with humour and sharp observation. I will do my best here.\\n\\nSo we finally did Alo. Everyone drones on about how difficult it is to get in. It's not that bad , just need to have signed up to Tock reservation system and be ready at 10 am on the designated day every couple of months. You then have to move fairly fast and pick a date and time that comes up and book fast.\\n\\nYou enter a what looks like an a scruffy apartment block and take lift up. We had chosen the tasting menu at the bar\\u002F chefs rail and also chose to do the wine pairing. Once seated things are fairly brisk. We made the mistake of ordering a glass of champagne to start things off. Two issues here as the champagne was corked and it messed with their system as wine pairing selections starting stacking up quickly.\\nThe wine pairing was interesting for a while and some of the wines were unusual. However there was an issue , with one exception there were all white. I think there are enough interesting red wines out there that would pair with the food offered.To have glass after glass of white wine does get a bit boring.\\n\\nSo let's talk about the food. Goodness, how much effort must it take the prep the seeming endless courses with the accompanying sauces , reductions and pretty bits. When you think about the effort ,anything you pay is a bargain even at their healthy prices. Everything was delicious . My favourite was the oyster dish and the potato dish. I could have licked the plate clean to get every last drop of whatever yumminess made up the dish. Here's the issue I was never sure exactly what everything actually was . More on that shortly. My wife particularly liked the scallop dish.\\n\\nSo sitting at the chefs rail you are faced with two particular views. Firstly the poor souls assembling all the dishes. It must get a bit boring spending all evening shouting \\\"Oui chef \\\"obediently as the orders are called out , assembling order after order of the same thing. However they do a fine job. Once prepared the food gets sent to the pass. Three chefs are present there who do final tweaks and inspections before they go out. Occasionally chef owner Patrick Kriss  comes, out all steely eyed then disappears again. I wonder where he goes . His office to check reviews , thinking up next dishes or kicks back to watch Raptors on his office TV ? \\n\\nSo to the service. Lots of reviews suggest the restaurant would win a Michelin star if an inspector deigned to visit Canada. Who knows maybe they do already but can't find any restaurant to award a star to . In case they do visit I am not so sure Alo would get a star as whilst the food is very good , a more complete experience would probably be needed.\\n \\nSo here is the issue for me , a variety of servers bang out your food and rush through a mumbled explanation of what you are about to eat by rote. Poor souls they have repeated it a thousand times , however I gave up up asking for things to be repeated as i could not keep doing that for every single course. When you add that to the gang of three at the pass in their own private world the atmosphere feels a bit cold at times.\\n\\nSo to be constructive here is my suggestion based on some top restaurants I have been lucky enough to go to. Key is a bit more banter between staff and guests. Gang of three could perhaps have some quick chats with guests at chefs rail. They seem to have some spare time when they spin their ever ready tweezers around and shoot the breeze. Example is Canoe chef's rail. Chefs have a laugh and a chat with guests at chefs rail and bring a morsel not expected to try. Marcus , London UK , servers have elegant but personal chat with customers that feels an  unrushed yet interested chat about the food you are about to receive. See also Smyth Chicago, apart from stunning food , sommeliers balances wine pairing much better , even leave pairing bottle on table if you want to try more before they bring next one. In reality you can only drink so much so few people over do it. Go really fancy and visit Ritz restaurant in London , yet even there serving team seem to be able to find a good balance of friendly chat with informed and interesting explanation about food you are being served.\\n\\nSo here is the key question , would I go back ? Probably yes , but not at chef's rail and at a table with fewer courses and my own choice of wine. \\n\\nGreat place, especially for Canada , so near yet so far from a true Michellin starred restaurant if that matters to anyone , probably not !\"",
            "This was a fun date night but I am going to critical because Michelin stars are around the corner.\\n1. The restaurant is located in Spadina, not a very glamorous welcome. The elevator looks like the service elevator and really needs to be updated. \\n2. Press 3 and you head up to the restaurant. \\n3. The bar was very nice , perfect for a date night as we were having. Hooks for handbags for the ladies, nice glass wear, a nice atmosphere. \\n\\n4. The menu is self explanatory. The cocktails, I think I chose wrong as mine tasted like cough syrup. Not too much finesse in the cocktail preparation, having just finished a long euro trip, I think the creativity could be further explored and the bartender spilt and remixed my drink twice before even serving it. \\n5. We chose the wine paired menu, now this is my real bone of contention. \\nA) the red paired with the most beautifully prepared  beef tenderloin almost ruined the taste. I know it\\u2019s summer but they need to change the red wine pairing. I took two sips and left the rest. My husband asked for a change and the Syrah was equally disappointing. \\nB) the scallops were delicious but again disappointingly paired with wine. The pop corn flavoured rice, was odd but different. I still enjoyed it \\nC) a Sauterne would have paired much better with that elegant fois gras (probably the most amazing preparation you have ever tasted ) \\nFor such high standard and quality of food the wine was sub par and perhaps there needs to be two wine menus, a sommeliers selection and a premier choice and the sommelier should be able to pour 2-3 oz of wine exact, it alway looks very bad when a sommelier pours one glass higher that the other person consistently through 6 courses. \\n\\nService ; the waiters seemed new and nervous, dropping cutlery and not impeccable. The table was only wiped after the steak. \\n\\nI enjoy fine dining and we would definitely return for another date. However I would be more vocal about my preference to the wine list.\\n\\nPerhaps maybe encourage a dress code. It\\u2019s so awkward being sat all dressed up and then flip flops and shorts sit right next to your table.\"",

            "I visited in November 2019 with family. With the abundance of good restaurants in Toronto, I may be biased to write that Alo was very good, but not anything special. \\n\\nThe menu was Asian fusion inspired. Something was missing in the taste of many of the dishes, although I can\\u2019t put my finger on what it is - perhaps cohesiveness. Each course very thoughtfully laid out and creative. The service was second to none in Toronto. Probably the best tasting restaurant right now in Toronto by a hair overall. \\n\\nI would still recommend for others to try.\"",
            "Im A long time Toronto resident who dines out and entertains clients. My 75+ client phoned to make a reservation for 4pm. Yorkville location. Discovered they opened @4:30 so asked for reservations for 2. Was told he had to make it online and that they couldn\\u2019t seat him for 4:30 but possibly 4:45   He arrives a few minutes early to be told they had no record of reservation. It was for the patio. He was told they probably couldn\\u2019t accommodate him. The patio was empty. After saying really??? They did. I arrived with my 14lb 14inches tall service dog - it was brutally hot day and I took my water glass and let her have a sip. That\\u2019s when all hell broke lose. The waiter rudely walked away and then someone else suddenly appeared. He didn\\u2019t introduce himself I was informed that they don\\u2019t allow a dog to drink from a water glass. When I asked if they don\\u2019t wash there glasses after people drink from them. He looked at me as if I was an idiot and said of course we do. As we tried to salvage what was to be a lovely afternoon on an outdoor cafe our waiter continued his arrogant behavior. I waitressed all thru University - I\\u2019m 66- but always remember it\\u2019s a tough job. And have always been a very generous tipper. I explained that to the waiter as I paid our bill. And why I was leaving nothing. I haven\\u2019t done that in decades. His rudeness continued. Alo what happened to you !!!!!\"",

We had been gifted with a generous certificate to this restaurant and finally  made use of it last night.Despite being a weeknight in the midst of a snow event, I was surprised that it was so busy - that is until after I tasted the food. The meal definitely lived up to the hype and the service was flawless as well.  In fact, it is impossible for me to find anything to criticize. Some of the dishes were more enjoyable than others but the tasting menu provided opportunities to enjoy a wide variety of flavours and featured ahi tuna, lobster, and waygu beef.

            "Ever since ALO first opened its door to the delight of the culinary world, awards and accolades from authoritative members of the restaurant critic community had been flooding in. Riding the back of this media frenzy, avid gourmands and food bloggers from near and far, flocked to eat at this revered gastronomic temple. Their pilgrimage and experiences resulted in the saturation of some of the most popular food blogging space with rave reviews and postings, filled with \\u2018Oohs & Aahs\\u2018\\u2026\\u2026.from 290+ reviews on Yelp, to 570+ on Tripadvisor and a whopping 1370+ reviews on Google!! All these, put ALO on a pedestal as being the most followed and reviewed fine-dining establishment in Toronto and all of Canada!\\n\\nBecoming the hottest table in town and best restaurant in Canada four years running also put ALO on the same \\u2018Toughest restaurant reservation in the world\\u2018 map. An elite landscape that includes gastro-icons like Noma, Mirazur, Fat Cat, Quintessence\\u2026etc! As well, this new found fame quickly propelled ALO into Sam Pellegrino\\u2019s World Best 100 Restaurant list. At #90, ALO, a Canadian restaurant, can now rub shoulder with some of the renowned global multi-stars Michelin stalwarts\\u2026\\u2026. Lung King Heen 3*(88), Sushi Saito 3*(91), Per Se 3*(115), Ann-Sophie Pic 3*(98), Martin Berasategu 3* (87), David Toutain 2*(108) to name a few\\u2026.. making it even more of a challenge to get a priced table there!\\n\\nAs if the almighty above was smiling down on me and giving me a helping hand? Last week, I managed to secure an ultra rare \\u2018last minute cancellation\\u2019 reservation for my wife and myself, just a day or two shy of a very special occasion, which we were hoping to celebrate jointly!\\n\\nThe outcome of this \\u2018miracle\\u2019 was the encounter of the most epic and pleasurable meal I have had in Canada for a long, long while! To paraphrase a remark made by another knowledgeable and trusted foodie of another long-standing food blog...\\u201C If there is a better restaurant in Canada? Someone please let me know! \\u201C!\\n\\nOverall, I would like to start by commenting that, after a long two years wait, I finally encountered once again, a phenomenal meal with components and dish that not only wowed but in a couple of cases left me speechless! Playful, whimsical and visually appealing dishes started to arrive on the get go and did not stop till the very end! The majority of courses were perfectly balanced and seasoned, creating deep, complex sauces and sensational, memorable taste bombs. In addition, the stirring textural interplay of ingredients created some of the most enjoyable and wonderful, multi-dimensional mouth-feel!\\n\\nA glorious union of French cuisine with well infused Japanese influence and skillfully combining classical approach with the occasional modern touch!....truly masterful touches by a talented Chef and his team!\\n\\nSome of the outstanding 'stars of the evening' include the following:\\n\\n1) Amuse Bouche - A playful start to the meal that reminded me of similar experiences I had at the 3* Pierre Gagnaire in Paris and Hong Kong. The Japanese Musk melon ( so fragrant, sweet and juicy ) and Jamon Iberico de Bellota ( sweet and umami saturated ) were rare priced foodie offering.\\n2) Toro Tartlette - First of at least a handful of 'wow-worthy ' dishes. The Toro bits gorgeously dressed, the shell, delicate and crisp. Great mouth feel!\\n3) Hokkaido Uni cream mousse - OMG! This was so xxxxx good, I asked my wife if I could lick the dish!\\n4) Seared East coast scallops with corn and crab bisque - This must be the best scallop dish I have eaten in Canada, period! Perfectly cooked to medium rare and oozing with amazing aroma, the crispy exterior morsels was paired with an intricate and dense crab bisque. Absolutely delectable to the Nth degree!\\n5) Amadai ( Tile-Fish ) with crispy skin - for me, this was the 'big bang' of the entire meal! The super delicate, crispy scales (created by pouring boiling oil on them) formed a dynamic combo with the tasty, moist and delicate flesh. The addition of the tasty creamy sauce took it way over the top! Wow!!!\\n\\nIMHO, the desserts were the weak spot of the entire, otherwise, perfect meal. A slight beefing-up would be nice?!\\n\\nMatching the 10+ courses epicurean delights was the top-notched service. Professional, efficient, attentive and super-friendly. Covid safety protocol was strictly adhered to. Chef Kriss even took some time to come out from his busy kitchen to greet me and say \\u2018Hi\\u2019\\n\\nBTW, that Special Occasion I eluded to?!........Yours truly\\u2019s \\u2018Ruby\\u2019 Wedding Anniversary Celebration\"",
            "Wow!  We left hungry two years ago, but definitely not this time! This restaurant has fine tuned a creative tasting menu, excellent wine pairings (along with a suggestion that we try eating and drinking at the same time...try it!), and friendly, professional staff.  Definitely an exceptional special occasion place!\"",
            "Highly recommend the wine and food pairings tasting menu. The portions are tiny - literally a bite or two; I am not a big eater and was actually full after all the courses and had to give my husband some of my wine as well. However if you are the type that needs a plate of food this may not be for you. You can order a meal at the bar instead. If you are a \\\"foodie\\\" this is a \\\"must try\\\".  Not cheap but worth treating yourself.\\n\\nReservations have to be amde at least 6 months in advance so plan well.\\n\\nI also suggest not driving yourselves there as someone has to drive home after drinking.  We got a ride there and took a cab home.\"",
            "Alo is everything you hear or read about. Fantastic food and thoughtful service in a comfortable unassuming room. Really enjoyed every minute and course of our meal.\"",
            "Five star food and service without the pretentious white glove and table clothes. The 3 hour service flew by.  We were presented with on point details about each dish, and wine pour which added to the experience. Cutlery, and glasses were changed with each plate.  We thoroughly enjoyed every dish and appreciated the attention and care the service team provided us with.  I would highly recommend Alo for a special occasion.  \"",
            "Read your reservation carefully. Bar room and the main dining room. bar room was a let down experience, if I understood that in my reservation I would have never booked the bar room. Did not compare to our other Michelin star restaurant (David Toutain) we visited. Staff was lovely and nice. Realizing my booking is not what I thought, I asked to be move to the diningroom. No room. Asked if I could have the ten course meal. Said it wasn\\u2019t possible due to our seating in the bar area. Sitting very disappointing across from the bar next to the washroom with a sliding door open and shutting the whole dinner. Lighting too dark to see our food and then light shining from the window to see street of Spadina, off putting and not being able to see partner sitting across from me. Bar noises plus the cappuccino machine going off all through our dinner. \\nMeals were over salted to the point two courses were not easy to eat. Noise level very loud. Both of us were unwell, feeling after dinner, possibly from the from the sturgeon caviar amuse bouche. Husband and I noted at the time it was warm not cold. Dessert was ok. \\nNot the experience we had waited for so long to have. \\nMy fault need to do more research. Again staff was nice. \"",
            "Alo is not a restaurant.... Chef Kriss has created his own little world and you feel it the moment you walk into the restaurant. You feel like you've walked into the Alo world and you just don't want to leave!!!\\n\\nEvery single course was outstanding! The wine pairing is a must (in my opinion). It makes the meal slightly more expensive compared to ordering a bottle of wine... but so worth out. It's next to impossible to get a reservation here so might as well enjoy the experience to the fullest! \\nThe chef's understanding of food and his artistry must be admired by all that have the opportunity to experience it.\\n\\nThe waiter and all the staff were exceptionally friendly and I have never experienced better service at any restaurant I have ever been to in the world.\\n\\nThank you of such an amazing experience and I hope to be back soon.\"",

            "If you appreciate culinary art and the variety of flavours you should absolutely try to get a booking at Alo. It's not just dinner, it's an experience that I can only compare to visiting a gallery or opera. The service is incredibly attentive but in no way destructive, the drinks are perfection (especially if you love watching bartenders do their magic like I do) and food is just so well balanced and thought through. As someone who doesn't do fine dining often I can honestly say this is worth every penny and I hope it always gets the appreciation it deserves. \"",
            "I thought I was lucky to get reservations to this restaurant.  I had high expectations as the reservations were nearly sold out within 30 minutes of their release.  I opted for the Chef's Counter Experience (Extended Tasting Menu - Kitchen Counter) for 2 people ($330 CAD).  \\n\\nThe restaurant is hidden on Spadina.  Keep a look out for the number 163 above the door.  \\n\\nUpon entering, I was greeted at the entrance and directed towards the elevator which took me to the restaurant.  They checked my coat and brought me to our seats, right in front of the kitchen staff.  Our seats were like tall bar chairs with a view of the entire kitchen.  Immediately I was offered a clip for my purse to hang on the table and they took our drink orders.  \\n\\nNow this is where things took a turn.  For a $600 bill, I was completely unimpressed with our meal.  The oysters, duck, and whatever else was served left me unsatisfied.  I have eaten at Alinea and Alo cannot compare.  It may not be fair to compare but Alo lacked a memorable flavor and experience.  On a positive note, their drinks are delicious.  I do not feel this was worth the price I paid.  \"",
            "Our group of five dined at ALO earlier this week for a celebration of two birthdays. Since my last visit about a year ago, I'm thrilled to write that the best restaurant in Canada is still top of the game! The 12-course tasting menu, including the complimentary ones, was customized based on our dietary restrictions and was delicious from the amuse-bouche to the petit-fours. Three years after its inception and two offshoots later, ALO still lives up to its reputation as the creme de la creme among all restaurants in Canada. My favourite that night was the Hokkaido Sea Scallop with Perigord Black Truffle and the Pineapple, Dark Chocolate with Coconut and Mint dessert. The service was impeccable and it's still the only Toronto restaurant where I feel like I was dining at a Michelin-star restaurant in Europe. The food melted in our mouths and the cabernet sauvignon from Napa was the perfect pairing. Even though I like Aloette and Alo Bar Yorkville, I do miss the original ALO. It still took us over a month to reserve but it's definitely a memorable experience to look forward to. Bravo to chef owner Patrick Kriss and his team for delivering excellence and consistency in food quality and hospitality that are second to none!\"",
            "I recently had a chance to have dinner at Alo. After trying to get a reservation for almost a year, I finally got a call about a cancellation and was seated at a table 4 hours later. Dinner was incredible...such an experience. Staff were friendly, knowledgeable and always helpful but never intrusive. We had the pairing menu, and the sommelier\\u002Fwine were also a wonderful experience. I had never tried many of the wines we tasted. \\n\\nThis was a special occasion for us, and it was by good measure the most I have spent ever on dinner for 4, but quite honestly, we all had a fantastic time, and I thought it was worth it.\"",
            "Most people I know would dine at ALO for a special occasion, but I'd like to go at least twice a year with or without an occasion to commemorate or celebrate because I love the food and service and I'm proud that Canada finally has a restaurant that matches the world's best. My most recent experience was, as usual, heavenly as the 11-course tasting menu was flawless and the service was impeccable. The 70 percent focus on seafood - Bigeye Tuna, Hokkaido Sea Scallop, Kanpachi, Sea Urchin, and East Coast Lobster - was very much to my liking. I've always said that ALO's meat dishes are probably weaker than its seafood offerings, but even the meat courses - Muscovy Duck and Milk-Fed Veal Tenderloin -  during our last visit were superb. Kudos to Chef Owner Patrick Kriss who has recently promoted a team of millennial staff both behind the kitchen and in front-line hospitality and service. The price of the tasting menu has been increased again to $145 before drinks, taxes and gratuities and a non-refundable deposit of $50 per person is required to reserve a table. But it's still very reasonable when compared to other restaurants of the same calibre around the world. If you were a connoisseur of French food, you could not possibly skip ALO just like you could not live in San Francisco and have yet to visit Thomas Keller's The French Laundry in Yountville!\"",
            "This restaurant truly lives up to its reputation as a top-notch establishment, providing a remarkable combination of impeccable service, exquisite cuisine, and a delightful ambiance. From the moment I stepped into the restaurant, I was greeted with warmth and professionalism by the attentive staff. The level of service was exceptional, with the waitstaff displaying extensive knowledge about the menu and a genuine passion for their craft. \\n\\nThe menu featured an impressive selection of dishes that showcased the culinary expertise of the chef. Each plate was a work of art, beautifully presented with attention to detail. The flavors were a symphony of tastes, combining exquisite ingredients and innovative combinations that delighted the palate.\"",
            "Birthday dinner at ALO. \\n\\nThis truly is an experience in gastronomic delight. \\nIt\\u2019s culinary theatre. \\nI can\\u2019t begin to describe this dining experience. Everything is exquisite but not pretentious. From the moment you enter the building, you are greeted by name and excorted to the private elevator. At the 3rd floor you are again greeted, this time by owner\\u002Fchef Patrick Kriss. \\n\\nThe meal is a 10 course blind tasting menu. Each course is a mouthful of deliciousness. From PEI oysters... to foie gras... sea urchin... to seared scallop...dover sole... lamb saddle... finishing with fig ice cream, miniature s\\u2019mores, macaroons, sorrel cotton candy and a special miniature birthday cake for me. \\nThe champagne cart satisfied my love of bubbles during our meal. \\n\\nAt the end of our meal we were presented with an envelope that had our menu and wine pairings. Also a \\u201Chappy birthday \\u201C was on my menu.\"",

            "Having eaten at other Aloette Bar, Aloette, and take-out during the pandemic, finally I managed to reserve at the Alo Dining Room. We had the eleven course tasting menu with the nine course wine pairings (2 oz. each). Starting with a warm welcome, we proceeded to a quiet dining room, that was never crowded nor hurried, creating a leisurely atmosphere. The servers are outstanding, well trained and a well honed team. They are attentive but never obtrusive. The food is beautifully presented and delicious. My date and I have lived in many countries and visited many more. We rated this meal among the best we have eaten. It is expensive but the expense is justified.\"",
            "We were very excited to attend Alo Restaurant. With all the hype surrounding the place and its penchant for \\\"contemporary French\\\" cuisine, I expected savoury sauces that would surely impress.\\n\\nInstead we arrived and were thoroughly disappointed. The restaurant does not serve French cuisine. In fact, our server described the chef as heavily inspired by Asian cuisine and techniques. Each plate off the blind, multi-course tasting menu varied in texture but was consistently covered in a bitter\\u002Fsalty sauce. And when I say varied in consistency, I mean from slimy to chewy and, without fail, always covered in the same disgusting sauce.\\n\\nKudos to the serving staff! I have to say, the servers were incredibly attentive. This is the one thing working for Alo. The servers ensure you never want for anything and do not impose - your glass is always topped, plates promptly removed, etc.\\n\\nNevertheless, this is the type of place that would say the food was hand-chopped or ingredients personally curated. It's that pretentious. And yes, it attracts like-minded socialites or the 1000 dollar millionaire types. Seated next to me was a plastic surgeons wet dream. This wannabe Instagram influencer lacked any semblance of class and had her boyfriend dawn a camera with flash over and over and over again in what was otherwise a dimly lit restaurant. Who blinds other patrons for the perfect shot and what kind of five-star restaurant allows that sort of behaviour? \\n\\nRestaurant was an utter disappointment. While I appreciated the level of attentiveness, you can't tout service at the expense of the food. And at a cost upwards of $300 per person, be more discriminating with the patrons you allow into your establishment!\"",
            "What a unique and wonderful dining experience!!  Service was stellar from the moment we entered.\\n\\nI communicated with this restaurant several months in advance and made sure they could accommodate my wife\\u2019s dietary restrictions for her birthday celebration.\\n\\nThey explained they could not modify the menu in their main dining room, but would if we sat in the bar area. Considering the high quality of being a Michelin restaurant, I readily accepted. We both loved our experience.\\n\\nThey saved a special corner table (# 26) for us, overlooking the rest of the bar area.\\n\\nFood was a 5-course menu for $120 ea. Drinks were an additional $189, for a total of $429 CAD.\\n\\nJoy, our server took great care of us. Food was exquisite.  We would love to return.\\n\"",
            "I was fortunate to be taken to Alo for a milestone birthday.  I have been in a few European Michelin starred establishments and Alo   was absolutely not a poor Canadian substitute.  The food itself was enjoyable. I had my doubts if I would be able to eat 10 courses but I tried everything, leaving little room for the 2 dessert courses which were superb.  The wagyu beef that my companion ordered and  ( shared a small slice with me ) spoiled us from maybe ever enjoying \\\"ordinary beef\\\" again. \\nBut it is the presentation and service  that is impeccable. No course was served on a type of plate that had been seen before.  Staff are there to wipe up every drop of water before you even notice it. I gave most of my fois gras first course to my companion ( not a huge fan) and about three courses later I was presented with a dish customized to my lack of enjoyment with the fois gras since that dish was to have included it as well.  They had \\\"noticed\\\" that I had not enjoyed it fully. Wow! \\nSpecial celebrations are honoured with a small chocolate gateaux.\\nThe only negative remark would involve  2 of the people at the table beside  us who got into a very loud argument with the woman sprinkling many f-bombs. Staff and other guests clearly heard this and staff did nothing to defuse the situation.  \\nThe presentation of the menu in the sealed envelope at the end of the meal was a classy touch and a keepsake for my \\\"special day\\\" \\nThe restaurant has two sittings, one seemed to be around 530 and the second at 830 ( reservations staggered every 5 minutes it seemed to avoid everyone arriving at the same time.)\\nWould absolutely recommend Alo to anyone wanting a different culinary experience.\"",
            "This is a truly outstanding restaurant in many ways but it is small and it seems impossible to get a reservation now.  Try their other spot downstairs - Aloette, a more casual venue but very stylishly designed and the food is still stunning.\"",
            "I had always wanted to try Alo since I've heard great things about it and I also really enjoyed Aloette so I decided to try my luck at reserving a table for my birthday.  So on the the first Tuesday at 10 am (October to book for Nov and Dec seats), I completely lucked out and was able to get a table for 2 at the Kitchen Counter for 7pm.  The restaurant is tucked away on Spadina and when you enter at the ground level, you will be greeted immediately and wished happy birthday after the greeter checked her computer.  The elevator ride does not match with what we were about to experience because once the doors opened, we were transported into a different world.  We were greeted again and asked if we wanted to have a drink before we were seated.  We passed on that and waited in the front area for a short while before we were seated at the kitchen counter.  The view was great - we could see the entire kitchen!  Our server was super attentive and friendly.  We are not huge wine drinkers so we didn't go with the pairing menu but did a 2 white & 1 red glass combo which was recommended by our sommelier.  We asked her to help us pick out the wines and she seemed reluctant to do so until she asked us some questions about what kinda of wines do we like\\u002Fusually drink. I'm not going to into every single dishes' details but every single dish was prepared with care, thought and detail.  Some dishes were: oysters, scallops, beef, venison, tuna, egg dish and 4 desserts including a small chocolate cake!  Desserts were very light but we couldn't finish a couple so we asked them to pack it away so we can have them later!! The tastes we experienced was absolutely delightful.  Everything worked as a whole and the serving pace was good (~ 2.5 end to end).  I actually started to getting full around course 7-8!  A couple of stand out\\u002Fexceptional experiences during the dinner:  1)  cutlery placement depending on whether you were left or right handed 2) my husband needed to take a call so he left the table as we were being served a dish but instead of putting both plates down, they pulled both plates back (to keep warm) so that we can both eat at the same time when he was finished his call  3) since this was a set 13 course tasting menu, they couldn't accommodate for any allergies or dietary restrictions so going into the dinner I knew there was a chance that I would be served something that I wasn't fan of -- foie gras.  I did try a bit but decided to give the rest to my husband. The staff caught that right away and came over immediately to ask if everything was ok and whether I wanted an additional dish.  I said it's all fine, I just am not a fan of foie gras.  However, they still went ahead and prepped a sablefish for BOTH of us!! AND it was Chef Kriss who did the final check on our fish before it was served!! I can't believe they actually saw my husband take my foie gras and to go above and beyond to prep another dish for us! We were so happy with the overall experience.  We have had tasting menus in other \\\"top notch\\\" Toronto restaurants which completely fell short so we were really hoping Alo wasn't going to disappoint and they certainly did not!! It is pricey however we highly recommend if you want to experience top notch service, food and atmosphere.  We were then greeted again and given our desserts when we were ready to leave.  We definitely will be returning!!\"",
            "Yes... you have to book your table in advance, online.\\nYes... arrive on time. They hold the table for 15 mins, if late. Don\\u2019t be late.\\nYes... this is a tasting menu, quality not quantity. Highly suggest the wine pairing menu that follows your dishes.\\nYes... they ask you 3 times if you have any allergies and dietary restrictions.\\nShow up and enjoy, the staff are attentive and look to provide you an amazing experience.\"",
            "My wife and I have had the pleasure of dining in some wonderful restaurants, including Joel Robuchon's Restaurant Jamin in 1992-- and still the best dining experience ever for us.  For Alo, I got on the waiting list as I wanted to take my wife here as a surprise for our 55th anniversary.  We were fortunate to get in, which is not easy, and thoroughly enjoyed the 10-course blind menu (there is no printed menu).  There is also a way to do a 6-course version in the bar area.  It can be tricky to figure out details on the website, so suggest call.  I'm not a fan of the word \\\"foodie,\\\" but it you have an appreciation for extremely tasty and beautiful courses, you will love this place. Vegan or vegetarian- suggest don't go here. All the staff work together as a team; you are not assigned a server. They have this part figured out as well.  The place is not stuffy, no dress code, some wore pretty casual clothes, or you can dress up.   They do send you away with a souvenir menu as you depart !\"",
            "This is a wonderful restaurant with excellent staff, almost as many as the patrons they are serving. The open kitchen is interesting to watch and the conversation is easy. Everything from amuse bouche to dessert was either very good or excellent. Especially the duck and wagyu beef. Reviewing the individual dishes won't work because the menu changes every day.\\n\\nThe staff pay attention to issues about allergies or dislikes.\\n\\nThe only negative is the cost. One of the most if not the most expensive meal we've had at $480 per couple. Be prepared to break the bank.\"",
            "I had a great experience dining with friends at ALO. We were a group of 5 with various dietary restrictions and preferences. ALO was able to accommodate us all and the several course tasting menu was great!

            "I recently came to Alo to celebrate an occasion and was initially impressed with the professionalism of the staff and that they all acknowledged the occasion we were celebrating. \\n\\nHowever, our table was vegetarian and have a serious food allergy, which I confirmed would not be an issue with the restaurant on three separate occasions.\\n\\nTwice at the restaurant we were served dishes that conflicted with our dietary restrictions. The waiter offered a complimentary cheese dish as an apology for these mishaps. \\n\\nUnfortunately, we were served something that caused an allergic reaction mid way through dinner and continued for the following two days.\\n\\nI would have preferred to have been told that our dietary restrictions could not be accommodated. We expected better service at Alo given the reputation of the restaurant and the cost of the meal.\\n\\nAlthough the food, when prepared properly, was delicious, I am unimpressed that a restaurant such as Alo would make so many errors on something as important as dietary restrictions.\""

            "Read about it as one of the top-100 restaurants in Toronto and more than lived up to the hype.  The place had a nice cool but casual vibe.  Service was very efficient, water and wine were constantly kept full and service was always present but not obtrusive.  \\n\\nThe food was the highlight.  We were a group of 4 and share four dishes from the starter side of the menu, three mains, a rice and a couple of veg.  For the starters, the highlight for me (for the meal actually) were the lamb ribs.  Also really enjoyed the hummus with wagyu.  My only disappointment was the ahi, it did not have as much flavor as I expected (and tuna is one of my favorite meats).  I also expected it to be slices rather than a tartare diced style.  Not bad but not as great as the ribs or hummus.\\n\\nFor mains, we went with the signature dish, lamb shoulder, which was excellent and a very good sized portion.  I also enjoyed the middle eastern fried chicken, lots of flavor.  I found the salmon good but not incredible.  I love Brussels sprouts and theirs were excellent.  Also enjoyed the cauliflower.\\n\\nI skipped dessert but my colleagues loved the sorbet and pistachio ice cream.  Overall, a great meal.\"",
            "We went for the vegetarian menu options, but the ambiance sealed the deal. I read other reviews and am surprised by the less enthusiastic comments... the possible disconnect is that the upstairs vibe is more bar lounge and is way nicer than the downstairs, which seemed more cafe style.\\n\\nByblos' location is excellent, right in the downtown core, and the food was surprisingly flavourful. As it's mostly tapas style dining, small shared plates which was perfect with early evening cocktails. The zucchini flowers stuffed with eggplant were amazing (Byblos if you want to send me the recipe, I'd gratefully accept!) as were all the other dishes we sampled.\\n\\n I'd definitely go back - 9\\u002F10.\"",

They bring 1 lb. of lamb cooked sous vide with great spices.  The server rips it up with forks and then you eat it with lavash bread (and they are able to bring more bread if you run out).   A full tray of nice additional sauces and spices is provided. \\n\\nThe hummus and wagyu appetizer was also great- really interesting bread (not pita) that came with it- so delicious.

Matt informed us that since we had already paid there was nothing he could do. We asked for a refund equivalent to the two drinks. He then did it. We told him to send our dessert, and reluctantly he did, but since we were over our 2 hour mark at this point our server asked us to leave before the dessert arrived.

            "We were visiting Toronto and wanted to have a nice meal out one night so looked up some downtown restaurants in advance. I'm so glad we booked this place! The food was amazing - really good flavours and hard to narrow down which dishes to order since the menu has so many choices. We had the Turkish Manti Dumplings, Beef Tartare, Short Rib Kebab, Sweet Jeweled Rice and finished with the Labneh Cheesecake. I had the tempranillo wine which paired nicely with our food. Our server Josh was very personable and attentive. Will definitely go back if I'm in Toronto again. \"",
            "Good food, good service, good location, but extremely noisy. I dont give it a five because of the noise and because the hosts refuse to let the customers use the toilet located at street level, and not that it was out of service. It is a very unusual comment, but it happened twice within our group  and it caught our attention. Expensive!\"",
            "Spectacular service with food that stimulates every taste bud! Wow. This hidden little gem is located in downtown Toronto in a darkly lit building with a nice cozy atmosphere. From the initial greeting to the end of dinner the service by Jamal was outstanding. He took care of us in every way but mostly he made us laugh and enjoy our beautiful meal throughout each course. The food was delightfully surprising. We ordered the fried eggplant for starters which was my favorite dish of the evening. We also had the truffle and cheese pide and the crispy olives which were also very tasty. The radicchio salad was really delicious as was the tuna tartare with watermelon. The star of the evening was the braised lamb shoulder with small rollups and lots of shug, pickles and onions. We stuffed ourselves on dinner so much we couldnt possibly order dessert although one of us took home the lemon olive oil cake with lemon curd and reported back that it was very nice. The meal was about CA $450 but that included a couple of cocktails. The tastes were incredibly unusual and each food had a taste of its own. We would definitely go back. If you go, ask for Jamal!\"",
            "Love Byblos.  The food is stellar.  Service always great. Great cocktail list.  Dining tables can be small.\"",
            "We dined at Byblos before the theatre. The menu had many options, and the server suggested that we choose 3 to 5 menu items. The items we selected were unusual and of outstanding quality. The service was prompt and attentive.\"",
            "Wonderful restaurant across the board. Took several people from work and it was just incredible. While we tried virtually everything on the menu, there were some real standouts. Among the starters, , the hummus Royale with Wagyu, menti dumplings and fried eggplant were the standouts. The two salads were both good but the pear salad can\\u2019t be missed, really unique flavors. Among the mains, the lamb shoulder and whole branzino were the stars. Dessert were also good, except a somewhat pedestrian baklava. Also nice wine options at reasonable prices.\"",
            "DESPICABLE SERVICE. BYBLOS DOWNTOWN DOES NOT VALUE CLEANLINESS OR CUSTOMER SERVICE.\\n\\nShort story: we found a LIVE caterpillar in our food. Tyler, the closing manager, threatened that if we didn't pay for the food that we DID NOT consume he would call the police. As racialized women, we felt we had no choice but to pay the bill.\\n\\nLong story: The evening started off great with wine and apps.   We had just started the second course when we noticed a caterpillar had crawled out of one of the dishes. We didn't know which dish so we immediately all stopped eating. We quickly caught the attention of a passing server and they removed the caterpillar and escalated the situation to the manager. Tyler was the only manager available to \\\"assist\\\" us.  Right off the bat he was unapologetic and tried to offer us a complimentary dessert. We communicated to him that we had lost our appetite and did not wish to continue dining; despite this, a third course was brought to the table. We communicated to Tyler AGAIN that we did not want to continue with our dinner. He removed the dishes and brought the bill. We assumed that Byblos, a well-established restaurant, would not charge us for the dishes we did not consume\\u002Fhad a bug in it.  Any other restaurant in Toronto would have removed those items from the bill, at the very least, or would have comped us for the entire meal. However, when the bill arrived, it included half of the second course, which we never consumed, and he stated that he had 'waived' the third course (which came after we communicated that we didn't want to dine there) as an \\\"apology\\\" for our experience (it's not an apology when you remove items from the bill that shouldn't have been on the bill in the first  place). He stated that mistakes happen and this was the best he could do. He refused to remove those items and we escalated the matter further. He spoke to the manager (Matt) who was offsite. We waited patiently for 45 minutes (we could have easily walked out but we didn't). When Tyler returned he provided us with the exact same bill and said that we either had to pay the bill or that he would call the 52 division for non-payment. We were all shocked that he threatened to call the police, especially because we were more than happy to pay for what we consumed. What started as an unfortunate mistake turned into a despicable customer experience. A simple apology and waiving of unconsumed food, which was completely at the fault of Byblos, would have de-escalated the situation. Instead, we were subject to unnecessary threats, including being followed and forced out of the restaurant. We will be making a formal complaint to Dinesafe Toronto and will never be dining at Byblos again.\"",

Our server was exceptional!\\n\\nWe began with a cold gin mint tea to share, served in a beautiful tea set with dry ice wafting from the top. Then came the yogurt beet dish everyone raves about - rich and layered in flavor, served with moist but crispy pistachio drenched crumbs on top.\\n\\nThe next dish did not add to our experience, but also did not distract: ox-tail (which I love in the soup I make) packed in little pancake envelopes with a mild jalape\\u00F1o puddle underneath. They were OK.\\n\\nAfter came one of the most beautiful salads with fresh figs, nuts and flower peddles... light and the perfect amount of dressing.\\n\\nThen the mains: 24 hour tender braised lamb with multiple condiments (all house made, of course), to wrap in fresh pita, and a healthy stack of fluffy rice topped with crisp shaved carrots (how do they do that?), nuts and pomegranates. Delicious!!\\n\\nWhile all this was going on we continued with cocktails: try the geographer, or, the spiced g & t. Layered and delish!\\n\\nTo end we had espresso, velvety and fruity, and a pistachio cake with - get this - a Persian version of cotton candy on top, and a layer of pistachios on the bottom. In the middle a pistachio mousse that was not cloying and sweet... sheer perfection.\\n\\nWould we go again? How about tonight?\"",

            "We ate dinner here with a large group and we had a pre-ordered feast of probably 12-15 dishes, each new to me, and each one was distinctive and wonderful. You're probably well-advised to let the waitress tell you what the favorites are; I couldn't tell from their names what they were. I ran out of stomach room near the end, but everything was excellent, including the wine and the staff. It's loud but not overwhelming. he place was humming on a Thursday evening, so be sure to make a reservation. It's a two-minute walk from the Ritz Carlton, around the corner form the convention center, and a couple of blocks from the Rogers Center.

            "Horrible experience \\n\\nDined here with four friends last Friday. Most of us have been to Byblos before and loved the food. We started out with a bottle of wine, cocktails and appetizers. Everything was great, as was our waiter Cody. We had just started on the second round of dishes when I noticed a caterpillar crawling out on the table. We alerted a waiter who apologized and got rid of it and sent over the bar manager Tyler. Tyler offered us a complimentary dessert. We had lost our appetites at that point and declined. Tyler offered to remake the dishes but we also said no and just asked that no other courses be sent out. About five minutes later, the two pides were served. Again we asked that they be removed and Tyler brought the bill which had several of the half eaten courses and food we didn\\u2019t even touch. Tyler stated he would remove the appetizers. We were pretty taken aback at this point seeing as the appetizers were the only thing we had actually finished at that point. By this time Tyler had been back and forth to our table several times and his demeanour was very rude. Several times we were asking questions and he\\u2019d speak while walking away from us. We suggested we pay for the apps, wine and cocktails. He said he\\u2019ll call his manager to see what he could do about the bill. We waited approximately 40 mins for him to return and tell us that the bill had not changed and if we still didn\\u2019t want to pay, he would call the police. I\\u2019m not sure why he felt the situation needed to be escalated to that point. We waited patiently, didn\\u2019t disturb other diners, and definitely had no intention of not paying for what we ate. It was the most insulting service I have ever had. Instead of creating a scene with police in the restaurant, we took a card and got the managers name, Matt, and paid hundreds of dollars for food we didn\\u2019t eat. On the way out, we stopped to talk to another waiter, Jordan, who honestly saved our night. He was gracious and apologetic and took the time to actually speak to us respectfully. The issue isn\\u2019t even the bug in the food, it was the attitude of the bar manager, Tyler. It\\u2019s unfortunate that one person could ruin a great night at a restaurant but the management was appalling and I would never return or recommend it.\"",
            "I hosted a dinner for 23, which can be a challenge.  But, Byblos rose to the occasion.  Served family style, there were a myriad of options, with one better than the next!  Great service, food, and wine!  GO THERE!\"",
            "I heard many good things about this restaurant and whenever I tried to make a reservation, it was always booked. I finally managed to reserve a spot.

            "What used to be my favourite restaurant in Toronto quickly turned into one of the most unhygienic and discourteous establishments over one evening for my birthday, party of 7. I've supported this restaurant for a while previously and often brought friends from abroad here, speaking very highly of their food, drinks and service.\\n\\nBy the end of our entrees, I found a live Silverfish bug in my drink. We can clearly see the flat and reflective body. Silverfish live in damp areas like the kitchen and bathroom. We called our server who then called her manager to come over to assess and see what they could do. I recall seeing the manager trying to hold herself back from laughing as if the problem wasn't serious. Her resolution was to offer us free prosecco but we declined after having already consumed two bottles of expensive wine and additional cocktails at our table. Manager asked us what she should do, however it's an extremely uncomfortable thing to ask guests to figure out what a manager to do, since it is...their job to resolve these problems. Not to mention, I have a phobia of bugs. I didn't feel that we were in a position to identify the solution-- we considered that being part of management's role. Since we couldn't provide an answer, the manager said they would think of what to do and returned to our table with a plate of chocolate sauce and the Pavlova dessert (value of $14) as an apology. Normally, dining establishments throw in a sweet dish for guests celebrating their birthdays anyways, including chains like Jack Astors, therefore the problem during our dining experience felt like no big deal for the restaurant. The resolution felt like a low effort answer to our problem in attempt to sweep the issue under the rug. The round of prosecco would have costed more than the Pavlova. The server was also using the same jug for everyone else in the dining area upstairs where the live Silverfish came from and we can assume that their staff likely don't thoroughly check or wash their jugs or glasses before serving their guests. The server who poured our drinks didn't even check\\u002Fnotice which I felt was a miss on their part. Who knows where these pests are manifesting and living within the restaurant and what kind of tardy hygiene practice the staff are performing.\\n\\nWe still ended up paying in full + gratuity and additional tip on top for the kitchen, drinks and food. I personally felt like the management beyond POOR and they were either inexperienced with customer service, poor lack of judgement and handled the issue at our table extremely below the standards.\\n\\nDespite leaving with the very bad taste in my mouth, this evening's low review doesn't reflect the food but the management in how they chose to deal with our situation and the unhygienic environment for these live critters to be crawling into our drinks\"",

Since each course consisted of two different dishes, we were able to sample 14 different dishes.  Each course was exquisitely presented and unique--we loved them all.

However, the approach also created conflict, dilemma and disappointment for us, in that, in a few instances, one of us was served dishes with ingredients that the other person fancied and vice-versa.\\nTherefore, for tonight\\u2019s dinner. to play safe and to avoid disappointment and jealousy, we have requested ahead of time that IDENTICAL dishes of the same course be served to both my partner and myself. This approach also allows us to compare notes of the same dish.\\n\\nTonight\\u2019s menu approach: We decided to place our gastronomic journey and fate at the hand of Chef Loseto. His multi-faceted, fusion Omakase menu ended up with a superb and imaginative 9 course feast. The dishes include:\\n\\nAmuse bouche: Stuffed Zucchini Flower Tempura\\nAppetizers: Tuna Tataki Wrap\\nWhite Asparagus with crudo marinated Hamachi\\nSeafood courses: De-constructed Dungeness Crab Cake\\nChar-grilled Octopus\\nMeat course: Wagyu Beef wrapped grilled Romaine Lettuce\\nSeared Foie Gras with Roasted Squab\\nMain course: Seared and roasted Venison Rack\\nCheese course: Ashley Goat Cheese and Mountain oak cow\\u2019s milk Cheese\\nDessert course: Alberobello chocolate and salted caramel Gelato\\nCherry, Mascarpone, Mango Mousse Cake\\n\\nWow! What a surprise and what a meal! The first impression of many dishes were eye-appealingly pretty and busy in a psychedelic way\\u2026..an edible Joan Miro Painting?! However to our amazement and surprise, the combined ingredients and products somehow yielded a harmonious mouth feel and taste profile!....a reflection of the chef\\u2019s skill and understanding of the various components and elements used!\\n\\nOf all the dishes presented, the perfectly cooked, \\u2018oh-so-delicious\\u2019 Venison dish rose head and shoulder above the rest and really made my evening! Coming in a close second was the Foie Gras and Squab dish. Again, the main components of this dish were perfectly executed. So many honorable dishes worth mentioning, they included the White Asparagus and Hamachi, the smoky Chargrilled Octopus, the deconstructed Crab Cake, the Mascarpone Mango mousse cake\\u2026..etc. IMHO, a more lenient Michelin inspector would have given George a star?!\\n\\nLastly, a special thank you to our friendly, warm, attentive and professional server - \\u2018Ryan\\u2019, who kept us entertained in between dishes, due to a packed house tonight!\"",
            "Went to George with friends for an evening out...we selected the 5-course tasting menu with wine pairing...it was excellent.  They mixed up the tastes nicely, and the wine parings they chose for us perfectly complemented the food.  I have been to similar types of restaurants but this one is the best I have found to date.  As a bonus, it has great atmosphere!\"",
            "My wife Shelly dined at George one time 2 years before we got married. She raved about the food and the experience. She looked out the window and saw the courtyard, it just caught her eye. When we started to look at venues, George was the first that came to mind. When we sent an email inquiry, Chris got back to us and provided lots of details. When we met her in person, she was very friendly and helpful, giving us a run-down of what a wedding at George would look like, and showed us the beautiful space. We knew it would be a wonderful setting for our wedding. Chris is amazing and helped us tremendously throughout the entire process; from locking in the date, to keeping in touch in the months in-between, to filling out our event orders closer to our big day. I remember enjoying every time I walked through those doors to the restaurant or the Verity club, either to meet with Chris or to have our menu tasting. Chris the sommelier is awesome, he really took care of us during the menu tasting and our wedding night. I want to sincerely say thanks to Chris, Chris, and the rest of the staff.\\nNow let's talk about the food. One of the first things Chris told us was chef Lorenzo is incredible, and we agree profoundly. Our menu had items like lobster with brulee avocado, Wagyu beef, rack of lamb, halibut with sake miso and cauliflower. They were all so mouthwatering good! We had an intimate wedding with our closest friends and family, and the consensus was they were very happy that night. I bet the food was a huge contributor.\\nA few months have passed since that night at George, but I still remember it fondly. We recently got our wedding photos and flipping through them let us re-live the day. It rained, so we didn't have the ceremony in the courtyard. But the Grand Georgian room was just as beautiful, plus it kept our loved ones warm and dry. Looking at the photos of the restaurant, the food, the drinks, and the joy; it was perfect.\"",
            "What a great place to go for Christmas lunch with the office crew and spouses! Reservations handled professionally and efficiently- lovely table with friendly service. Cocktails and a vast wine selection. Did the 3 course chef surprise- mushroom soup bouch\\u00E9e followed by salmon tartare and bison fillet minion. All beautifully presented and delicious. Nice selection of desert as well. Memorable Christmas lunch!\"",
            "We dined here due to TripAdvisor reviews, and the experience and food did not disappoint. My husband and I have done tasting menus with wine pairings in a variety of restaurants but this was our daughter\\u2019s first experience. We chose the 7 course. All courses were well presented at a good pace for enjoying every morsel as well as the variety of wine. Many restaurants of this style have a stuffier air about them, and we loved that the atmosphere was more friendly and therefore more relaxing. It was fun to look over and see the many preparations and bustling about going on in the open kitchen. \\nThe unusual part about this restaurant is that the tasting menu is all blind. We had absolutely no idea what we would be getting, and each of us received a different offering than the other at each course - none of it was off of the regular menu, so that is a great challenge for the chef! Our wines were also completely different so we could sample each other\\u2019s. All tasting menus we have experienced at other restaurants always have it printed on the menu. We thoroughly enjoyed what we received and the wide variety. Our server Lorenzo and the wine sommelier Andrew were exceptional; we enjoyed our dinner and highly recommend George\\u2019s.\"",
            "Went with a couple of friends and was left very satisfied and happy.\\nEven though it is a high end restaurant the atmosphere is very relaxed and the staff is friendly, while still very professional.\\nWe had a drink by the bar without them rushing us or pushing us to get seated. The mixologist knew what he was doing, My Old Fashioned was perfect.\\nAfter drinks we were taken to our table and the Maitre d' joined us to explain to us the different options of their tasting menu. \\nWe chose the Ten-Course tasting with the Wine Pairing. EXCELLENT choice! The food was delicious and it is worth noting that each one of us got different dishes. That leaves the option open to visit again and try different dishes. As for the wine, even though we had some French and Italian wines they also surprised us with Israeli and Hungarian wines, which were very good and a perfect match to their dishes.\\nGeorge has been open for 20 years and yet they keep being relevant by constantly renovating and reinventing themselves. I'll definitely be on the look for the next project of Chef Lorenzo Loseto.\"",

Our server, Rob, went above and beyond to ensure my mother and I were taken care of.  Professional and friendly with the exact time management to ensure we felt left alone to enjoy yet at our service if need be. The food!!! I can't even tell you! Explosion in your mouth of flavours and textures.  Kudos to chef who's food was truly artwork!  I have eaten almost everywhere in Toronto, and this is by far 5 star dining at it's best.  Excellent choice for dinner or even an event! Go! You won't be disappointed!\"",
            "If you like progressive eating, beautiful presentations, and unique wine pairings, this is a must go for you. Expect to pay a king's ransom for a couple but it is worth the treat. Excellent service tops it all off. \"",
            "George is a different experience.  We were a group of 4 couples and we were seated at a large round table in the restaurant which was ideal for conversation.  The decor is done up to look like a patio garden (I'm guessing) and while it was cute it lacked any real charm.  The server let us know that if we wanted the tasting menu, the entire table had to agree, there was to be no mix of menu diners seated with tasting menu diners so we all agreed on the seven course tasting option.  The waiters asked to know who had dietary restrictions which was very appreciated as a few of us had some real allergies.  As to be expected the plates were small and yet they were so delicious.  A couple of us felt they were too small but for me I thoroughly enjoyed them.  Towards the end of the meal I noticed one of my plates had product I was allergic to so I notified the staff.  They replaced the item with one that did not have the allergens and reduced the bill for the error which was also nice.\\n\\nMy overall impression was that the food was the star of the experience.  I did not give a 5 star review as the wait staff could have been more attentive and the decor was uninspiring.  I truly enjoyed the food and, had the staff been more attentive I would return, as a top rated restaurant I did expect more.\\n\\nI do recommend going if you are a foodie or just want the experience.\"",
            "Enjoyed  family dinner here in a private dining room. Serves superb seafood and fish. Highly recommended.\"",
            "We were here for an anniversary dinner after Stage 3 re-opening. All staff and guests had to wear masks in all public areas. Extremely filling vegetarian 5 course to the point where when we weren't able to finish a dish, we had to actually ensure that it was because of our limited appetite and nothing to do with the dish. From this, to their courteous service to wishing us for our anniversary (mentioned during reservation), the attention to detail was evident throught our dining. We absolutely loved it and look forward to celebrating another special ocassion there.\"",
            "Firstly - this is a definite special occasion place. Eating here should be thought of as an experience that could take several hours if you get a large number of courses. There are three tasting menus (5,7 and 10 courses). Each person gets a different dish from their fellow diner (assuming two people dining). This adds to the experience and fun of the evening. The food is a work of art and once the tasting menu is completed, you will be comfortably full. Service is a little slow paced - we have been on two occasions and ordered the 7 course menu. Each time it has taken about 3 hours to complete the meal, but we have never been in a rush, so it has not mattered. The chefs bring out each dish and explain how they are constructed to each diner. There is also an a-la-carte menu, but to be honest - you are not getting the full \\\"experience\\\" if you go with this option. Overall, if you are looking for a really nice memorable dinner, then this place will not disappoint. Yes, it is expensive, but it's also really really good. If you are a fussy eater, do not bother, but if you like good food and are willing to just run with trusting the chefs to create something amazing, then you are in for a great time.\"",
            "So after years of living in this amazing city, I finally decided to try this place out. Classy, gorgeous, great service. The dessert was amazing! However if you are looking for a special meal like I was...Vegetarian, no fish\\u002Fseafood...I found it to be a bit underwhelming. I would recommend the place for a gorgeous ambiance and great service...and dessert, but probably not for the \\u201Cspecial\\u201D food itself. I feel I have had better...scratch that, I know I have had better. Plating though was very tastefully done- see posted pics, they are works of art...my takeaway on this was that the chef was not as comfortable with not \\u201Ccooking\\u201D his food as he should be (example his salads lacked creativity whilst they looked beautiful, they were boring to eat). The cooked dishes were definitely much better but not outstanding. Time to convert to being non-vegetarian or should I give this place another go??\"",
            "We were four for dinner and had high expectations after hearing about the restaurant and reading reviews.\\n\\nThe building is unremarkable and the signage is minimalist so be sure you know where you are going because you could easily walk right by it. It is also unclear at the main door whether you are to take the door on the left or the door on the right. Head to the left.\\n\\nOnce inside, the greeting and coat check was friendly and efficient. Proceeding to our table, we took in a large room with many tables and an open kitchen. The tables were not too close together but it was quite busy so occasionally, a large party at an adjacent table got boisterous and it was distracting every now and then. Still, the acoustics in the room must be quite good because you didn't really notice the other guests most of the time.\\n\\nThe service was outstanding right from the start with multiple servers constantly making sure all questions were answered and every detail was taken care of promptly. The pace of the service was perfect with plenty of time to savor the wine and talk about the variety of dishes that were served.\\n\\nWe opted for the 5-course tasting menu with wine pairings despite the expansive wine list. I wanted to put ourselves in the hands of the somelier and experience the dishes with his wine recommendations.\\n\\nThe food was exceptional with four of the five courses with the beautiful plating and presentation creating a visual feast before the actual feast began. The amuse bouche was so good I wanted to lick the plate! Among our dishes was a foie gras centered dish that was outstanding as well as lamb chops that were just delectable little bites of goodness. Perhaps the only dish that didn't ''wow'' us was dessert which was certainly good but just not up to the calibre of the preceding dishes.\\n\\nWe started the evening with various cocktails and one very generous glass of wine; all good. The wines offered with our meal were all out-of-the-ordinary but perfectly paired and it was a special treat to feel that we had the full attention of the sommelier each time a new wine was being presented. Lots of wonderful insights and he took his time with our table and made sure we were happy with his suggestions. In 9 of the 10 pairings, the wine presented was perfectly matched to the food; in only one case the wine interesting in itself but didn't quite work as well as every other pairing. \\n\\nWe finished up with a variety of after dinner drinks to cap off a very special meal at a great restaurant.\\n\\nThe highlights were the cuisine, the sommelier and the wines, and the overall ambiance of the restaurant: classy but comfortable, exceptionally attentive service throughout and an experience I hope to repeat some time soon.\\n\\nThe five-course tasting menu, while having what I'll call compact servings, was an appropriate amount for food for someone with a normal appetite. We all left feeling quite satisfied. \\n\\nIf you go, be prepared for a hefty bill. We had cocktails and drinks after the meal and the bill for everything for 4 people (before tip) hit $1,000. Not something I can afford to do regularly but even so, if you want to treat yourself to a gastronomic experience with great wines and outstanding service, I recommend George highly.\"",
            "Went to celebrate a belated bday. We went with the 5 course tasting menu. The food was very creative and tasted great. The service was top notch too. The patio is beautiful and very relaxed atmosphere. The only comment I have about the food is the over use of mint. Mint was in all the dishes, and as I am not a huge fan of mint so for me it ruined the experience a little. The food was still delicious, and I recommend George\"",
            "For amazing food and great value George should be on your list of restaurants to experience.  The restaurant is housed in a historical building \\u2013 an 1850\\u2019s restored Chocolate Factory.  The restaurant\\u2019s interior is elegant and intimate creating the perfect backdrop for dining.  The quality of the food and service is superb. The cuisine is creative and delicious and is served by professional and attentive staff.  There are different tasting experiences that you can choose.   Our party of 4 decided to have the 20thAnniversary Series which is being offered from January 2024 to April 2024  (Tuesday to Friday).  This tasting experience consists of a three-course dinner plus a pre cocktail and snacks for $99 per person.  Our cocktails at Secrette were innovative and the snacks were delicious.  For our three-course menu we started with the Tuna Tartare which was beautifully prepared and presented and creative in the choice of accompaniments.  Our next course was a Beef Ribeye which was perfectly prepared and delicious as were the accompaniments.  Our last dish was a delightful lemon tart which was creatively presented.  For our choice of wine, we decided to try a wine from Croatia (Lasina).  Thanks to the Sommelier for assisting us with our choice.  Besides the inspired and innovative dishes by Chef Lorenzo, there is another plus and that is the staff.  Ryan, our server helped to make our dining experience a memorable one; his friendly, attentive service and professional manner were appreciated.  From the food to the staff this is one restaurant that does not disappoint.  For those of you who have not tried George, this is one dining experience you do not want to miss.  We look forward to our next dining experience at George.\"",
            "The highlight of this restaurant is definitely the food.  The combinations are incredibly complex, tasty and beautifully presented.  I can understand why it is considered one of the best in the city. \\n\\nHowever, given the price - $500 for two - there are a couple of areas that were a bit disappointing ... the service was very good but not great - we felt forgotten a few times - and they cram a lot of people into a fairly small space - there are a few nice booths up against the back wall (highly recommended), but everyone else is crammed into duces.  Just not as relaxing as we had hoped for. \\n\\nBe prepared to spend at least $100 on a bottle of wine - very few options below that price point.\"",
            "Due to the close proximity of our birthdays, for the past two decades and more, my foodie brother-in-law and myself have been holding annual 'men-only' birthday bash to celebrate this event. With a theme that builds around fine dining centred on Chef's tasting menu ( with optional wine pairing ), we have driven near and far, throughout the province, in search of such culinary offerings created by noted chefs. From Langdon Hall in the west to Treadwell farm-to-table out in the east and almost everything in between ( from past defunct gastro-temples like Centro, Splendido, Perigee, Senses, Truffles to existing stalwarts and up-and-coming stars like Scaramouche, Auberge-du-Pommier, Alo, Actinolite, Frilu...etc ), we have had our fair share of gastronomic delights.\\n\\nFor this year's special mile-stone event, we have decided to pay 'George' a long overdue re-visits. Apart from the two ex-Splendidos and Toronto's current culinary treasure 'Alo', based on past experiences, in our opinion, only 'George', under the baton of previous Gold-Plate award winner Chef Lorenzo Loseto, can deliver us with trusted and 'consistently' high level quality food, worthy of our repeat visits.\\n\\nOur venue decision did not disappoint! The artistic, spectacular and delectable dining experience met all our expectation and then some. I would rate it among the top 5 meals I have had in Canada. In my book, a solid Michelin star effort by the creative chef and his talented team.\\n\\nDuring and following this period of interruption caused by Covid, Chef Loseto did not miss a single beat. In fact, my observation tells me his skill and artistry have actually improved and mellowed, resulting in welcoming refinement and smoothing of the edges of his dishes. His current plating arrangements clearly displayed such metamorphosis. From the previous overly busy and 'macho' approach, his current composition is way more visually appealing and subtle. Fiery colourful, striking and visually pleasing arrangements dominated the plate.\\n\\nOn the palate side, Chef Loseto continued to amaze by utilizing his well-honed skill and knowledge in combining global flavor and taste profile into his French\\u002Ffusion dishes. The following are a few selected examples:\\n( North American ) - conventional pairing of perfectly seared jumbo diver scallops with a dense, traditional east-coast lobster bisque...to\\n( Middle Eastern ) - Infusing middle eastern spices into crispy French potato galette to create a Falafel like taste bomb or the use of Olive tepanade to enhance the savory component of grilled steak....to\\n( Japanese ) - Using a tasty sesame infused sweet Japanese Tamari to dress a fatty salmon belly wrap....to\\n( South American ) - Use of an exotic and flavorful house-made ChimiChurri sauce for a perfectly cooked medium rare lamb loin and chop....\\nAll these are masterful fusion touches designed to trigger wow-factors amongst his patrons.\\n\\nDuring the past ten days, I have had the good fortune of being able to dine in two of Toronto's top culinary Pantheons....'Alo' and 'George'. Whilst Alo creation resembled a calm and gentle Renoir or Monet masterpiece that featured some rich, deep, intense and complex, jet fighter like taste profile. George offering is like a vibrant, vivid and polychromatic Van Gogh artwork. The taste profile resembled more like a sleek business jet. Though more conservative, less bold and acute, overall, the use of diversify and intriguing exotic garnishes and ingredients still managed to create a delicious and enjoyable epicurean encounter.\\n\\nService for the evening was both professional, attentive and filled with good humour delivered by our friendly server ' Rob'. Strict Covid policy was adhered to.\\n\\nAfter this wondrous Michelin star calibre meal, my conclusion is that, in the current Toronto culinary landscape, George is way, way under-rated among its peers and IMHO, should deserve a much higher stature and ranking....at least in the top 10!\\n\\nCannot wait for my next visit to try out ' Game '!! :D\"",
            "A three-course dinner for two with two glasses of wine each was almost $500. The food ranged between very good and average. We also made a reservation for the courtyard and were surprised when we were led through a maze of hallways to the secondary patio, with a less desirable atmosphere. The service was also somewhat disorganized.\"",
            "It's been a long hard year for so many of us. When it became possible, once again, to go out and celebrate, the first choice for me and my husband was George Restaurant.

They are structured in such a way that you should really ordered all three courses for a full dinner experience.  That said any one of the courses on their own would be good enough if let's say you want something light. \\n\\nThey have excellent cocktails and a well-stocked cellar.    \\n\\nTable Service was particularly impressive from all staff that attended.  The only improvement could have been on the waitresses who debated a bit the orders of the dishes.   Probably a better approach would have been to bring the dishes as requested.

            "A good friend and I wanted a nice lunch. My Google search found George.   The entrance is a little hard to find off of Queen Street.  I actually went in the back entrance by mistake. The dining room is fairly large with jazz music playing that suits the atmosphere.   We were seated promptly with reservations that weren't necessary.  It was a not very busy Monday.  We ordered two of the Spanish wines that were featured.   Very good at $24 for a 9 oz glass.  Their wine selection is extensive ranging from $86 a bottle to several thousand. \\n\\nWe opted for the 4 course tasting menu at $80 each.  This consists of four courses, small portions -  morsels of pure satisfaction.   I had a salmon appetizer and my friend a lobster cervici.  Next, we each had a different pasta dish that melted in your mouth.   She had gnocchi that was heavenly and I had fresh angel hair pasta and a delicately seasoned sauce.  Following that, I had a tenderloin and my friend had venison.  Both tender and delicious but I was surprised a little that we were not given an option to say how we liked it cooked.   They were both very rare ... almost blue.  Too rare for my friend but my benefit.  We finished up with the most decadent desserts  I have ever had.   I had some sort of chocolate cake that made my mouth rejoice.   \\n\\nAn incredible lunch.   Although all portions were small, I was full by the end.  Service was excellent although I found it strange we were not asked through any of the courses if we were enjoying them.   Maybe they saw the smile on our faces.   My friend felt it odd that we both had different meals, but it does allow you to taste a little of everything. \\n\\nThis is a great place to come for an intimate or a business lunch.  You can easily have a conversation without having to compete with others or overwhelming music.    The meal came to $150 each (two glasses of wine) plus tip.   An incredible lunch and experience worth the price.\"",
            "George is a wonderful restaurant to experience fine dining in Toronto. We have been here twice, both times to celebrate a special birthday. We always choose the tasting menu(5 course) which is a blind tasting menu. They offer a 7 and 10 course as well but 5 courses is a lot of food in my opinion.  If coming with 4 people, 2 will get the same meal and 2 a different meal. We love tasting each others dishes. Every single dish is pretty spectacular. The service is always top notch and the cocktails ...don't get me started on the cocktails...so creative and delicious! \"",

First thing that struck me was that I could see the food preparation area in the open and about 25 chefs working like crazy on different items. When we ordered the 7 course meal, my 7 items were totally different from my partner\\u2019s meal. There were a range of  menu items from exotic meat to regular freshly prepared vegetables.  All of them were tasty and in small quantities.\\nI would definitely recommend this for any special occasion or if you are looking for a unique experience.

            "Wow, from the minute that walk thru the intricate iron wrought door, you are in for a treat. The restaurant is filled with outdoor iron works such as a full gazebo and fence.  This allows the space to have defined areas without closing it off.  Leslie was charming from the very beginning and seemed genuinely excited about the menu and making the most of our experience.  We did the 7 course tasting menu with the wine pairing.  In reality its 14 courses because each person is served 7 different courses, so we of course shared.  The highlights for us were the foie gras and the lamb course. The foie gras was probably the best weve had, with a perfect blend of savory flavors.  The courses are comfortable and we left without being hungry as can be the case with some tasting menus.\"",

They were professional but also were able to joke with us once things became more comfortable. Hearing about the wines, where they came from and what to look for in taste, made the pairings even more delightful.\\nMy favourite part of my dinner was the salmon. The combinations of sweets and acidity in the salad bedding brought so much excitement. There seemed to be so many elements on the plate but they danced together perfectly. My partner swooned over the foie gras. I would absolutely come here again.\"",
            "Came here for our anniversary dinner and we were blown away.  Everything from the service to the wine selection through to the food experience to atmosphere exceeded our expectations.  My wife and I opted for the 7 course meal each which offered us 14 different dishes, we were blown away.  Only one was not to our liking, but that was personal preference (lamb) and nothing to do with preparation or presentation.  We will definitely be back and highly recommend for a complete dining experience.\"",
            "We were seated promptly in one of their booths on a busy Saturday evening.\\n And enjoyed a beautiful dining experience, plus champagne and chocolate happy anniversary notes from our son.\"",
            "Where to begin.\\nWe didn't like the table we were seated at and then couldn't do enough to move us to a great spot (Right next to a waterfall)\\nClose the menu. This is not an \\\"a la carte\\\" restaurant.\\nJust decide 5, 7 or 10 course meal.\\nWine pairing yes or no?\\n\\nWe did the 7 course meal. Wine pairing just adds so much to the fun factor.\\nWe were 2 for a birthday celebration.\\nEach course (Both of your foods and wine are different) comes with an explanation of what you are about to experience.\\nThe sommelier gives you a description of where the wine comes from and it's characteristics.\\nSo impressed with the age of the people bringing our plates and how polished and professional they are. \\nWhen the dessert came it had happy birthday on the plate with no prompt other than on the reservation.\\nThis is not just dining.

            "Date nights are rare for us so when we can get out we go all out! This experience definitely lived up to our hopes and expectations. What's more romantic than a tasting menu for two? We through caution to the wind and were open to try everything and anything the chef prepared. This will always be a very memorable night out and I can still see my husband's face when he read the bill :) It is expensive but worth every dime; at least for a one time special treat for hardworking parents who deserve a night off.\"",
            "Because of Covid, we haven\\u2019t been  dining out, but it was my husband\\u2019s birthday and Stage three in Ontario ushered in the opening of restaurants. Even so, George has a patio so we booked. And it was fantastic. The patio is quiet, private and tables were placed at least 3\\u2019 apart. I started with the lobster. As always, each mouthful is an opportunity to remind your senses how wonderful food can be, replete with flavours that colalesce in new and unusual ways. My husband\\u2019s tuna was rare but slightly warm, the Color gorgeous, the centre of an unimaginable bouquet of textures and tastes. We followed with the duck that was wrapped around a pastry of mushrooms. Again , you want to eat slowly, finding every hint, every suggestion of ingredients that are fresh and flavourful. He had wild boar and a magnificent agnolotti, wishing there had been another. For desert my deconstructed butter tart with cherries was the perfect ending to our celebration. He had lemon meringue that he also fully enjoyed.\\n\\nThe menu has been pared down drastically with fewer offerings in each category. Yet the bar menu is as expansive as always.My  rheisling was excellent, his cocktail beautiful.\\n\\nThe chef here is a magician , knowing how and what to combine. We keep coming back and George never disappoints.\"",
            "We just celebrated a dinner I planned for my cousins bachelorette.   Where do I start?  We were 14 and they suggested the Sand Room which was lovely (and Private which was fantastic for this size group).    Our servers Chris & Alex were such a joy to have as our personal servers and professional at the same time!  I would highly recommend them.  The ambiance was warm and elegant and happy.    The Food:  Our prefixed menu was spectacular.   The beef tenderloin and ahi tuna were to die for!!!  I would go back just for that.   The portions were just the right amount, and the flavors were fresh and fabulous.  All in all, it was a fantastic night and I am so glad we went with this restaurant.\""

            "Overall a worthwhile experience because dining with such an excellent view while exchanging heartwarming conversations is not something you can put a price on. However, the minimum price tag placed on the dinner set meal is absurd at ~$70 CAD (for the food\\u2019s quality and quantity). The fact is that we are paying for the view and not the food.\\n\\nObjectively speaking, the food is decent but not excellent. By itself, it\\u2019s not worth the cost. We tried the mushroom soup, butternut ravioli, chicken, duck pasta and the pan-fried fish - no particular standouts although the ravioli tasted fresh and was more unique than the rest. The duck pasta had too strong\\u002Fheavy of a flavour, giving it a bitter after taste that I could not appreciate.\\n\\nI would only recommend this for those who value the experience to dine at your own pace while appreciating breathtaking views. To me, there was something special you couldn\\u2019t get from just experiencing CN Tower from the viewing gallery.\\n\\nAlso - I recommend going for the dinner and watch the beautiful view change from daylight to sunset to the night light up \\uD83D\\uDE0A\"",
            "It\\u2019s probably high on the to do list for most tourists. We took the fixed price menu for $90 per person. The service and knowledge of the team were first class. We enjoyed the experience. Completed one and a half rotations, there was no rush to finish. The only slight complaint, my wife found the sauce on the buttermilk fried chicken thighs too hot.\"",
            "If you want the most spectacular view in Toronto this is the place to go. Yes, I know it\\u2019s very expensive, but the difference in just touring the Observatory versus having dinner and a very relaxing evening for a little bit more is well worth the trip up to the top of the tower. The minimum per person is $70, just to go up and tour Observatory it was $30. So, for $40 more a person which would be a nice dinner out anyway you have a spectacular view in a rotating restaurant at the top of the CN  tower. Also, the food was excellent and we never felt pressure to order extra wine, desserts or upgrade the menu. Service was excellent too!\"",
            "We made our reservation knowing this was a big tourist spot and our expectations for the food were not high.   We were pleasantly surprised by the quality of our meals, which were excellent.   The service was top notch.  Although the prix fixe menu is rather high, when we figured that the meal entitled us to admission to the observation deck (which we would have otherwise paid for), we felt it was a decent value.  \\nThe tables were far enough apart that we felt safe Covid-wise.  Everyone was observant about wearing masks any time they were not seated at their tables.  The staff, of course, was properly masked at all times.\\nWe could not get a dinner reservation, so we went for a late lunch.   In hindsight, that was a great decision as we got a clear view of the city during daylight and could pick out places we had seen on foot.\"",
            "What can I say - you are sitting in a huge revolving restaurant at the top of a really tall tower at night with Toronto twinkling below you. It's magnificent with a view to die for. The food isn't bad, although not the best I have ever tasted meaning it is a little expensive but the location makes it worth it. The staff are helpful and efficient.\\n\\nIt is difficult to get good photos as the windows reflect so much so drink it all into your memory. You get fast tracked to the top and come down to look through the glass ceilings \\u002F windows so that helps and you can always take your photos there.\"",
            "it had been 9 years since I had eaten in 360 and was taken by a friend.  I was looking forward to the view, but not necessarily the food.  I was very pleasantly surprised.  The smoked salmon was well prepared and attractively presented - not a hard dish to get right, but the attention to detail was evident.  The tenderloin main course was first rate - a superb steak, expertly cooked and the warm apple and sour cherry strudel was a triumphant finish.  This would have been 5 star review had it not been for the very erratic service throughout our dinner.\"",
            "We had a great evening at the 360 but feel that whilst not bad value the food was not quite as good as we wanted and the wine was over priced.\\n\\nReally good experience with security and accessing the restaurant.\\nOur server was good.\\n\\nThe food\\nNeither of us fancied huge starters so we plumped for the 2 course menu.\\n\\nShort rib was really good but came with an extra supplement. \\nThe salmon was over cooked and a little dry.\\n\\nFor sweet the Cheeseboard was good albeit with a supplement again and the Sticky toffee pudding was Ok but not the best.\\n\\nThe views were fantastic as we had great sunshine followed by sunset which made for a great atmosphere.\\n\\nIn summary a must do  but we had better meals elsewhere in the city for less money.\"",
            "Went here on October 3rd for a special occasion with my girlfriend. While booking we had to add all of our allergies and I specified my tree nuts allergy. \\n\\nWe ordered food and it was very good until the waiter came to let me know that the meat that I was eating had nuts in it. No allergens nor nuts were specified in the menu (and I read each plate well to be sure to not get sick). I was lucky that the attack that I had was a mild one and that I had my epipen and other emergency medicines with me (that I had to take).\\n\\nOther than that the food was good and the portions were medium\\u002Fbig. We even got a free dessert for our special occasion.\\nThe view is amazing and something to do once in the life.\\n\\nI just hope that in future the staff will be more respectful of people allergies as they can be extremely severe and they\\u2019re not a joke at all.\"",
            "What a super experience! The food was delicious! I opted for the Prix Fixe option and had the Roast prime rib of beef, was able to swap out the asparagus for green beans, and for dessert had the Chocolate Opera. The views- incredible. I booked at 7:15 and was given a window seat and was able to see the city during the day\\u002Fsunset and nighttime. Since I took the prix fixe option, I had free access to the observation deck- bonus! Amazing experience, really recommend!\"",
            "Fantastic view at a heavy price. Tortoloni was a few under cooked  lumps filled with a tasteless paste for $65.00. Shrimp cocktail 3 pieces $45! . A few dishes were ok but with tip over $600 for 4 people I'd expect some first rate dining. Go for view on the observation deck then find a really good restaurant in Toronto and have 3 excellent dinners for the same amount. Service was pleasant about what you'd expect in a diner.\\n\\n \\n \"",
            "It felt like a special experience to avoid the queues for the tower and go to a \\\"posh\\\" restaurant for lunch. The views were amazing and the food was very good. However I would expect amazing service and it was just average, the server took a long time to take our initial order and the restaurant was not busy. They never asked for individual drink orders when we ordered wine, and forgot one drink. I would go bac.\"",
            "The restaurant is a little pricey given the food that you receive. However, when you factor how expensive it is just to go up the CN Tower it really makes sense to go ahead and pay for the meal as well. The food was OK, not the greatest steak that I\\u2019ve ever had. And we were there a total of three hours as they clearly messed up our order somehow. However the waiter made things right by offering us a free dessert plate which was a nice surprise. Overall I think it is definitely worth the trip up the CN Tower and go ahead and get the meal as well.\"",
            "We went with family while they were visiting. I was pretty underwhelmed by food. For the price, I was expecting a hell of a lot more. I think it's something you do once for the experience. One of the reasons we did the restaurant was due to the cost of tickets for all of us to do the tower. We figured we could do the meal and get \\\"free\\\" admission for tower tour and skip the lines. The view is impressive and family from out of town loved it but I wouldn't do it again. I'd do just the tower and eat somewhere else.\"",
            "Visited here with family, luckily, we were seated right beside a window and timed it purposely so we could experience the sunset. As far as I am aware the restaurant completes 1 - 360 degree turn per hour, but I am sure someone will correct me if this isn't accurate.\\n\\nThe menu is perhaps restricted on choice however the food was pretty good. The price is reflected in the experience as the food isn't worth what is charged. Staff are polite and attentive, and you do not feel rushed to finish dinner.\\n\\nAfter dinner you can head up to the viewing gallery.\\n\\nOverall, a memorable experience and I am glad I went.\"",

            "Booked in for 4:30 dinner as other options were all after 8:30.  4:30 was early but given we had only arrived 2 day prior from Australia we had not yet adjusted to the new time zone. The early booking time did however allow us to secure a window seat. We had hoped to see the view both during the daylight and at night so booked the 3 course option. Despite this we feared we may be rushed though to accomodate a later booking. Nothing could have been further from the truth, the waiter put are fears to rest immediately by repeatedly encouraging us to relax and take our time. The food was of high quality and ample in quantity.  Service was of exceptional  as would be expected. The rotation took approximately one hour and we completed 3 rotations ending facing the setting sun. After our meal we went to the viewing platform and enjoyed the view to finish the night. A great experience from start to finish. This is not a budget night out but is well worth the cost as all elements of the \\u201Cexperience\\u201D will be a lasting memory. Well worth it.\"",
            "We found a 9.15 pm reservation to the restaurant, we decided to take the only available reservation to grab dessert and wine, we didn\\u2019t want to take a heavy meal that late. We arrive to the restaurant and ordered 2 $30 glass of wine an 2 desserts $20 Our waiter told us that we couldn\\u2019t stay at the restaurant if we wouldn\\u2019t order 2 meals. We found very disrespectful and mean the way that the restaurant threats us. Mean services and bad service\\u2026\"",
            "We were excited to dine at the 360 restaurant and arrived to chaos at the entrance to the CN Tower.  There was a huge line up and it took some time and asking attendants where to go.  Needless to say we were faced with another line up.  There is only 2 elevators and each elevator only takes 18 people at a time so had to wait for a few elevators and were 15 minutes late for our reservation.  Nowhere in any of the information provided at the time we reserved said to allow time to get to the restaurant.\\nWe had no sooner ordered and received our drinks when our appetizers were thrust upon us.  Then the main courses arrived soon after leaving little time to finish our cocktails and take in the view.  It says each reservation is allocated 2 hours well it felt like they were trying to get you out in an hour (which was the case).  The seafood platter was not good as the lobster was tough and the mussels were skimpy.  The 2 course for $75 wasn\\u2019t worth $75.  Our waiter Mike R. in finalizing our bill literally threw my receipt at me and couldn\\u2019t even be bothered to thank me.  I left at tip but I regret it along with the $300+ I spent.  We didn\\u2019t even bother spending any more time at the top even though it was included in our reservation.  Avoid the restaurant completely would be my advice.  I received a request from the restaurant for feedback and I shared this experience and you would think I would have heard back but they don\\u2019t care.  Avoid the restaurant.\"",
            "From the moment you walk in you are welcomed with quality customer service. I was not disappointed at all. First you have to make a reservation. I may have been 10 min late to mine and they still accepted me. \\n\\nWhen you first walk in just let them know you are there for the restaurant and that you have reservations. They will verbally direct you where to go. \\n\\nThere is coat check for free and an opportunity to take pictures that make it look like you are in front oh the CN tower. You will be able to view the pics when you are having your meal. \\n\\nFood\\nThe menu consist of 2 courses for $65 or 3 courses for $75. \\nI went with the 2 courses and ordered the duck salad and the Ontario chicken. I was very surprised how much I thoroughly enjoyed both. The portion sizes are decent because I ended up bringing home my leftovers. \\n\\nService\\nThe waitstaff were very professional. They constantly refilled our waters when they noticed we were running low and checked in on us at appropriate times. You do not have to tip but I tipped because I was very pleased with the service. \\n\\nAmbiance\\nNo all of the tables are by the widow. I was just lucky to get a window seat. I went at night at the city looked beautiful. When you are done eating you can go down 2 floors I believe and see Toronto. They also have glass floor tiles where you can see they you are standing over the city. You can also walk outside to view the city but it was too cold so I opted out. \\n\\nOverall\\nThis is a great experience. I would highly recommend others to partake in this experience.\"",
            "This far exceed our expectations. We made a lunch reservation for right for when the restaurant opened for the day. We all got a different one of the Prix Fixe menus. All of us enjoyed our meals other than our son who adventured out and tried a beet based meal.\\n\\nThe service was absolutely incredible. Our waitress was very attentive and shared information about what we were seeing as the restaurant rotated. She also told us a lot about the history of the tower and of Toronto. This was a great experience for our family.\"",
            "This is a must for visiting Toronto and the CN tower - my partner and I had a wonderful time and was my favorite meal during my trip. This is great for fine dining on a smaller budget but still getting the experience - the lunch menu is an even better deal than the prix fixe menu ($10 less for 1 more guaranteed course but a significantly more limited selection). It was not crowded when we went so we did not have to fight for an edge seat and spent so long eating and admiring the skyline we easily completed an entire rotation. Dining at 360 includes admission to the rest of the tower (except for other paid experiences) but the meal and view are the most exciting, lengthy, and memorable parts of the experience. The food itself is great - my chicken was so soft it easily fell off the bone with a twist of the fork and my partner and I rapidly consumed all the vegetables. I wish the soups had more solids but all in all, would absolutely dine here again if I came to Toronto again. \"",

The manager then said that unless we would actually eat the food we must leave. \\nI then explained that I regularly bring clients to the restaurant just for drinks and it has never been a problem before. He still refused to let us stay.\\nI told him that he is an absolute disgrace of a human being and should be ashamed of himself for ruining my mum's 50th Birthday.\\nWe left the restaurant and will not be returning.\\nThis incompetent excuse for a man cost the restaurant money, future business and reputation!\"",

Total wine cost to her:$40 for 1 glass of mediocre wine!!!\\nThe waiter kept arguing with her that he brought her a nine ounce glass, so she just gave in and paid it.

            "We had our dinner there last night. Unfortunately our waiter Hamid was not the best person to have during our wedding celebration. We could hardly understand him and find him rather unfriendly. Perhaps it was because our dinner was booked by travel agent so he knows he will not earn a gratuities from it. On our arrival he took our wine glasses from the table straight away. When I asked why he did that he answer something we couldn't understand so we decided not to order a bottle of sparkling what we originally thought we will celebrate with but we ordered wine by glass. Mine was so bad I questioned him about the wine and asked him to bring the bottle over just to make sure I will not order that wine ever. He brought it over after 10 mins with a smirk on his face and not an offer to change it. Honestly it was a glass from a mixture of probably leftover bottles as it I never had that bad Sauvignon Blanc ever. We had a salmon dish which was totally overcooked and dry but he didnt even ask about it. It was our worst meal and the worst service during 3 months travel through Canada.

            "I booked lunch for 11 April; it\\u2019s not my first time in a revolving restaurant but you never quite get used to the fact you\\u2019re moving slowly as you sip your drinks and eat your food. \\n\\nEating in the 360 restaurant isn\\u2019t for the budget conscious but if you have the resources, I would heartily recommend spending an hour or so in the 360 degrees restaurant - the food is impeccable, the drinks fantastic and the service is exquisite. Could not fault a thing. I ordered off the a la carte menu though the prix fixe offered a number of interesting dishes. There was also an \\u2018indigenous menu\\u2019 which I was tempted by (but I don\\u2019t like gravlax) and was an interesting addition. \\n\\nFollowing lunch, you\\u2019re invited to head down to the observation platform but the views are way better from the restaurant. And you can also drop by the gift shop after for an eclectic range of quality souvenirs.\"",
            "Just looking for something to kill some time and saw and ad for fixed price lunch or dinner switch access to the CN Tower and viewing platform included if you spend $75 each. I made reservations for the next day. The tower was a short walk from the InterContinental Hotel. Basically a separate line and elevator for the 360\\u00B0 restaurant which opened at 1130 avoidingthe long lines for the viewing tower.  Great 8 oz filet meal served with 2 baked potatoes because they were small, ha! ha! Normal size.  Blueberry old fashioned was excellent after I smashed the blueberries which they should have muddled. After eating, we were directed to a staircase to get to the viewing platform.   We didn't really need to do this because the view from our table as it rotated was just as good.  \"",
            "We had a late lunch on 12\\u002F31. It was cloudy but the view was spectacular. They had a few price fix menus to choose from. We were a group of six and everyone was happy with their choices.   The bread is served cold it would be nicer if it were warm. The cesar salad has bacon and was delicious. We started with a seafood platter which was wonderful and fresh. The lamb shank, duck, prime rib and pork tenderloin were all superb. For desert we had the bread pudding and ice cream. The portions for all courses were large and plentiful. The only reason I gave 4 stars was because there were two errors on our bill which were rather significant. We caught it but this \\u201Cmistake\\u201D makes the experience less than perfect.  Make sure you take the stairs to the two lower levels and experience the views. \"",
            "I bring my out of town visitors to CN Tower 360 whenever they have the time to spare.  You have the best view of Toronto, the food you offer is great, and the price is reasonable considering the entrance fee to the Tower if we don't eat at the 360 restaurant.For this visit, Michael was our server.  He made us feel welcome and was attentive without being intrusive.  When he discovered that 3 people in our party were celebrating a milestone birthday, he had the words \\\"Happy Birthday\\\" written in chocolate on our dessert plates - a wonderfully unexpected touch!Keep up the great service and delectable food and I'll keep coming back!\"",
            "Took my wife up to the restaurant, expecting a 300 dollars bill which is fine, but limited menu and what was on the menu when presented wasn't great.  Steak was fatty , the mash runny,  my chicken was labelled as hot,  bland was more how describe it. 14 dollars for a can of cn tower lager which wasn't great. The menu is really limited small kitchen etc I get it. But the quality for what the price is doesn't match we went down stairs and the choice was far better, food looked better prepared  and presented. The upside the staff  were great, views outstanding. The most annoying thing on this trip is the forced gratitude on the bill starting at 15%. Let me choose who,what and price not someone else \"",
            "It's been a long time since my wife and I went to the CN Tower, but we were meeting a friend for lunch downtown, and decided to make an event of it.   Upon arrival you actually feel kind of special.   You have a private elevator ride to the top from your own entrance.   Upon arrival at the top of Toronto, I felt a warm welcome as we were escorted to the table, with a beautiful view of Toronto Harbour and Lake Ontario.  We could see all the way to Niagara Falls.    As we span around slowly in 72 min we saw all of Toronto on the clearest day I can remember.   Now onto the food.  The food is pricey.  Let's get that out of the way.   The fixed price is $90 if you have a dessert.  My lunch was the pork chop that was huge and delicious.  I expected smaller portions but pleasantly surprised.   All our meals exceeded our expectations.  Service was friendly but not overly attentive.   It couldn't have been a better lunch.   Well ... except for the price.   With tip of 20% and a $100 bottle of wine ... it was $535 for 3 people.  However when you factor in the cost of $45 each for going up the CN tower (which reservations at 360 is included), it's not as much a shock, considering how incredible the meal and experience was.   Would I go there for lunch or dinner again ... absolutely.\"",
            "Went to celebrate a birthday with family and took the kids for first time to 360 restaurant and CN Tower.\\nOverall, food was OK, kinda pricey but that is expected.  Tip for MGMT, try not to serve bread that is hard as a rock.... even my kids said the bread was bad.\\nIn order to get the free   observatory floor visit of the CN tower, you needed  to but the prix fixe meal  and not ala carte.\\n\\nThe views of the city was good overall, no clouds this day.   I may go back at a future date for a special occasion, but would not go through the trouble of having dinner there  as I think there are better food options, if not for the view.\"",
            "Visited here last night for my birthday dinner with my wife and family . I have to say the view out was blinding , could see for miles . Now for the restaurant! It\\u2019s very expensive fir what it is, don\\u2019t get me wrong the food was nice but not worth the prices . The drinks were overpriced aswell & beer selection was poor! As for the waiters and expecting tips of around \\u00A360 I thought that was a bit of a liberty . I can understand tipping but when they ask for a minimum of 15% it works out a lot . Would go there again for the view but not for the restaurant.\"",
            "My significant other and I visited the 360 Restaurant in the CN Tower for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  I was looking into visiting the CN Tower for viewing\\u002Fgeneral admission, however when I discovered you can make a reservation for lunch or dinner, and if you order the Prix Fixe menu option, you receive entry to the tower included \\u2013 this seemed like a much better deal!  I am so happy I chose this option, as we were able to have a delicious lunch with fantastic service and a beautiful view, for a reasonable amount more than just entry to the CN Tower.  I would HIGHLY recommend this option.  \\n\\nI was able to make a reservation easily on the CN Tower website a few weeks in advance, and upon our arrival we were whisked to a separate elevator with no line or wait, which took us to the 360 Restaurant.  We arrived 15 minutes prior to our reservation, however we were seated right away with a table next to the windows as I had requested when I made the reservation.  We enjoyed a relaxing and quiet lunch during the 72 minutes it takes for the restaurant to make a full revolution.  \\n\\nThe service was phenomenal throughout the meal.  The menu was very extensive with so many great-looking options.  The focus on local\\u002FCanadian cuisine was fun for us as this was our first visit to Toronto, especially the Indigenous Menu choices.  We opted for the Prix Fixe selection of 2 courses, and chose the following: \\n\\nAppetizers: \\nHot Smoked Fraser River White Sturgeon \\u2013 perfectly cooked fish, great flavor combinations.\\nCanadian Seafood Stew \\u2013 delicious, creamy, and full of perfectly cooked seafood (no skimping here!)\\n\\nMains: \\nRoasted King Cole Duck Breast \\u2013 perfectly cooked, tender, and juicy.  The accompaniments were great; the polenta, greens, and black currant jus were wonderful together. \\nCanadian Red Deer \\u2013 Filet & Sausage \\u2013 again, PERFECTLY cooked filet, and delicious sausage.\\n\\nWith the two courses, we were full by the end of the meal.  As it was my significant other\\u2019s birthday weekend, he was even surprised with a (complimentary) birthday dessert!  \\n\\nWe did try a couple of local craft beers off of the extensive drink menu, which although was mostly focused on wines (the highest wine cellar in the world!), had plenty for us beer drinkers and other NA options (the coffee was great, too).  \\n\\nI would highly recommend indulging in a visit to the 360 Restaurant, especially for a special occasion.  It was a delicious and relaxing meal, with fantastic views and service.  You won\\u2019t regret splurging \\u2013 especially when you take the restaurant-only elevator down to the other viewing floors and realize how crowded and loud the rest of the tower can be.  Thank you to the employees of the 360 Restaurant for a wonderful experience, which was a highlight of our trip to Toronto.\"",
            "We just concluded a wonderful return to Toronto over the holiday weekend.  We were lucky to get a 4 30 p.m. reservation on a Sunday night.  If we booked earlier than 5 days in advance we might have been able to see the sunset.  My wife and I ordered the 3 course Prix Fixe meal, and our daughter had the same from the children\\u2019s menu.  We loved the Wedge Salad, mussels, Pork Chop, chicken, Chocolate Mousse, and ice cream.  Beautiful views of the city and lake on the slow rotating platform.  Access to the viewing tower as well.  This is a must do while visiting Toronto.  Service and drinks were great too.\"",
            "We had reserved at 360 as soon as it opened back lunch. We went we my family of 4, 2 adults and 2 teens. We all enjoyed our experienced.\\n\\nWe felt COVID protocols were well respected. During the 2hrs of our meal, we went around town about 1 and a half tour I would say. It was a great day and we could see all our surroundings beautifully.\\n\\nOur server was excellent and very attentive. Our water glasses were refilled efficiently, cutlery changed between services, our wine glasses topped off. He paid attention to all of us and had good conversation.\\n\\nOur teens had 2 nice options for 'mocktails', which, although small, they really enjoyed. We had the 360 blend in red that worked with our meal choice. We all had the prix fixe menu. We like that we didn't have to select the same prix fixe. For instance, one daughter had the appetizer and entree; while the other had an entree and a dessert.\\n\\nAll 4 appetizers that we tried were amazing.  Our preference would be the smoked salmon and the shrimp chowder.  For our main meal, I found the beef prime rib too large, but hubby was happy to finish for me!  His venison was excellent, with a very good cook.\\n\\nDesserts were also large and we shared. Thanks to the restaurant for a special mention of my daughter's birthday; and of a special gift for our anniversary.\\n\\nWe would definitely recommend.\"",
            "I visited 360 Restaurant with a friend in November 2022 to celebrate her belated birthday.  The view was fantastic, the food was delicious and every server and other staff member we encountered was professional, friendly, efficient and helpful.  I would highly recommend 360 Restaurant for a special occasion or a fun night out.\"",
            "We have eaten here many times but it was my cousin and his wife's 1st time so we wanted it to be special and the 360 restaurant and staff pulled out all the stops and made our evening one to remember.  A window table , birthday wishes for the birthday boy and anniversary wishes for my cousin and wife. The service was impeccable from entry to exit. The food as always was out of this world as were the cocktails and drinks all topped off with the best view in Toronto.  Bread and whipped maple butter, butternut squash ravioli,  forged mushroom chowder, mussel pot and house smoked salmon started off our feast followed by braised lamb shanks and chicken supreme all topped off by a full array of desserts. Apple of my eye cocktails were unbelievable.  This restaurant never fails to make your night special,  see photos... THANK YOU EVERYONE IN THE 360...\"",
            "My wife surprised me with a delightful dinner at the 360 restaurant. The service was great, the food delicious and delivered pretty quickly after each course. We have the 3 course fixed price menu and it was simply delicious! The starters of gnocchi and beef tartar were delivered quickly and not long after that was done we received our cornish hen and mushroom risotto. Packed full of flavour and the portions were perfect. Once again timing on dessert was perfect. Strawberry shortcake and a peach upside down cake. They accommodated a food allergy. \\n\\nSimply put, a perfect evening with an amazing view! \"",
            "Visited with my wife in January 2020 for my birthday treat. \\n\\nOur reservation was for 4.30pm so we turned up at about 4pm. We had to wait until about 4.25 before being let up in the lift. We left our coats at the restaurant check in which was free.\\n\\nOn arriving at the restaurant we were checked in. I requested a window table and was shown to a two-seat table by the window. It was about 4.40 when we sat down. The weather was clear and sunset was at 5pm. Seeing the city grow dark and then gradually come to life again with lights was amazing.\\n\\nThe tables were rotating slowly at what I estimated at 1 full rotation an hour so you get to see the entire 360 degrees during your meal.\\n\\nOur waiter was superb and we were not at all rushed. \\n\\nWe both had the Prix Fixe with starters and main. I had the prime rib and my wife had the lamb shank. Both were superb. I have read a lot of reviews here that say the food was not good but all I can say is that our meal was superb with the rib especially so. Of course, it is expensive... it is at the top of the CN Tower! But it isn't just about the food. You don't have a meal at the CN tower just because you want to go out to dinner. It is a special place and it is the food, the view and the experience you pay for. We felt our meal was expensive if you just consider the food (in spite of it being a great quality) but overall, we felt that it was worth what we paid when you consider where it is.\\n\\nHighly recommended for a special occasion or if visiting Toronto as a tourist.\"",
            "My daughters only wish for her 9th birthday was to have dinner at the 360 Restaurant at the CN Tower. I blind folded her until we arrived and when she got there, she was ecstatic. \\n\\nI had pre booked our reservation and entry prior to arrival to make things more smooth. Check in was easy and we were able to get in with no issues within 10 minutes of arrival. Due to the pandemic, we had to wear masks, which was fine, and we had to line up outside by booked time slot to avoid crowding inside, which was expected. Safety measures were in place and everyone was very accommodating.\\n\\nThe restaurant allowed us to bring in balloons for my daughter, which was nice. They waiters also came by and sang happy birthday to my daughter, from a distance. The food was amazing (pasta with meat sauce, the steak and the pork chops) We also got a bottle of merlot which was great. \\n\\nThe waiters were prompt, pleasant and made my daughters day awesome. There was a place where you can take souvenir pictures with a background of the CN Tower, which they brought to your table if you wanted to purchase @ $40\\u002F2 pictures with a picture holder frame.\\n\\n3 meals, 2 adults, 1 child, a bottle of wine and a virgin drink totaled $380, plus the view of the entire city of Toronto, was nothing short of an AMAZING night for my princess.\"",
            "It was a double birthday dinner for my spouse and sister in law . We ordered the 2 course deal , which included an entrance to the CN tower observation deck. Since we know the restaurant is a Michelin rated type , we were surprised that one , it is not the strict fine dining but a rather casual one. Then the prices seem reasonable, considering the quality of food and the ambiance . I am uploading some photos. Shout out to Michael our head server who did make the birthday celebration an extra memorable for my loved ones. No worries about the wait time , you are there to enjoy the moment . And of course don\\u2019t forget to check out their very extensive bar and alcohol selection on display . Don\\u2019t mind the vertigo issues as well .\""

Build your own eggs benny, what a great idea and so obvious but not many places do it.  I put brie cheese, avocado and bacon in mine, it was absolutely fantastic.  Side order of sausage could have been a bit bigger but in the end so much food I did not mind.  Eggs slightly cooked more than I like it but my meal was so good it made no difference.  For me, the 'piece de resistance' was the home made spicy sauce on the table, it was spicy as suggested and went great with the eggs. So good I bought 4 bottles!  They have some interesting other things on the menu, but that will have to wait until next time.  Get here early though, the lineups can be long.

            "We frequented Lady Marmalade at their original location many times and always loved having breakfast there. In November they re-opened in a new location on Broadview near Dundas. I\\u2019m happy to report that the food is as good as ever. Their bennies are delicious and come in several different creative combinations of ingredients. Their bread pudding is unique every day. In our recent visit 3 different flavors were offered instead of the previous 1 or 2. Our preferred breakfast is to share an order of bennies and a bread pudding between two people for a perfect breakfast combination of savory and sweet.  \\n\\nOther improvements since the move are more dining space, accepting debit and credit (no more cash only) and offering beer, wine, mimosas and Caesars. Unfortunately, I didn\\u2019t really enjoy the new decor very much and realize how much the old quirky, funky decor was part of the overall experience. The new space is too minimalist and sterile to my taste and the long narrow room configuration upstairs is not very appealing. Lines are even longer than they used to be. Expect at least a 45 minute wait at peak times on weekends. \"",

            "My wife and I recently came back from Barcelona and are \\u201Cfood\\u201D people. We like to hunt out restaurants that are delicious but not grossly overpriced. LaVinia\\u2019s was tasty, but for a 4 tapas meal for two with two drinks cost us $95 before tip. In Barcelona, we experienced better quality food, for much cheaper. In Barca you can have 8 tapas meal, which are smaller in individual portions, but more food overall, and a bottle of wine for 70 EURO with gratuity included. We went out looking for a similar experience, but did not get it here. In addition, the tapas selection is only about 12, whereas in Spain there are about 20-25. I will say though, the service here is exceptional, the chef came out to make sure we liked everything and it was an overall excellent vibe. LaVinia would easily be a 4 Star if it wasn\\u2019t as costly as it is. $15 for one sausage sliced up and served in a ratatouille just doesn\\u2019t sit well with me. \"",
            "Quaint Spanish restaurant- if you love seafood make a stop here. \\n\\nWould highly recommend the paella de\\nMarisco - wonderfully flavoured with a variety of seafood. \\n\\nFor appetizers we had the pulpo (octopus) which was quite fresh - soft and only slightly chewy, it had a heavy smoky taste but quite delicious; and the chorizo with clams and white beans - this was extraordinarily good. Soak up all the sauce with the fresh bread served. \\n\\nIf getting the paella would recommend only 1 appetizer as the portions are generous. House red wine was lovely as was the service. \\n\\nWe called ahead and got a table for 2 at 8:30pm - but the restaurant was full and we were very lucky - would recommend a reservation.\"",

            "Recently visited Spain and enjoyed delicious local food from some small non-descript establishments. The food here at LaVinia is very reminiscent of the food we enjoyed in Spain. Stuffed piquillo peppers were flavourful and interesting. The quail appetizer was beautifully grilled and had such a great taste. The seafood paella was excellent, with plentiful seafood and served piping hot from the oven in a paella pan. Rice was slightly more wet than that enjoyed in Costa del Sol, but excellent. Smallish dining room with cosy decor and ambiance, almost like being in Spain. Servers are friendly and knowledgeable. Good selection of wines by the glass, very good Spanish wines.\\nA little out of the way, but a worthwhile dining experience. More enjoyable than Patria.\"",

The Paella Morisco was large [several tables were sharing between 2], varied components and full of flavour.\\nService was excellent - attentive without being intrusive, clear answers on questions of portion size and wine.\\nChef came out for a quick visit.\\nAnd we weakened for a Milk 'pudding' - suprisingly good given the constituents.\\nWe'll be back.\"",
            "LaVinia is one of the few restaurants in Toronto offering authentic Spanish fare. My wife and I came here for our anniversary and I have been craving for a good Paella. The last restaurants we tried in New York, Sevilla was okay but did not fare enough to what I was used to. Having Basque friends who do catering, I became familiar on what to look out for in Spanish cuisine and since then have on the search for a great, tasty Paella. \\n\\nLaVinia is cozy restaurant with wooden interiors and red-painted walls much like the Spanish flag. The staff was nice and quick to seat us. We were handed the menu and my wife and I ordered the sopa de ajo, paella valenciana and the fish of the day.\\n\\nSince I do not eat pork, I requested if they can cook it in utensils that have not been with used with the said ingredient and they were very respectful. Fernando, the chef and owner, even came to assure me that it's nothing to worry about. \\n\\nThe first to come was the sopa de ajo and it was warm, creamy and not overwhelming in its garlic taste. The paella soon came after and after one bite, I was hooked. This was the paella that I had been looking for, perfectly cooked bomba rice, juicy and moist chicken and the hint of saffron. It was divine and felt like the first time I had an authentic homecooked paella years back. The fish of the day was surprisingly good. I mean after having Paella, my standards for flavour were now higher but its taste took me by surprise. It was perfectly cooked and the fish retained its moisture with a simple, clean taste and yet, good.\\n\\nLast we had was the tartufo and it was okay but at this point, I was not complaining. I did not come here for desserts anyway. It was the paella that we came here for and finally found one close by.\\n\\nWe could not finish the large portions, so we ended up bringing them home to my kids. As soon as we got home, my son smelled the paella and next thing I knew, it was cleaned off and he was asking me when we could order from LaVinia again. We're definitely coming here again.\\n\\nThank you, Fernando and your staff, for making our anniversary a memorable one.\"",
            "So my friends and I have been coming to LaVinia a few years now and they have been delivering consistent fantastic service and delicious food.  We had the crab croquettas, lamb shank, goat cheese with spinach and a few of the shrimp dishes.   I\\u2019ve tried most of the dishes over the years and they have been consistent in its flavor and scrumptiousness.  You will definitely find yourself grabbing that piece of bread and sopping up some of the sauce cuz it\\u2019s just that good!!\\n\\nIt is a small family run business with Chef Fernando in the back with his wife and Jaime his son in the front.\\n\\nIt is authentic, warm and familial place where  there is no rush to turn tables.\\n\\nJust go!

            "The endless glowing reviews and the extraordinary high ranking by tripadvisor caused us to go to LaVinia Restaurant recently. \\nWe were greeted charmingly and taken to a table near the back of the simple but pleasant enough room. From our viewpoint we saw the whole room. The servers were strikingly amiable and genial as they moved about the room. Clients were charmed.\\nWe ordered from the tapas menu. White anchovies were quite tasty.(16.75) The portion was small. The Veal Carpaccio with Manchego and Mushrooms (18.75) looked very nice spread out on the plate. It was sliced so thinly however that there was very little there when it came to eating it. The Grilled Calamari with Chilli oil, (15.75) were mushy. My wife wouldn't eat hers after the first bite. I ate half of mine. Next, Spanish Chorizo Saut\\u00E9ed with Clams and White Beans. (16.75.) Tasty, but felt tired and reheated. Finally, Baked Spinach with Goat Cheese. (16.75)  Some wilted spinach leaves with a piece of mild warmed cheese. Dull. Flavorless. Because of the endless effusive reviews I expected something special from these dishes. A chef's touch. But it was all rather ordinary. And given the portions and the pricing, not worth it.\\nBut the real concern came with trying to order wine. Our waiter gushed that the owner and his son import there own special wines directly from Spanish producers. We ordered a Spanish white for $60.00. It arrived in a bottle with a label that said Tempranillo. For those unfamiliar with that grape, it is RED. The waiter brushed that off saying the winery made a mistake. \\\"The wine was white after all\\\". He assured us it was very good. For 30 years my wife ran a wine importing company. We are both quite practiced at evaluating wine quality. My wife sent hers back after one taste. It was of very low quality. We cancelled the bottle and had a glass of something else that was also of indifferent quality.  I estimate that, that $60.00 bottle would have cost them very little. The mark up was clearly excessive.  I noted that one of the earlier reviewers commented on their unreasonable charge for Sangria. Surprisingly few reviewers make any comments on the wines.Perhaps they just don't understand.\\nBy offering wines that are privately sourced, their clients are totally in the dark on the  cost. I believe they are selling low level wines, and gouging on their mark ups.\\nBut the wine service does have lots of flourish and charm.\\nSo what is the miracle? Well the endless gushy reviews and ratings they manage to produce, from what is essentially a rather ordinary restaurant. This restaurant has been hugely over rated in the trip adviser rankings. Toronto has many many excellent restaurants. Lavinia is not one of them and should be ranked much lower than it is. It is an example of style succeeding over substance.\"",

The menu is varied; plenty of tapas. We tried the grilled calamari and the veal carpaccio, both of which were good. One of their signature dishes is the paella, which was fantastic. We split an order and it was a very generous portion size. The staff were friendly without being annoying. The owner makes a point of circulating among the guests to say a quick hello. My only issue is the price of the wines. I feel they're a bit steep, but that is my complaint at most restaurants!\"",

From the first glass of Cava, through delicious and varied tapas selections, and then, the specials of the day - we dined in true Spanish style. Fernando serves the freshest seafood, seasonal vegetables and mouthwatering chops - paellas too! The plates are attractively presented and the attentive wait staff describe each dish - almost with a reverence!. Wines are a specialty and the staff are knowledgeable  - excellent pairings with the food on offer. The overall feel of the restaurant is one of friendliness, commitment to good service and the creation of fine food.

That was just fine, we had a bread basket and good wine to keep us busy while waiting!  When the paellas arrived they both looked wonderful and they tasted even better - they were delicious and perfectly cooked.\\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the flan, which was definitely more of a fabulous creme caramel.  It was probably the best creme caramel we've eaten outside of Europe!\\n\\nAs others have said, the chef comes out to chat with the diners - a very nice touch.\\n\\nThe only negative I would have is the price of the tapas.

Plus the wine pairing.\\n\\nEach dish had a distinctive overall note to it: be it fresh or lemony or earthy, all of them were complex, interesting and making you wonder what's the next dish about, what flavours will have in it, making you ask for more. And this somewhat misterious note was, on purpose, kept throughout the evening: the list of dishes (flavours) being served was handed out to me at the end of the experience in a sealed envelope. The quality of the dishes matches the one of the service: wine glasses were discarded as soon as I was done with them, new clean glasses were brought at the right moment, the dish was described accurately and each wine had a story and matched the dish perfectly.\\n\\nThis is a pricey experience, but it's something definitely worth trying out. And I believe the price was well worth the overall experience, the quality of flavors, the wines and the service.\"",
            "I had always wanted to try Alo since I've heard great things about it and I also really enjoyed Aloette so I decided to try my luck at reserving a table for my birthday.  So on the the first Tuesday at 10 am (October to book for Nov and Dec seats), I completely lucked out and was able to get a table for 2 at the Kitchen Counter for 7pm.  The restaurant is tucked away on Spadina and when you enter at the ground level, you will be greeted immediately and wished happy birthday after the greeter checked her computer.  The elevator ride does not match with what we were about to experience because once the doors opened, we were transported into a different world.  We were greeted again and asked if we wanted to have a drink before we were seated.  We passed on that and waited in the front area for a short while before we were seated at the kitchen counter.  The view was great - we could see the entire kitchen!  Our server was super attentive and friendly.  We are not huge wine drinkers so we didn't go with the pairing menu but did a 2 white & 1 red glass combo which was recommended by our sommelier.  We asked her to help us pick out the wines and she seemed reluctant to do so until she asked us some questions about what kinda of wines do we like\\u002Fusually drink. I'm not going to into every single dishes' details but every single dish was prepared with care, thought and detail.  Some dishes were: oysters, scallops, beef, venison, tuna, egg dish and 4 desserts including a small chocolate cake!  Desserts were very light but we couldn't finish a couple so we asked them to pack it away so we can have them later!! The tastes we experienced was absolutely delightful.  Everything worked as a whole and the serving pace was good (~ 2.5 end to end).  I actually started to getting full around course 7-8!  A couple of stand out\\u002Fexceptional experiences during the dinner:  1)  cutlery placement depending on whether you were left or right handed 2) my husband needed to take a call so he left the table as we were being served a dish but instead of putting both plates down, they pulled both plates back (to keep warm) so that we can both eat at the same time when he was finished his call  3) since this was a set 13 course tasting menu, they couldn't accommodate for any allergies or dietary restrictions so going into the dinner I knew there was a chance that I would be served something that I wasn't fan of -- foie gras.  I did try a bit but decided to give the rest to my husband. The staff caught that right away and came over immediately to ask if everything was ok and whether I wanted an additional dish.  I said it's all fine, I just am not a fan of foie gras.  However, they still went ahead and prepped a sablefish for BOTH of us!! AND it was Chef Kriss who did the final check on our fish before it was served!! I can't believe they actually saw my husband take my foie gras and to go above and beyond to prep another dish for us! We were so happy with the overall experience.  We have had tasting menus in other \\\"top notch\\\" Toronto restaurants which completely fell short so we were really hoping Alo wasn't going to disappoint and they certainly did not!!

We were presented with on point details about each dish, and wine pour which added to the experience. Cutlery, and glasses were changed with each plate.

            "I had a great experience dining with friends at ALO. We were a group of 5 with various dietary restrictions and preferences. ALO was able to accommodate us all and the several course tasting menu was great!

It makes the meal slightly more expensive compared to ordering a bottle of wine... but so worth out.

            "Rightly rated as one of the best restaurants in Canada, we love the modern twist on French cooking. The friendly service, nice view and pretty old building just add to the experience. You can even enjoy a cocktail before you eat. Highly recommended.\"",
            "From the arrival greeting, to the brief wait in the bar, to the seating in close proximity to the food prep area, to the well choreographed service, to the tasty morsels presented for our dining pleasure and the wine pairing, the experience was extraordinary. Not sure why there is no star?\"",
            "I admire restaurant reviewers , my favourite is Giles Coren , how do you make sense of some of the experiences you have just been through. He manages it with humour and sharp observation. I will do my best here.\\n\\nSo we finally did Alo. Everyone drones on about how difficult it is to get in. It's not that bad , just need to have signed up to Tock reservation system and be ready at 10 am on the designated day every couple of months. You then have to move fairly fast and pick a date and time that comes up and book fast.\\n\\nYou enter a what looks like an a scruffy apartment block and take lift up. We had chosen the tasting menu at the bar\\u002F chefs rail and also chose to do the wine pairing. Once seated things are fairly brisk. We made the mistake of ordering a glass of champagne to start things off. Two issues here as the champagne was corked and it messed with their system as wine pairing selections starting stacking up quickly.\\nThe wine pairing was interesting for a while and some of the wines were unusual. However there was an issue , with one exception there were all white. I think there are enough interesting red wines out there that would pair with the food offered.To have glass after glass of white wine does get a bit boring.\\n\\nSo let's talk about the food. Goodness, how much effort must it take the prep the seeming endless courses with the accompanying sauces , reductions and pretty bits. When you think about the effort ,anything you pay is a bargain even at their healthy prices. Everything was delicious . My favourite was the oyster dish and the potato dish. I could have licked the plate clean to get every last drop of whatever yumminess made up the dish. Here's the issue I was never sure exactly what everything actually was . More on that shortly. My wife particularly liked the scallop dish.\\n\\nSo sitting at the chefs rail you are faced with two particular views. Firstly the poor souls assembling all the dishes. It must get a bit boring spending all evening shouting \\\"Oui chef \\\"obediently as the orders are called out , assembling order after order of the same thing. However they do a fine job. Once prepared the food gets sent to the pass. Three chefs are present there who do final tweaks and inspections before they go out. Occasionally chef owner Patrick Kriss  comes, out all steely eyed then disappears again. I wonder where he goes . His office to check reviews , thinking up next dishes or kicks back to watch Raptors on his office TV ? \\n\\nSo to the service. Lots of reviews suggest the restaurant would win a Michelin star if an inspector deigned to visit Canada. Who knows maybe they do already but can't find any restaurant to award a star to . In case they do visit I am not so sure Alo would get a star as whilst the food is very good , a more complete experience would probably be needed.\\n \\nSo here is the issue for me , a variety of servers bang out your food and rush through a mumbled explanation of what you are about to eat by rote. Poor souls they have repeated it a thousand times , however I gave up up asking for things to be repeated as i could not keep doing that for every single course. When you add that to the gang of three at the pass in their own private world the atmosphere feels a bit cold at times.\\n\\nSo to be constructive here is my suggestion based on some top restaurants I have been lucky enough to go to. Key is a bit more banter between staff and guests. Gang of three could perhaps have some quick chats with guests at chefs rail. They seem to have some spare time when they spin their ever ready tweezers around and shoot the breeze. Example is Canoe chef's rail. Chefs have a laugh and a chat with guests at chefs rail and bring a morsel not expected to try. Marcus , London UK , servers have elegant but personal chat with customers that feels an  unrushed yet interested chat about the food you are about to receive. See also Smyth Chicago, apart from stunning food , sommeliers balances wine pairing much better , even leave pairing bottle on table if you want to try more before they bring next one. In reality you can only drink so much so few people over do it. Go really fancy and visit Ritz restaurant in London , yet even there serving team seem to be able to find a good balance of friendly chat with informed and interesting explanation about food you are being served.\\n\\nSo here is the key question , would I go back ? Probably yes , but not at chef's rail and at a table with fewer courses and my own choice of wine. \\n\\nGreat place, especially for Canada , so near yet so far from a true Michellin starred restaurant if that matters to anyone , probably not !\"",
            "I was unable to get a reservation for the dining room\\u002Ftasting menu, but we were able to walk-in and order a la carte in the small bar.

            "We loved the food! Great presentation and friendly staff. Had the six course menu at the bar room for $120 with wine pairing that was worth the price.

All\\u2019s great, except the entrance that leads to an old decrepit elevator that gave us the impression we\\u2019re going to a warehouse. A downer for such a great restaurant. However, as we went there for the food, it was worthwhile.\"",
            "I came here with my wife for the extended tasting menu over the kitchen counter. Food and atmosphere was fabulous, we had 11 courses in total and got full around the 8th before getting desert. BUT, the deserts were sooo good that we finished them anyways. \\n\\nOnly minor complaint would be it can be extremely difficult to get a table, but given they only have around 7-8 seats open per night and it was so tasty, I will come back for sure.\"",

Considering the high quality of being a Michelin restaurant, I readily accepted. We both loved our experience.\\n\\nThey saved a special corner table (# 26) for us, overlooking the rest of the bar area.\\n\\nFood was a 5-course menu for $120 ea. Drinks were an additional $189, for a total of $429 CAD.\\n\\nJoy, our server took great care of us. Food was exquisite.  We would love to return.\\n\"",
            "This was a fun date night but I am going to critical because Michelin stars are around the corner.\\n1. The restaurant is located in Spadina, not a very glamorous welcome. The elevator looks like the service elevator and really needs to be updated. \\n2. Press 3 and you head up to the restaurant. \\n3. The bar was very nice , perfect for a date night as we were having. Hooks for handbags for the ladies, nice glass wear, a nice atmosphere. \\n\\n4. The menu is self explanatory. The cocktails, I think I chose wrong as mine tasted like cough syrup. Not too much finesse in the cocktail preparation, having just finished a long euro trip, I think the creativity could be further explored and the bartender spilt and remixed my drink twice before even serving it. \\n5. We chose the wine paired menu, now this is my real bone of contention. \\nA) the red paired with the most beautifully prepared  beef tenderloin almost ruined the taste. I know it\\u2019s summer but they need to change the red wine pairing. I took two sips and left the rest. My husband asked for a change and the Syrah was equally disappointing. \\nB) the scallops were delicious but again disappointingly paired with wine. The pop corn flavoured rice, was odd but different. I still enjoyed it \\nC) a Sauterne would have paired much better with that elegant fois gras (probably the most amazing preparation you have ever tasted ) \\nFor such high standard and quality of food the wine was sub par and perhaps there needs to be two wine menus, a sommeliers selection and a premier choice and the sommelier should be able to pour 2-3 oz of wine exact, it alway looks very bad when a sommelier pours one glass higher that the other person consistently through 6 courses. \\n\\nService ; the waiters seemed new and nervous, dropping cutlery and not impeccable. The table was only wiped after the steak. \\n\\nI enjoy fine dining and we would definitely return for another date. However I would be more vocal about my preference to the wine list.\\n\\nPerhaps maybe encourage a dress code. It\\u2019s so awkward being sat all dressed up and then flip flops and shorts sit right next to your table.\"",

The servers are outstanding, well trained and a well honed team. They are attentive but never obtrusive. The food is beautifully presented and delicious.

As someone who doesn't do fine dining often I can honestly say this is worth every penny and I hope it always gets the appreciation it deserves. \"",
            "Honest review on 11 course tasting in dining room.\\nLet\\u2019s start with the absolute best part of the experience - wine pairings and sommelier. Our sommelier for the evening was Christopher Sealy. His passion for the trade, deep knowledge of the products, and ability to pair the wine was absolutely incredible! In fact, the only reason I would want go back is  to experience this wine tasting and listen to the interesting history of wine. \\nOverall service was really good, servers were very knowledgeable and attentive. Delicious drinks from the bar. \\nOut of 11 courses, we can honestly say that 3 were really enjoyable (risotto, asparagus dish and lamb), 6 were just ok, and the 2 deserts were the total flop. Our Dover sole dish was over cooked and dry. I have a huge sweet tooth, and think I can eat a dessert just about anywhere, but this was just bad.. the jalape\\u00F1o and lime concoction made both my husband and I gag, and the rhubarb dessert plate was just not good. \\nOverall, wine tasting is a 100000% worth it and is what carried the night for us, the food that evening however, does not match the price tag and the hype. \"",

            "My wife and I have had the pleasure of dining in some wonderful restaurants, including Joel Robuchon's Restaurant Jamin in 1992-- and still the best dining experience ever for us.  For Alo, I got on the waiting list as I wanted to take my wife here as a surprise for our 55th anniversary.  We were fortunate to get in, which is not easy, and thoroughly enjoyed the 10-course blind menu (there is no printed menu).  There is also a way to do a 6-course version in the bar area.  It can be tricky to figure out details on the website, so suggest call.  I'm not a fan of the word \\\"foodie,\\\" but it you have an appreciation for extremely tasty and beautiful courses, you will love this place. Vegan or vegetarian- suggest don't go here. All the staff work together as a team; you are not assigned a server. They have this part figured out as well.  The place is not stuffy, no dress code, some wore pretty casual clothes, or you can dress up.   They do send you away with a souvenir menu as you depart !\"",

We had their fresh rolls, which were tasty. For mains we had the massaman curry (\\\"Sorry, we can't make the lunch special curry spicy\\\") and the Penang curry. The massaman came with a 1\\u002F2-cm layer of oil at the top, the onions were CRUNCHY and there was way too much cardamom. The penang was good, but also had a ton of oil at the bottom of a \\\"bowl\\\" that was poorly matched to the food it contained. \\n\\nI'm afraid that was my last trip to KSR.

I remembered trying that appetizer on my first visit to the original location of Khao San Road as I had heard great things about it back then.\\n\\nThe Fresh Rolls arrived first.  Housemade chicken sausage was wrapped with lettuce, carrot, Thai basil, and mint with rice paper into individual pre-cut rolls.  There was a container of chili tamarind sauce topped with fresh roasted peanuts that accompanied the dish.\\n\\nThis was a very refreshing and simple roll.  I liked that it tasted light and I didn\\u2019t need to dip much of the sauce for the rolls to taste good.\\n\\nThe Squash Fritters were made with kabocha squash, wild ginger, lemongrass, fresh makrut lime leaves, red curry, and egg.  It was as crispy as I remembered and as tangled as I remembered.  It\\u2019s such a good appetizer for sharing.\\n\\nD\\u2019s order of the Pad See Ew contained wide rice noodles, Chinese broccoli, egg, garlic, oyster sauce, soy sauce, and with a substitution of beef instead of the original options of chicken, veggies and tofu, or veggies.\\n\\nWe didn\\u2019t stay very long after we were done our food as it became more difficult to hear each other over the table as more people had showed up after 6 p.m.\\n\\nThe service here was pleasant.

Bummed out that they were out of the beef salad, as the Nom Tok is always one of my benchmark dishes.  Ordered the Pad Gra Prao with Beef \\\"8 Extreme Thai Spicy\\\" and the Khao Soi w\\u002Fchicken \\\"6 Thai Spicy\\\".  20 minute wait, so I headed upstairs to the bar for a cocktail.  Had the privilege of meeting Julia, one of the coolest bartenders I have ever hung out with.  I give her my vote for employee of the year.  As someone not from Canada, she made me feel welcome and like a regular by the time I left.  I'll go out of my way to have her make me another drink!  She made me a fantastic craft cocktail, some bourbon based drink with a name like \\\"Hard to Describe\\\" (but I'm sure that's not it...).  Smoked wood chips give the glass fragrence and this drink was outstanding!  Met a regular at the bar that was another local bartender\\u002Fphotographer\\u002Fvideographer that befriended me and said I had to try the Sriracha Fried Chicken.  Ordered that to-go from Julia and was going to take wayyyy too much back to the Hilton.  \\n\\nBottom line - I'll come back for the excellent food, but I'll go out of for the great bar service!\"",

            "Khao San Road is a buzzing hub of activity. This impression is set the moment you walk into the restaurant. Since reservations are not a thing here, a wait is usually predicted. In our case it was forty five minutes that was spent in the upstairs Bang Sue bar, sipping Thai Ceasars with Madjurad hot sauce, served by the friendly Sina, in a atmosphere not unlike one you would find in Thailand. The grilled Pork Jowl with crying tiger sauce, complemented the drinks adequately. The meal that followed downstairs in the dining area had flavours that were more than representative of its roots. My favourite was the Pad Phed Pha which, if I recollect, was the special of the day. If you feel the need, as we did, to refresh your memories of Thailand, Khao San Road is the way to do it.\"",
            "This place does a land office business. We had to wait 10 minutes for a table at 6 on Tuesday evening. Most of the tables were high stools, not particularly comfortable. One of us ordered Mussaman Curry and said it was not very good and not authentic, one of us ordered a fried rice salad, a small plate that was well done. The third order was for a Pad Thai with tofu, which was good. The price for these three items, which is all we ordered, including tax and tip was $59, which I thought was outrageous. Certainly not value for money. We have dined at local Thai restaurants which served better food at two thirds of the cost. \"",

            "We love Thai food so we were looking forward to eating at this restaurant. There was somewhat of a long wait so we built up an appetite and ordered a bunch of dishes. While the food was good, it wasn't the best Thai food we've ever had. Also, this restaurant felt a bit more \\\"westernized\\\" compared to the mom and pops restaurants that we frequent. That said, it was a solid meal and all of the dishes were tasty.\"",
            "I\\u2019ve had Pai bookmarked in the event I visit Toronto and this time, I finally got to try it. I was excited because I love Thai food, and it seemed authentic but unfortunately, it fell short. I\\u2019ve read there\\u2019s always a wait and they don\\u2019t accept reservations so we decided to go at around 1 PM on a rainy Sunday. We were quoted 45 min wait but only ended up waiting about 25. We ordered a drink at the bar while we waited. I had the Thai mojito and hubby had the Lowry. Both tasted pretty similar even though one was rum and one was gin. It\\u2019s probably because it was sickeningly sweet, so the sugar was all we tasted. \\n\\nFor food, a lot of items weren\\u2019t available until dinner time, so if there\\u2019s something specific you want to try, keep that in mind. We started with fried garlic shrimp, which was probably the only thing we liked. It was perfectly fried\\u002Fcrispy, and the tamarind dipping sauce it came with was nice. For drinks, hubby got a Thai iced tea which also way too sweet. For my main, I went with the Khao Soi with beef. The beef was flavorless - I had to dunk it in the chili oil it was served with. The broth was too salty. I don\\u2019t think I was even able to eat half the bowl. I wish it came with more pickled mustard greens. Hubby had the Gaeng Hunglay (sweet and sour garlic-ginger curry with braised oxtail). The flavor wasn\\u2019t bad but overall still a bit too salty. It could have used way more rice.\\n\\nMaybe the dinner experience is different\\u002Fbetter? But it\\u2019s not worth the wait\\u002Ftrek\\u002Fmoney for a lunch.\"",
            "Arrived around 5 pm on a Thursday night and it was packed, but we were able to get a table and noticed that the place is huge. \\nService was quick and I was expecting something delicious... Pad Thai with shrimp was more sweet than spicy even though I requested medium. Wife ordered Tom Yum Kung and it was okay, likewise for the rice unless you like it on the hard side. \\n\\nGot some good pics, but that\\u2019s it...\"",
            "I was hesitating between the qualification \\\"poor\\\" and average.I ate here solo February 23th.  It was crowded, I was put aside to the far corner of the restaurant. Not cozy at all , because the view I had was a wall. The atmosphere of the restaurant seemed good although I could not enjoy it, considering the place where I was put. i ordered a glass of wine, a starter and main course and sparkling water. The appetizer (pork satay) was barely there when the main course-the pad thai-was already there. I had that sent back because the starter was just there . The pad thai came back after all. Warm wasn't it , and the noodles stuck to hard together and tasted slightly burnt. it also seemed to have just been thrown on the plate. there was no inspiration or soul in it at all.  I have certainly eaten much better pad thai. Out at 40 minutes and $90 lighter. Overrated as far as I'm concerned.... downfall by its own success. It would be better not to receive such a large crowd at the expense of quality, but to keep it more limited and to treat the customers who are there with value.\"",
            "First place we ate on a trip to Toronto and we were so pleased! The vibe is so unique, like an underground restaurant! We were lucky to come at a time that it wasn\\u2019t crowded so we sat right away. We enjoyed a pot of tea that was served promptly. We had the spring rolls that came out in like 30 seconds! They were perfectly crispy and fresh! The sauce was a perfect match for them too. I am a big pad Thai fan so when in Canada, that\\u2019s what I got and I was so happy with my choice! The portion was great, not too much and not too little. The beef was perfectly cooked, the noodles were light and tasted fresh. The ingredients came together perfectly! I got medium spicy because i am usually disappointed that it\\u2019s not spicy enough. This was a perfect level of heat for me, made my nose run but it was so good! My mom got the PAD PHET CHICKEN and enjoyed it. She was unsure what to get and took a shot in the dark but was happy with her choice. She felt it was a little on the spicy side, although she was told it wouldn\\u2019t be but she still liked it. We are so pleased that our hotel recommended this location! We may even be back before we head back to the US.\"",
            "I am absolutely 100% sure that this restaurant was a gringy  hippie hangout in the late 60's. The vibe is definitely not Asian .Other than a few dodgy looking Buddhas  the d\\u00E9cor remains me of a slightly seedy bar in a Steve McQueen movie. The d\\u00E9cor is warm,, low rent andt nicely funky. The fact that the restaurant is below grade and consists of two interconnecting rooms adds to the atmosphere.\\n\\nIn any event , the food was very good. My Pad Thai was well prepared with nice flavors, and was  a very gorgeous portion to boot. An ice cold beer went perfectly with the food.\\n\\nPrice was reasonable and service excellent.\\n\\nI would go back.\"",

            "Our realtor brought us here.  He highly recommended this place as he had been to Norther Thailand.  A busy Thai place in downtown Toronto.  There was a long lineup before the door was opened.  Had Gaeng Massaman.  Full of Thai spices, very rich but wasn't too spicy.  The curry went well with the rice.  We did enjoy the lunch here.\"",
            "I stopped by PAI for lunch before heading to the CN Tower for a tour.  As soon as I walked down the stairs to enter, I could tell this place had a special feel.  The walls were covered with memorabilia in a way that really enhanced the vibe and reminded me of a local place where I live.  I was seated right away and served my cold drink very quickly.  I ordered a Spicy Shrimp Pad Thai and the portion was huge!  The lime added freshness and the peanuts added a great crunchy element.  Normally I get 2-4 shrimp back home when I order Thai, but I got 6 big shrimp which really enhanced the meal.  I was able to relax and enjoy my meal without feeling rushed.  Thank you PAI for a 5 star Thai lunch experience!\"",
            "Very authentic northern Thai cuisine. The main attraction for this place and probably worth the 45-minute wait was the food.  However, the service at this restaurant was sub-par. First, the cocktail that I ordered was \\u201Clost\\u201D (server\\u2019s words) which was why it took another half an hour to get my drink. Then, another server dropped a whole tray filled with drinks and food close to our table. I understand accidents happen but nobody even bothered to check if I was hit by the broken glass or bothers to offer a napkin or paper towel when the drinks spilled over. Considering this place was credited with a Michelin-mention (not rating), I wish the managers or owners would strive to offer better service to match their food.\"",
            "Tough to get in and rightfully so. Plan ahead, either get reservations or expect to wait an hour. True northern Thai food. Sausage is perfect and a must have starter. Family style and sharing a good approach, large portions. Pad Gra Prow with fried pork very good. Singha on draft.\"",
            "The best Thai food we have had outside of Thailand.  We arrived right before opening time and were seated right away, but there was a line by the time we left.  Medium spice is perfectly comfortable and tasty.  Loved the green papaya salad and the pad gra prow.  Get it with the crispy pork!  Service was perfect.  Definitely highlight of the trip!\"",
            "Having eaten often to Thailand, I find the food here a little adjusted for Canadian tastes. However, food was good. My group of 3 loved the Satay and pad Thai, however I personally found the green curry to be lacking in spiciness (we ordered medium), lemongrass and lime leaf. Maybe adjusted for a Canadian palate? \\n\\nService was a bit haphazard and impersonal. We were asked to leave as soon we\\u2019d been there 90 minutes. Why??? No matter how busy a restaurant is, I find that rude and inhospitable.\"",
            "I love Thai food and always up for checking out new places during my travels. This restaurant was not only close to the hotel but also highly reviewed. When I walked over to the restaurant for dinner and saw the wait of people outside I knew it was good. Fortunately, they have some unique spaces for people to sit side by side and a few for single diners so I didnt have to wait. Very unique menu of traditional and more creative\\u002Finnovative Thai dishes. I went more traditional with the chicken satay and the green curry. Note that the swerver said the hear level on the curry was fairly mild but it was quite spicy. The restaurant was packed and seems to be a popular destination. Not surprised since the servers were very friendly and the food was delicious. \"",
            "I have been to the Yonge St. location a couple of times now and it never fails to impress. I first came here for a dinner date with my boyfriend before we went to see a movie and the experience made the evening even more memorable. The restaurant is decorated in a way that makes you feel like you are enjoying your delicious Thai dish on a warm summer night. I think knowing the story of Chef Nuit (shared by the front table) adds to the authenticity and detail of the meal. Given that Thai is one of my favourite cuisines, the few dishes I had have already set a new standard. There is a great variety of dishes to choose from, as well as many options for those with food restrictions. In addition, the staff is always friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend Pai to everyone and I will continue returning!\"",

We ordered a variety of items including spring rolls, red and green curries, pad Thai and khao soi.  Everything was amazing and packaged well.  \\n\\nOnly improvement I would recommend is that the portions were smaller than other Thai places but the quality and flavours made up for it.\"",
            "Pai Northern Thai Kitchen is popular....really popular. Reservations go quickly and the wait for a walk-in can be up to an hour, but have patience because it's worth every minute of the wait. The restaurant has a very eclectic decor, great music in the background and very friendly staff. The kitchen creates excellent dishes and drinks - a wide variety of Thai specialties served loaded with spices and aromas and very generous portions.  This is one restaurant which should not be missed when in Toronto and you'll be coming back but get in line behind the locals because they love it too.\"",
            "Just had a fine meal at Pai today. It's a cozy basement restaurant with a bit of a hippy vibe. We arrived at 1:30 on a Thursday afternoon and were immediately seated. Service was attentive and very good.\\n\\nWe shared an order of Grabong (squash fritters) and a bowl of Khao Soi with chicken. The fritters made for a great snack and were none too greasy. The Khao Soi was very rich and creamy, a fair bit more so than the brothier versions we have enjoyed in Northern Thailand. We also had a Thai tea which was quite sweet. Pai also has a daily $5 drink special (today's was 1oz of Jameison Scotch) which is good value.\\n\\nOverall, Pai is a really good stop in Toronto for Northern Thai cuisine. FYI, the actual town of Pai in Northern Thailand is overrun with tourists and best to be avoided if you're looking for an authentic Thai experience.\"",
            "While staying at an AirBnB in downtown Toronto over the weekend, we ordered take our from PAI and it was all delicious.

I started with a delicious Lentil Soup while the gentlemen shared the Fatoush with toasted pita bread.  We shared the Maza Platter which had the house famous hummus, baba shanouje and falafel.  Next came the Kubbeh which was a golden brown shell of cracked wheat filled with minced beef, onion, pinenuts and almmond.  Our taste buds were totally enlivened and the same time, we ate healthily.

The area was not busy this time of night, but this place was packed.  The party room was rocking with a birthday party and the outside dining room was quite full as well, but we got a table quickly.  I don't know middle eastern food so the menu was alien to me.  We decided to try their Dinner for Two.  We had two plates of humus with pita bread, salad, pickled veggies, and grilled chicken.  They were all very good.  My boggest surprise was a side dish of stewed tomatoes slices.  I have never been a big fan of tomatoes, but this was most delicious.

But the grilled (\\\"barbecued\\\") shrimp were astonishingly good, seemingly bathed in spices before grilling, so I didn't miss the red meat at all.

The braised lamb shanks are very good.  Other choices are roast beef, chicken, lamb chops... The fruits and salad section is great ( including eggplant pur\\u00E9e, beets, chick peas) with lots of dressings and dip like hummus, Labni.  Desserts offered includes baklava ( our favourite though it might be too sweet and oily for some), various custards and cakes.  \\n\\nThe belly-dancing was great, with not too few little girls flocking to dance together.

That same system pings you when everything's ready.  I swung by in a few minutes, grabbed my baggies, no problems.\\n\\nOK so the hummus is just brilliant as usual.  Loads of WW pita for dipping.  So tasty.  Labni is in the bag too and this stuff is great on the kefta (lamb\\u002Fbeef) and tawuk (chicken) kebabs.  We always love the mujaddaru lentil rice - a meal in itself, just about.  \\n\\nThe one miss for me is that no desserts are on offer at the moment; I could not get the muhalbiya.\\n\\nAbout the wine:   who would have thought you'd order a bottle with your takeaway two months ago.  But this is a stellar idea.  Some restos have their suppliers drop off the usual offerings - familiar Aussie syrahs, inexpensive Italian rossos, VQA whites - plus a few surprises.  These are things you can't get in the general listings and worth exploring.  Last night the French pinot noir was an error and the recco instead was a 2017 Mark West.  Solid choice from a winery that does only pinot.  And while I usually 'whine' about markups, not this time.  Take-out wine means putting it in a brown paper bag.  No glassware to bring, take away, wash, dry, re-set; no sommelier time to offer lists, consider pairings, and make remarks; no opening, decanting, pouring and re-pouring... all this means the resto can drop some of that mark-up and offer choice to diners.

I had the lamb and my husband the chicken. Both were nice but not really special. We shared a dessert which was really tasty and not too sweet. Overall a nice meal but I wasn't wowed by the main - would go back but maybe just order a selection of the mezze dishes as a main too. \"",

            "I had heard about these coffee shops throughout Toronto so we decided to visit the Mill St location before going to the Blue Jays Game on Canada's 150 Birthday.     While earning a university degree in French Literature, Diana Olsen, President and Founder of Balzac\\u2019s, discovered a kindred spirit in Monsieur Balzac and his genuine passion for coffee. Upon graduating, she immersed herself in authentic French culture, spending a year and a half in France. Passing many enchanting afternoons in the Grand caf\\u00E9s of Paris, Ms. Olsen was inspired to bring this sophisticated celebration of coffee and social tradition back home to Canada.\\nSan Francisco was her next stop in 1993, to learn the craft of coffee roasting and bean selection at the West Coast Specialty Coffee Training Institute. In 1996, the first Balzac\\u2019s caf\\u00E9 was opened in Stratford, Ontario. Today, Diana oversees all aspects of caf\\u00E9 operations and coffee roasting from the Balzac\\u2019s Roastery in Ancaster, Ontario.\\nVisiting this location is an experience.  Not only is the coffee amazing, but the decor is exceptional.  There is an upstairs area to relax and visit or go onto the internet while enjoying a delicious coffee and an mouth watering dessert.  There is also a patio area if you are a people watcher on a summer's day.  A definite must see~~~\"",

            "While visiting the Distillery Historic District for the second time, I was really looking forward to coming back to this gem of a coffee shop. Since my last visit, which was several years ago, a number of cosmetic changes have taken place, some of which, in my opinion, took away a bit of the old school charm of the space. For example, the large vintage coffee machines were replaced with smaller, more modern ones. Assuming this was to maximize on space or for easier maintenance. However, again, it took away some of that old school charm that made me fall in love with this place to begin with. In addition, at the time I visited, they had run out of coffee mugs, so my latte was served in a plastic tumbler - not very sexy. My server was apologetic, but my overall experience was not what I had hoped it would be. The coffee was still good though. \"",
            "We went twice, it was so good.  You could indulge in the espresso based coffee ( we did) but actually preferred the brewed coffee.  Excellent, as was the almond croissant ( heated).\\nHighly recommend.\\nNote this is a busy spot!\"",

Unfortunately I was in a bit of a hurry but you just sit and enjoy the coffee looking at the amazing artworks.\"",

Sit down and enjoy.  Trust me you love it so much you'll want to have a second round.  Pricy but worth it.  \\n\\nOne of the best things about Balzac's is it was started by a young Canadian couple who also have a cafe at Up Express, located in Union Station.  \"",

They have indoor and outdoor seating. The indoor seating is huge and extends on a second level as well. \\n\\nMy friend and I were there as tourists, but we saw a lot of people studying since it's next to Georges Brown College and I believe that it is a perfect spot to study since the music isn't too loud and the seating area is huge.\\n\\nAs for the coffee, it was absolutely delicious. I ordered an iced coffee with soy milk and a vanilla pump.

If you know nothing about chocolate, ask a staff member to give you the low down.  Customers range from pretentious chocolate experts to tourists just trying to get a souvenir.  Try the hot chocolate.  It's like melted home made chocolate in a cup and it's soooooooo good.  With milk, don't be a wimp.\"",

Very good espresso and you should try mayan hot chocolate which would give you a jolt - no espresso could compare. In the summer they sell ice cream and gelato. Not much seating, little patio. So most just grab and go. \"",

It is wonderful dark rich flavor, the only other location I have found it is on the island of Bonaire.  There was a short line, but worth waiting every second.  Wide variety of flavors including sweet cream, coconut, and CHOCOLATE.  They accept credit cards and US dollars.  Yes, it is so wonderful that I had just finished an amazing lunch at Cluny and still made room for the gelato.  I did not taste the chocolate candies.\"",
            "You can see chocolate-making in the works behind the glass windows.  Lineups are out the door on the weekends.  Their hot chocolate is less sweet and richer than the icky powdered stuff from the supermarket.  The Mayan version has a nice kick of spice to it and is equally excellent in a latte.\""

I stayed in the restaurant to eat and my meal was delivered shortly afterward. I grabbed a lot of the different salsas to try with my tacos and the handful of nacho chips they give you and they were all great. The tacos themselves were just average in my opinion. For me, I judge the taco on the meat itself and not the toppings and both were not overly flavourful to be honest.

Wilbur is a one off restaurant that does everything Chipolte does but better \\u2014 by a large margin. It\\u2019s easy on the wallet ($8-10 for a burrito and chips) and offer a menu or alcoholic beverages if you want to have a beer with your food. \\n\\nEverything, meat and vegetables, is fresh and cooked on the grill, their guacamole is probably the best I\\u2019ve ever had, they have what appears to be 50-100 different hot sauce options and their salsa bar offers a wide range of flavours. \\n\\nBuyer be warned though, because this place is so good there\\u2019s usually a pretty lengthy line that breaches the front doors on the regular. Be prepared to wait by the wait is worth it. \"",
            "Reviewing this as Mexican a spot in Toronto..because while pretty good, it doesn't compare to what you would get in AZ or NM.

The main thing is the food, which is really good. The tacos were very good and my son loved the burrito he had. Plus, they had some of the best guac I've ever had. Would definitely go back!\"",
            "My first time in Wilbur was a very pleasant experience. They have burritos, soft tacos, burrito bowls and more. What impressed me most however is their options for sauces. They have a wide selection of sauces that will blow your mind. Wilbur in a nutshell is a better, tastier version of chipotle. \"",
            "Good value for tacos, all under $5 each with vegetarian options such as avocado or mushrooms at $4. The tacos were decent with a side of tortilla chips. Massive selections of hot sauces to choose from. Great attentive services and lovely atmosphere!\"",

            "Finding good Mexican food has always been challenging in Toronto. You've got to know where the few good ones are. Taco places have been popping up in the last few years but few have matched or eclipsed the few handful authentic and awesome spots of Tacos El Asador or El Trompo. As a huge fan of Mexican food, let me tell you that this is one of my go-to places for tacos. Let me list the reasons in order of precedence:\\n1) the Bulgogi Taco is fantastic. I'm usually not a fan of cross-pollination of cuisines but this little guy is an exception.\\n2) the homemade hot sauces and pico gallo, especially the habanero\\u002Fpineapple one are almost like they read my diary and made my dreams reality\\n3) for a 'west end' downtown joint, the prices are VERY VERY GOOD. I generally dislike eating out in the west end of downtown Toronto due to the obscene prices for what you get. This place is one of the few reasonable priced places in the otherwise trendy area.\\n4) The Baja Fish Taco is one of the best in the city. I've looked all around, so trust me, this is the one you want.\\n5) This is the only place I know where the fahitas come with the sizzling platter ... with the cheese in there. Crispy cheese for the omg-win!\\n6) The Mexican Streetcorn is yummy and beautiful\\n7) the line-up isn't as bad as you think, people come in to eat and leave. This place is about eating, not hanging out. It is very rare that we cannot find a table immediately upon ordering at the cashier.\\n\\nMy one tip: if you love guac, just order a cup of guac on the side. The little ramekin of guac you get with the fahitas is a bit small but any other place would charge you extra anyways for a tiny little ramekin whereas a cup of guac is a good sized cup for dipping and spreading purposes.\\n\\nI kinda go there at least once every 2 weeks. As a huge foodie, that means I really love this place.\"",
            "Very cool casual place on King West. The burritos are amazing and they have a ridiculous number of hot sauces to try! Price for the areas is very reasonable.\"",
            "This place is great! Has great vibes when it is open, and awesome food. Highly recommend the Avocado and Fish Tacos! Great place to grab a quick bite. \"",
            "Came in for a quick bite to eat heard some hype about this place and believe the hype. Some of the best Mexican food I've had. The service was quick and it was the best burrito I've have in recent memory. Would recommend it to everyone \"",
            "My husband and I were in Toronto for the weekend and stopped in for a bite. Liked the menu was simple. Order upon entering and food brought to your table. Margaritas on tap (yes!) are really good as is their chips and guac. Fantastic tortilla chips. We both ordered tacos - 2 steak for him and al pastor and chicken for me. Lots of flavor. The vibe is great in this place. We wanted to go back again but ran out of time. \"",
            "Love this place.  Went back twice in one week - both lunchtimes.  Only had tacos each time, they are small but reasonably priced and absolutely delicious.  Sweetcorn also great. Wish I had room to try other things like burritos, enchilladas etc.  Watermelon juice is outstanding and cheap. If I lived nearby, they'd make a mint out of me - I'd be here every lunchtime.  Sauces are great - particularly the green one with coriander (cilantro).  Love the line-up of chilli sauces too.  Mmmm, making me salivate just thinking about it all.  Great service too.\"",

            "My go to quick food option in King West. Lines can be long in peak time, but worth it if you have the time. Great tacos and burrito bowls with a nice appropriate beer selection. The salsa options are great for the chips that come along side the food. On top of the great food, the vibe gives it 5 stars.\"",
            "I visited this place on a weekday evening. They don\\u2019t have any table reservations and it's the first come basis. You place your order on the counter and then go and find yourself a table. The food is delivered at the table. There is a common area where water & cutlery is available for self service.\\n\\nThe place stands out from the other Mexican places because of their Salsa counter. They have 7 different kinds of Salsas which are free with your meal. Try some of the spicy salsas at your own risk. Their Ghost Salsa is extremely spicy. Now, let\\u2019s talk about food. I tried their Veggie Burrito, Mushroom Tacos & Grilled Avocado Taco. The portion sizes were good and value for money. They serve complimentary tortilla chips with every entree. Burritos had a quinoa filling but you can upgrade to rice for 1 dollar. Tacos were really good with a nice blend of sauces. For my taste buds, burrito felt a little dry though. Overall, a nice place to try some Mexican options.\"",

There are no blended margaritas or food that people traditionally expect so look at the menu ahead of time and try some new items.

Behind the bar, they have an extensive collection of Tequila and Mezcal which is amazingly presented on the wall all the way up almost to the ceiling of the building.

Fresh guacamole was prepared in front of you, so delicious!\\nEverything is fresh and tasty. It's a little more pricey than expected, but the experience was well worth it. Just not comfortable with the stools, without the back rest.\"",

Michelle seated us and was so friendly and gave excellent menu advice.  I didn\\u2019t catch our waitress\\u2019s name, but she was very good too.  We loved the street corn appetizer, but it is not a large portion.  It came in 2 shot glasses and was a little challenging to eat without spilling.  My fish tacos were good, but the birria tacos my companions ordered looked even better.  They have a good drinks menu for cocktails and beer. Wine choices were just ok, so I went with beer.\"",

Sun umbrellas would be a great addition.  Terrific fish tacos with nice, creamy slaw. The traditional margarita was perfection. The service was friendly and efficient. Terrific Mexican music made for a great vibe. Gem of a place in The Distillery !  Hope to return soon.\"",

Will definitely go back.\"",

Tacos were excellent - warm and the fillings were so flavorful! Will definitely come back. The churros were also a hit. The service personnel seemed conscientious of COVID protocols and safety measures.\"",
            "We came here on a recommendation of a friend and we were not disappointed. The vibe is so cool. The patio is absolutely beautiful with a large fire pit , lively music and string lights. The service was great, very fast and friendly. The food was INCREDIBLE.  We had guacamole and chips for an appy which was great, we sampled 3 types of tacos and all 3 were the best tacos I have ever eaten. I would highly recommend the beef bacon stew taco or the fish taco. Both are to die for. Dessert was also phenomenal. Churros served with 3 different sauces. The drink menu was great as well. This restaurant goes in my top 5 places I have eaten at anywhere in the world. Definitely worth a visit, or two.\"",

Our two couples stopped in, no reservation, on a chilly Thursday night in February. Our 2.5 tapas plates at Madrina were not filling enough. We got a table in less than twenty minutes, and the place was fairly crowded.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I shared a nicely strong margarita and plate of tacos. We also got chips and tableside guacamole to share with our friends. The guacamole process was disappointing. I've seen the full mixing done well, this was just stirring. Our tacos were tasty, though!\\n\\nThe ambience was the real draw and we all were now full and ready to head home. The total was US$60, so not cheap.\"",

It was sooooo good.\\nThe goodness began with the person taking our order who was a lovely gentleman, polite, accommodating, and friendly.  \\nOur order was brought out promptly with enough forks for all and we dug in.  \\nI cannot recommend it highly enough.  I liked it enough that I'm going to drag the husband down there so he can experience it too. Nom nom nom.\\nThe chips\\u002Ffries were perfectly cooked.  There was enough gravy (in the kid's opinion) and not quite enough gravy (in my opinion).  Keep in mind I like a lot of gravy - so there was probably the amount a normal person would like.  It was covered in big cheese curds.  Oh momma. So good.\\nThe beaver tail still has me drooling hours later.  The pastry was perfectly crispy, and made the nutella slightly melty. The reeses on top provided a perfect crunch topping.  \\nIf you're debating whether to go - it's important that you go.  Quit debating and go nosh on all the goodness.\"",

            "My family and I stopped here while walking back from the boat cruise. We each ordered a gelato and split a cinnamon and sugar beaver tail. The gelato was incredibly flavorful. If you order two flavors, they will accommodate and present them side by side in the bowl instead of on top of one another. They even asked if we wanted the beaver tail cut into three pieces since we were sharing. This was a delightful experience and highly recommended. \"",

I highly recommend you treat yourselves to a unique dessert you probably won\\u2019t find back home.\"",
            "My husband walked over to grab these for dessert while I hung out at the hotel. When he brought these in, I was shocked at how large they were...and I enjoyed every bite!!

            "Our children absolutely loved Beavertails and desperately want them to set up cafes in England! We decided to visit because it is renowned as a local specialty. We were not disappointed! This was one of my children\\u2019s highlights during our trip to Toronto!\"",
            "If you are by the harbourfront this is a great spot to stop by for some one of a kind authentic Canadian dessert. This is as Canadian as it gets second to our timmy's and baseball. A lot of toppings to choose from but if you like hazelnut spread then that is hands down the best. Also, the hot chocolate with marshmallow is amazing.\"",

Nutella and banana is good or the cinnamon apple with maple syrup. \\nThe place is small and not many sitting inside. But on the nice day, you can always sit outside. We had the toppings above and its yummy! My son is not crazy with the strawberry shake as it tasted chemically flavour and I agreed as I sipped it. \\nOne tip: make sure you have wet wipes or liquid hand wash otherwise you have to wait in line for the bathroom to wash your sticky hands.

            "Whenever we are in this area, we always stop at this location to have a mix of beaver tails (I used to have as a child in several European locations as done in markets or when the circus was in town).  Clearly this is now taken to a new level and not wanting to have my face covered in chocolate as it happened after having a beaver at Niagara, no one telling me of the chocolate on my face, we decided to get a pack of 6 for 24 dollars, I think.  The downside is they are not as great 24 hours later, but there is so much sugar I can have nowadays.  The staff was nice and friendly, the crowd increased in no time after arriving here, proof this place can still get very busy.\""

Had to tell the server twice to remind !!! Ordered Pad See w Chicken and TY soup. Soup not that hot, main dish not warm at all. Must have been standing at the kitchen table for a long  time, to be served. For this I will give poor review. The food was tasty and enjoyed. The price is moderate, servings enough. May try again in future to try other dishes, but will book on line first!\"",
            "I stopped by PAI for lunch before heading to the CN Tower for a tour.  As soon as I walked down the stairs to enter, I could tell this place had a special feel.  The walls were covered with memorabilia in a way that really enhanced the vibe and reminded me of a local place where I live.  I was seated right away and served my cold drink very quickly.  I ordered a Spicy Shrimp Pad Thai and the portion was huge!  The lime added freshness and the peanuts added a great crunchy element.  Normally I get 2-4 shrimp back home when I order Thai, but I got 6 big shrimp which really enhanced the meal.  I was able to relax and enjoy my meal without feeling rushed.  Thank you PAI for a 5 star Thai lunch experience!\"",
            "Went here for dinner and really loved this place. We had the Khao Soi & Hanglay curry both of which were delicious. Service was friendly and quick & prices are moderate too so overall a great visit - really recommend this place!\"",
            "We were able to get a table during the window outside of reservations.  11:45 to 2pm I believe on most not all days.  We had the gluten free Shrimp Chips with Tamarind sauce.  Great.  The mango slaw salad. Awesome, generous portion.  I had the Green curry which was also fantastic.  My wife had a rice based dish with ground pork, crispy fried pork peppers and topped with an egg.  If we had a complaint about anything it would be the egg was a bit too undercooked.   Our server was attentive and I\\u2019m sure would have addressed the issue, but we didn\\u2019t bring it up as we were more interested in trying lots of different flavors.  We\\u2019ve had lots of eggs.  Didn\\u2019t want to bother about it.  We split an order of mango sticky rice.  Excellent meal and a great value for fine Thai in a casual setting.\"",
            "Recently ate at this restaurant with my niece who was very familiar with the place. Had the Chiang Mai beef noodle soup - honestly the best soup I've had in a very long time. The flavors were incredible. Loved the ambiance and by the crowds, obviously a very popular place. Can't wait to go back someday...and will bring the rest of the family.\"",
            "Just had a fine meal at Pai today. It's a cozy basement restaurant with a bit of a hippy vibe. We arrived at 1:30 on a Thursday afternoon and were immediately seated. Service was attentive and very good.\\n\\nWe shared an order of Grabong (squash fritters) and a bowl of Khao Soi with chicken. The fritters made for a great snack and were none too greasy. The Khao Soi was very rich and creamy, a fair bit more so than the brothier versions we have enjoyed in Northern Thailand. We also had a Thai tea which was quite sweet. Pai also has a daily $5 drink special (today's was 1oz of Jameison Scotch) which is good value.\\n\\nOverall, Pai is a really good stop in Toronto for Northern Thai cuisine. FYI, the actual town of Pai in Northern Thailand is overrun with tourists and best to be avoided if you're looking for an authentic Thai experience.\"",

            "No reservations here, walk in only. You may have to wait briefly in a lineup but the food is worth it. Young, hip vibe. Prices are very reasonable and staff are excellent. You have to able to walk  downstairs to get inside. Try the green curry, it comes in a coconut.\"",
            "The overall food and ambiance are average and not much different from any other Thai restaurants in Toronto. The wait time is so long (although they have 90 mins time limit per table) - not sure why it took us more than 45 mins to be seated on a Saturday after 2:30 PM - we saw a lot of empty tables inside too.... [TIP: Reserve a table beforehand]\\n\\nThe taste of the food is not unique and different from any other Thai restaurant. I had ordered Khao Soi, which is a bit saltier, and I had eaten a better version before. Their Panang curry was good.

I ordered a fiery one but was advised to have a medium one - I definitely could have done with a bit more of a kick so should have probably stuck to my guns! Cocktails were good and service great. Really lovely little place!\"",

            "Felt disappointed after eating dinner here recently. We had expected so much more based on reviews we had seen.  The restaurant is pretty loud and the crowded conditions with the tables one on top of the other make for a cafeteria type dining  experience.  Service is excellent, friendly and knowledgeable, however, the food was rather bland and tasteless.  The grabong appetizer tasted of the deep fry, no crispness of the squash remaining.  \"",
            "I love Thai food and always up for checking out new places during my travels. This restaurant was not only close to the hotel but also highly reviewed. When I walked over to the restaurant for dinner and saw the wait of people outside I knew it was good. Fortunately, they have some unique spaces for people to sit side by side and a few for single diners so I didnt have to wait. Very unique menu of traditional and more creative\\u002Finnovative Thai dishes. I went more traditional with the chicken satay and the green curry. Note that the swerver said the hear level on the curry was fairly mild but it was quite spicy. The restaurant was packed and seems to be a popular destination. Not surprised since the servers were very friendly and the food was delicious. \"",
            "I was hesitating between the qualification \\\"poor\\\" and average.I ate here solo February 23th.  It was crowded, I was put aside to the far corner of the restaurant. Not cozy at all , because the view I had was a wall. The atmosphere of the restaurant seemed good although I could not enjoy it, considering the place where I was put. i ordered a glass of wine, a starter and main course and sparkling water. The appetizer (pork satay) was barely there when the main course-the pad thai-was already there. I had that sent back because the starter was just there . The pad thai came back after all. Warm wasn't it , and the noodles stuck to hard together and tasted slightly burnt. it also seemed to have just been thrown on the plate. there was no inspiration or soul in it at all.  I have certainly eaten much better pad thai. Out at 40 minutes and $90 lighter. Overrated as far as I'm concerned.... downfall by its own success. It would be better not to receive such a large crowd at the expense of quality, but to keep it more limited and to treat the customers who are there with value.\"",
            "We love Thai food so we were looking forward to eating at this restaurant. There was somewhat of a long wait so we built up an appetite and ordered a bunch of dishes. While the food was good, it wasn't the best Thai food we've ever had. Also, this restaurant felt a bit more \\\"westernized\\\" compared to the mom and pops restaurants that we frequent. That said, it was a solid meal and all of the dishes were tasty.\"",
            "Wonderful Thai restaurant with such a big menu of variety for all dietary requirements. This place doesn\\u2019t take bookings in advance so you do just have to queue up and wait\\u2026 and they are always mega busy!! We waited for about 30-45 minutes to get a table but I can see why - it\\u2019s amazing and definitely worth the wait!! We enjoyed an incredible Thai feast between us. Unfortunately, they ran out of the mango sticky rice dessert, which is usually my favourite which was surprising given it was only about 8:30pm\\u2026 but overall, the food was brilliant so we didn\\u2019t mind.\"",

            "The meal, atmosphere and service were perfect. We waited around 15 minutes around 4 PM on Saturday, and we enjoyed our beer while waiting to be seated at the bar section and paid at the end. Ninety minutes limit to finish your meal which is more than enough because in 15 minutes you feel complete with all your stuff. They are amazing!! My husband and I shared GRABONG (the least delicious thing on our menu, I wouldn't say I liked it much, but you can try it). Deep-fried chicken bites served with their house-made sweet chilli-garlic sauce are AMAZING! Please listen to your waiter\\u002Fwaiter's suggestion for the chilli level of your food.\"",

            "At first I was skeptical because I'm not crazy about trendy places that overprice and underfeed. But Pai did neither of these things, and it definitely delivered! The flavours were terrific, the atmosphere was very cool, and the service was efficient. This was at the UPTOWN location.\"",
            "I was in Toronto attending the annual TIFF film festival, and dined at this restaurant on my birthday. I wanted a nice meal and a break from all the movies, and the large crowd hanging around out front and the hour-long wait for a table reassured me that this was going to be a tasty meal. I put my name on the list and waited for a text that my table was ready. (The hostess asked if we would be okay sitting at a communal table, so be aware if you're super private and would prefer to dine alone).\\n\\nThe restaurant is in a basement, so it's very dark and intimate inside. It is packed with tables, so you'll run a gauntlet to get to your table. The atmosphere is casual and lively, and it's very loud inside with concrete floors and walls. The decor is casual and fun, with colorful flags adorning the walls and a large bar in the center.\\n\\nSince it was my birthday, we decided to order a bottle of prosecco that was listed on the menu. The friendly server took that order and disappeared, only to return to say they didn't have any bottles of prosecco, and we'd have to order by the glass. Big disappointment.\\n\\nWe placed our order for Thai vegetables as an appetizer and we each got their house specialty: Pad Thai. I chose shrimp, my husband chose beef. Our server typed our orders into his electronic pad and disappeared for the remainder of our meal.\\n\\nThe place was packed and they obviously didn't have enough servers waiting tables, so the service knocks this place down at least one, but probably two, stars. Another thing that really bugged me is that we were charged prices that were higher than what was stated on the menu. I am not sure if this was just the \\\"tourist surprise special\\\" or if they have dynamic pricing during special events downtown, but it rubbed me the wrong way. My prosecco per-glass price was almost three dollars more than listed on the menu, as were our entrees. Not cool.\\n\\nI also was annoyed by the volume of noise in the place. It was SO LOUD with people screaming to have conversations. This would've been a killer place for a romantic evening if they could do something about the noise levels.\\n\\nThe food was really good and made with high quality ingredients, so I can't complain about that at all! In fact, I'll definitely return next time I'm in town for the festival. Note: they won't take reservations during TIFF, so don't bother.

            "I have been to the Yonge St. location a couple of times now and it never fails to impress. I first came here for a dinner date with my boyfriend before we went to see a movie and the experience made the evening even more memorable. The restaurant is decorated in a way that makes you feel like you are enjoying your delicious Thai dish on a warm summer night. I think knowing the story of Chef Nuit (shared by the front table) adds to the authenticity and detail of the meal. Given that Thai is one of my favourite cuisines, the few dishes I had have already set a new standard. There is a great variety of dishes to choose from, as well as many options for those with food restrictions. In addition, the staff is always friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend Pai to everyone and I will continue returning!\"",

Reservations go quickly and the wait for a walk-in can be up to an hour, but have patience because it's worth every minute of the wait.

The kitchen creates excellent dishes and drinks - a wide variety of Thai specialties served loaded with spices and aromas and very generous portions.  This is one restaurant which should not be missed when in Toronto and you'll be coming back but get in line behind the locals because they love it too.\"",

            "Restaurant is located in the middle of downtown and was a short walk from our hotel. Upon arrival you need to check in with the hostess to get added to their wait list. There is a waiting area that they ask you to wait in however it was full upon our arrival. They told us there would be a 30 minute wait. We had arrived as a party of 3 with a 2 year old and a stroller. There was no handicap or stroller access into the restaurant. So we waited to the side and were asked to sit in the waiting area but it was full. As we stood around for 15 min we were asked again to go in the waiting area and this time there was space. As we\\u2019re waiting we borrow the menu to see what to order so we would be ready when our table was ready. After 40 minutes our table was ready. We got seated and a waitress came to take our order. We tell her what we\\u2019d like to eat and half the items we wanted were not available due to a staffing issue she said. I have no problem with the staffing issue but you would think during my 40 minutes of waiting the hostess could have made us aware of items they were out of or crossed off the items off the menu they were out of (about 25% of the menu). Anyways we proceed to order the chicken satay, pad Thai, green curry and the sweet potato fritters. All of the food was delicious and would recommend all the food to everyone. But they need to work on their service to help customers make better decisions when ordering. This would also help speed up the ordering process.\"",

Our front desk person called for us and got us a reservation. We applaud him. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was spot on. The ambience was so peaceful and inviting. The food was the best we've had in Toronto EVER. I got the seafood creole pasta and my husband got the fisherman's plate. So. Good. \\n\\nMike hooked us up with a shot to cap off our night. So. Good!

Jambalaya, Shrimp Creole, Fisherman\\u2019s Plate, Gumbo ya ya, calamari, coconut shrimp and Caesar salads.  What a feast!!  Even homemade beignets! \\nDon\\u2019t hesitate to order takeout until you can have the full experience of dining there when COVID restrictions are lifted. You won\\u2019t be disappointed!\"",
            "We had 2 wonderful dinners in this restaurant and are still flashed. We landed and drove directly there due to the very good ranking. On our first visit we took the Fisherman's plate twice and it was sooo delicious. The Beer and Coconut Shrimps, were amazing, like the calamari and of course the fish, rice and vegetable. We drank beer and took the creme Caramel as dessert. The Service from the owner and the Team is so friendly, that you feel welcome from the first second. On our second visit, only 2 days after we were recognized by the owner and he was very happy to see us again. This time we decided for a good White whine and the fish of the day, which were fantastic. \\uD83D\\uDE0D Also the appetizer scallops were brilliant. The pecan cake with vanilla ice cream was excellent too. We ate so glad, that we visited this restaurant and ate so good.

            "My new favourite restaurant in Toronto - New Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse (Cajun).  Although it's been around for many years, I recently got invited to dinner to celebrate a friend's birthday at this hidden gem in the west end of the city. It's small, nice ambiance, great service and of course amazing food.\"",
            "New Orleans seafood and steakhouse is bar none a fantastic choice. Amazing table service. Beyond delicious food and fantastic staff! The setting is romantic and relaxed and as I mentioned, the food is fantastic. Flavours burst from the dishes offered and the aroma throughout the restaurant is to die for! Food portions are to be commended! The jambalaya for 2 was enough for 3-4 people and by far an amazing choice. Pricing is extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of food!\"",

            "We go there a few nights each year for birthdays and anniversaries.  The fish and beef are always excellent.  The appetizers are great - particularly coconut shrimp and crabcakes. The service is friendly and attentive.  For example, we went with a group of 8 recently and ordered appetizers to share.  Instead of just bring the apps to the table, they made up 8 individuals plates of appetizers and made sure that everyone got a little bit of everything. And the presentation was impressive.  And at the end of the meal, the owner always comes by the table with a little shooter of schnapps to cleanse your palate.\\n\\nHighly recommended - but make a reservation.  The place is small and it always fills up.\"",
            "We have been looking for a restaurant in the GTA that serves New Orleans style of food. We found a little gem that everyone should try and you won't regret it. The restaurant is a family run business and Mike and his family are charming hosts, delightful! Starters included a tasty Caesar Salad, with crispy fresh romaine and freshly shaved Parmigiano Reggiano that was well balanced. The Cajun Calamari were made to perfection and very tender. The Coconut Beer Shrimp was nicely balanced and not too sweet. The Seafood Gumbo was a bit on the thin side but had good flavour. The mains were terrific, three of us had the delicious, melt in your mouth Chilean Sea Bass which was reasonably priced to boot! Our youngest likes steak and he had the blackened strip loin with green peppercorn sauce. The steak was tender and better than the steak he had at Hy's downtown earlier this year. To end the evening we had Beignet's, Bananas Foster, Pecan Pie and Cr\\u00E8me Caramel. Mike provided complimentary after dinner aperitifs which was a surprise and a nice touch. We will be back!\"",
            "This family owned restaurant is one of the best in the city! If you are looking for seafood, it would be the very top! The type of place that could easily be missed because it doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside you have the warmth of the owner and his family, the soothing sounds of light blues and jazz, and some incredible food and environment that convinces you that you are no longer in Toronto.\"",
            "Their business card states, \\\"When the last bite is as good as the first, that's cajun.\\\"  I would beg to slightly differ.  In my experience I would say, \\\"That's New Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse!\\\"  \\nIn my 76 years, I've had the opportunity to travel through more than a few of the countries in the world, while sampling a wide variety of cuisines, and NEVER  have I had better food in a more welcoming, friendly environment.  \\nTables are covered with two red and white cloths and adorned with a fresh rose.\\nNew Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse is the hidden gem of Etobicoke. \\nYou must go for the best dining experience ever, served in a classy, comfortable dining room and  attended to by not one, but many pleasant, well trained staff.  \\nThe owner, Mike, is a special treat all in himself.  He does not miss a table and bestows upon each one an individual attention that seems almost impossible for one man to accomplish in a many-tabled room.  \\nWhen Mike stops at your table, he leaves you with the feeling that you are the only one he has ever had the pleasure to feed.  \\nHis brown eyes have a mischievous twinkle above a ready smile that is inviting and genuinely warm.  His conversation is comfortable and friendly and sneaky.  In our one-on-one time with him he learned I was visiting Ontario from Calgary and my girlfriend and I were celebrating our June birthdays.  Mine had been the 24th and Joanne's was that day.  \\nHave I mentioned the food?  \\nThe FIVE STAR, amazing food!  Beautifully presented and spiced with a deft and knowing hand in true cajun tradition.  My girlfriend had the salmon and I had the lamb chops!  Portions were more than generous and neither of us were able to clean our plates which meant another delicious meal was to be had from our leftovers.\\nI want to say how tender and flavourful the lamb chops were; only the fresh, seared al dente vegetables seriously threatened to show them up.\\nOf course we shared so I got to taste the melt-in-your-mouth, perfectly grilled, salmon that gave me a jolt of pure Pelican envy, wishing for a beak that could hold more than my belly can!   \\nBeing much too full to think of ordering dessert we basked in the last of our wines chosen from a broad cellar selection and chatted.  Even though it was still early in the evening and the dining room was full, we felt no pressure to get up and leave.\\nMike arrived again at our table and said they would like to give us complimentary birthday desserts and to please take our choice from the menu.  \\nSurprised, we both chose the creme caramel which was served on a large dinner plate with a big HAPPY BIRTHDAY written in chocolate and with a lit candle!  Even though we were bursting at the seams we both managed to find room to scrape the last bite of eggy caramel goodness, with a touch of semi-sweet chocolate bark, making it a piece de resistance.\\nNow drowning in our decadent fullness we were served with one more surprise in a small, fluted aperitif.  \\nAt first taste we thought Sambuca, but the taste was too smooth so we asked one of the waiters and found it was a delightful mix of frangelico and white creme de menthe.  Mmmmmm.\\nAnd there you have it!  \\nThe cat is out of the bag! \\nNew Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse is the place to go for your best dining experience ever!\"",
            "For anyone who remembers Sammy's Seafood Creole on Lakeshore Blvd when it was known for amazing ambiance and distinguished food you need to go here. It's ten times better, and Mike the manager and host is extremely friendly and knows how to make people feel at home. My family and I have gone here on a few occasions and we continue to do so even though it's out of our way. Beer battered coconut shrimp, jambalaya, crab cakes are my favourites on the signature menu. Last time I was there I chose the steak of the day and the demiglace and vegetable accompliments were cooked to perfection. For anyone who wants the best of the best in Toronto this is not only a hidden gem, but a place to indulge and enjoy because of the incredible food and beyond exceptional guest service. I work at a 5 star Marriott hotel in Toronto\\n I send guests here on a regular basis, and always receive praise for the reference. Thank you New Orleans for never letting my reference fail. \"",
            "I have driven by this restaurant numerous times.  It is situated in a tiny strip mall in the Scarlett road and east drive area.  I am so glad I decided to check it out.  I first googled it and noticed it was fantastically rated.  We tried to go two times before but one time it was closed due to holiday and the other it was not open yet for dinner.  We finally went there yesterday.  What a treat.  So content.  I ordered the sea bass and my husband the striploin steak and we asked for a topping of shrimp to make it a surf and turf.  It is the best sea bass I have ever had.  Perfectly cooked, seasoned but not too salty.  My grilled veg were perfect and the rice was tasty.  The crab cakes are a must. What a gem of a restaurant.  Pricing is what is in line with a good steakhouse but not too overly priced.  Also the service is impeccable.  We were only 2 ppl and went at opening.  Due to the size of the restaurant, I could see you would need reservations.  Thank you.  We will be back!\"",

All were outstanding. For mains we had a seafood pasta, Fisherman's plate and 2 Chilean sea bass meals. Ditto just outstanding, including the vegetable medely. Not surprising the deserts we ordered were also all great. There is a banana and ice cream desert that two of us had, wonderful and decitant.\\n\\nDining room is not very big, different decoration with a number of older musical instruments, but very tasteful.\\n\\nThis place has earned its high TripAdvisor rating through wonderful service and outstanding food, a must visit restaurant!!!\"",
            "This is a one of a kind restaurant in Toronto with an amazing service and absolutely delicious menu from long list of fresh fish options to juicy steak and a must have jambalaya to share. Everything you are served here is made from scratch in their own kitchen by the working owners Mika (Mike) and Mira, and their wonderful staff. It is hard to add anything new to all of the reviews here. If you haven't yet, call already to make your reservations as this is a must try! Also, they are selling a Creole sauce in various Sobeys locations and other stores, which has become a staple in our own kitchen. Ask them about their suggested recipies and how to add flavours to your own foods.\"",

Nothing was ever too much trouble for him. Derek was attentive, polite and extremely knowledgeable. When we were deciding what to order, Derek explained every type of steak on the menu in thorough detail. The steak tartare, which was prepared at the table by the lovely Derek, was the best steak tartare I\\u2019ve ever tasted. And our main course of Wagyu beef was simply outstanding and cooked to perfection by Deion. The crepes Suzette flamb\\u00E9ed at the table by Derek was also incredible. An extensive wine list too - almost too many to choose from. Celebrating my birthday on this particular evening, I was presented with a beautiful birthday surprise too.

            "A friend of mine wanted to venture outside of her usual Yorkville neighbourhood and so we decided to finally try Black & Blue. We were NOT disappointed. From the moment we arrived the atmosphere was impeccable and welcoming. Our server, Jay was enthusiastic, knowledgeable, and made our entire experience enjoyable. My friend and I even discussed that we hadn't experienced that much attention to hospitality in any restaurant for quite some time. Then came the food. Everything was DELICIOUS! Jay made some excellent recommendations, talked us through each course and was so attentive. Our sommelier was also so helpful helping us choose a wine pairing that was exactly what we were looking for and to our specifications. Everything from the bread, to the steaks and sides was absolutely incredible (a rarity these days!) Make sure to indulge in anything prepared table side. It is done perfectly here and not just a spectacle but an experience. We were so impressed with our server Jay preparing our dessert-crepe suzette table side, complete with a fiery flamb\\u00E9 for a perfect ending to our evening. We even ended up making reservations for the following weekend for friends staying at the nearby Shangri La. This place is definitely worth a try, Jay even offered to give us a tour of the rest of the space! And they have a beautiful patio which would be great for drinks with friends or coworkers. The restaurant itself is gorgeous, modern, lively, and in a great location that's very accessible, but not too busy. We will definitely be returning, make sure you ask for Jay! He made our night. \"",

Extremely helpful and professional. He elevated our dining experience and made helpful menu suggestions. \\n\\nWe went for Prime Rib Sundays primarily. Menu standouts were the French onion soup and lobster carbonara\"",

Our server, Candy made the experience that much better, always having a smile on her face, very kind, knowledgeable and very good at recommendations. She offered some suggestions, that for sure did not disappoint. We ended up ordering the beets, scallops, lobster vongole, wagyu fried rice and the wagyu steak, which was very well cooked and of quality! Very happy with the quality of service and quality of food and drinks.\\n\\nAs soon as we walked in, the whole staff was so welcoming. The vibe of the whole restaurant and ambiance was top notch. Love a place that ticks all these boxes. a 10\\u002F10 for sure! Will for sure be revisiting! \"",
            "We were dining pre-show so very early reservation.  Almost lunch\\u002Fdinner that's how early we arrived (4:30)and our concern was that we would be in an empty restaurant but such is wanting a nice meal before a 7:30 curtain.  While not filled the room still felt warm and welcoming. There were other tables on the go and by the time we got to our mains the room was hopping!\\n\\nAll of the staff are friendly and accommodating.  They will send you a text to confirm your reservation and request business casual\\u002Felegant attire is their dress code.  It is very lenient.  We saw people in everything from athletic wear\\u002Fshorts to dressed for an evening out.  It's all fine but I don't see the point of noting that if they don't enforce it.  I am guilty myself of wanting a great meal even if I wander in underdressed.  That said the atmosphere is elegant.  We could see the bar from our table and it looks amazing. \\n\\n We started with oysters and they were delicious. So fresh and clean with a delicious mignonette.  We then had an array of appetizers - the steak tartare prepared tableside is to die for, so delicious.  The ceasar salad was also amazing.  The carpaccio was great but if you want to go this direction go with the tartare.  All but one of us had some cut of beef or another.  All good.  Cooked as ordered- so perfect!  I shared the chateaubriand and it was everything you could want in chateaubriand!  We ordered an array of sides (although mine came with veg and potato)the lobster mash is INSANE - buttery, lemony and so much lobster-the almost 1\\u002F4 tail piece on top was cooked perfectly.  I point this out because most of the time this type of side has rubbery overcooked lobster.  Not here.  The wagyu fried rice was amazing as were the asparagus and brussel sprouts. The wine list includes our favourite but not commonly available in Ontario wines so that was a bonus.\\n\\nWe have dined at the Vancouver location a few times with mixed experiences.  The Toronto Location, if the quality stays the same, blows Vancouver out of the water.  Such a different experience! I am not an easy 5 star.  I have to note also I didn't look at prices, it wasn't a budget dinner, so this review is totally based on the experience and the food.  We will be back that's for sure!\"",
            "I have been to my fair share of steakhouses all over the world. Only been to Black & Blue once but it was good enough to warrant a review on TA--something I normally only do for tourist attractions overseas.\\n\\nThe food was incredible from start to end. Burrata was a highlight, as was the Kobe Beef ribeye. Portions were relatively generous.\\n\\nService was also great (Patricia was knowledgeable and attentive but not overbearing). Her recommendations were solid. \\n\\nMy one grip was that the sauces were extra. Not that $5 for peppercorn sauce is prohibitive but at this price range I would expect for 1 sauce to have been included in the price of each main.\\n\\nUltimately, all that matters is that our business guests left happy and full. Would go again.\"",
            "Disappointing. The quality of food is very very low, honestly terrible. The Steak is dry and tough, no where near as tender as the cuts should be given the price. I\\u2019ve had better steak for half the price down the street. It\\u2019s also served with no garnishing. The salad was drowned in cheap dressing, similar to what you\\u2019d get at a local bar. My friend tried the Otoro  sushi nigiri and sashimi, said both were very oily and poor quality. I\\u2019ve been to almost every Steakhouse in the city so I was very excited to try Black&Blue after it opened up but unfortunately it was a huge let down. The interior ambiance is nice but the service is subpar. Waitress wasn\\u2019t rude but didn\\u2019t even bother to check on us after serving the food to see how we liked it. I would not recommend this place. The prices are in line with other high-end restaurants in the city but  this one is just not worth it .\"",
            "Black & Blue did not disappoint us tonight. From the moment we walked  in, we were greeted and escorted to our table on time! Gary our waiter greeted us and took care of us all night. He was so helpful, accomadting, polite and always one step away for anything we needed. The food was incredible, starting from the apps, to our main meals , everything tasted amazing. We ordered beets, calamari, a special salad, and array of sushi rolls to start. The freshest sushi I have every eaten! But the main meals were the stars... our beef Wellington served table side was sooo good and cooked to perfection.  The Lobster and steaks were so good, and cooked to perfection . \\nI must say when you see this restaurant you will scream \\\"wow\\\" . It does not disappoint. The ambience, service and food were impeccable and worth every dollar! Thank you Gary and Black & Blue for a memorable night!\"",
            "First time out on the patio as I usually sit by the bar.  Because my son was under 19 (17 yrs old) we could not sit at the bar (keep that in mind), so we sat out at the covered patio.  They brought little stools for our bags so they were not on the ground (we didn't put them in coatcheck).  Elsie was great and gave good suggestions for the sushi and sashimi.  Definitely proper service even though we were just there for a short time, which is what you expect from such a place.\"",
            "The food was amazing! The steaks cooked to perfection. The sushi was made fresh right in the front of the restaurant.

The food is excellent and the service is other worldly.\\n\\nMy server Faiz, was not only on point, but he was extremely helpful, patient, and ensured I had the best experience possible. He didn't upsell me on menu items, and genuinely recommended selections to my preference based off our conversation.\\n\\nNot only did I devour the A5 Waygu steak, but I tried their sushi. Since I was dining solo, I sat at the bar. Nolbert, the sushi chef was amazing. He took the time to explain all of the menu options and the various differences. The King Salmon roll was BALLER.\\n\\nI'd recommend anyone looking for the perfect date night or just a delicious night out check out Black + Blue. \"",
            "The best steak in Toronto.  Jacob and Co. was the leader, this is the new school.  Service is even better.  And if you like sushi (non-beef eaters); the sushi is better than your favourite sushi bar on Bloor.\\n\\nAttended for my birthday, we had an absolute meal befitting of an anniversary celebration.\\n\\nAnd, the service is even better!\"",
            "The bar is definitely a good spot to enjoy a martini.  Several others at the bar were doing social media pics, but I was just there to have a drink and some sushi.  The wagyu sushi was excellent and the casual conversation with the bartender was nice for the experience.  One of the managers came over to see how we were doing, and I told him the same.  Already planning on visiting the bar again soon.\"",
            "I came in the other day and had a lovely dinner with my friends. Patricia was our server and she really went above and beyond. She recommended the sashimi and nigiri platter to start and it did not disappoint! If you have not had the sushi here, you need to! Steaks were amazing. But we will be back because of the service. Thank you Patricia!\"",

We were seated at the bar next to the Sushi chef.\\n\\nWe ordered some sushi, a Tartar bite, and A5 Wagyu(Chef Henry recommended) OMG MUST HAVE IT!! \\nHe made me an upgraded Nigiri Platter and a king salmon roll. fresh cuts of sushi, especially otoro tuna, salmon, and hamachi. My girlfriend opted for the hotate(scallop) and said the hotate had a well-balanced and perfect bite with grilled miso wasabi. \\n\\nOverall, I am always impressed with the flavor profile and quality of all their dishes, and the service is top-notch. I consider it one of the best Sushi and Happy hour deals in town!\""

There were 13 of us. Greeted warmly and the family table had been set aside. From the service, which was friendly, efficient and accommodating, to the food dishes, which were brought out in timely stages which was nice because it allowed you to concentrate on the flavours of each dish separately. The waitress recommended the combination platters because it would give all of us a chance to have two meat kebab choices from chicken, beef, lamb, kafka ( ground beef\\u002Flamb minced, seasoned and formed on a skewer and roasted ). We sampled some of each and they were all lean, nicely flavoured and grilled perfectly. It also included side dishes of hummus dip baba ganoush dish, taboulah salad, fatoosh salad, tomato slices in a sauce, saffron rice, a pickle tray consisting of olives, peppers pickled turnip, and enough pita bread for all. Two of our group ordered separately, one a shrimp dish which came with rice and a very generous helping of 12 large shrimp, and a steak dish. Our waitress, ( I wish I could remember her name )  didn't miss a trick and was obliging even when we asked for separate bills for some of our group.

The food is consistently delicious, my favourites are the kibbe bi syneah (spelling?) and the kofta kabob for main dishes; the fried eggplant and hummous with meat for appetizers.

I started with a delicious Lentil Soup while the gentlemen shared the Fatoush with toasted pita bread.  We shared the Maza Platter which had the house famous hummus, baba shanouje and falafel.  Next came the Kubbeh which was a golden brown shell of cracked wheat filled with minced beef, onion, pinenuts and almmond.  Our taste buds were totally enlivened and the same time, we ate healthily.  Without ordering any liquor, our bill came to less than 30 dollars, cheaper than ordering from fast-food.\"",

I don't know middle eastern food so the menu was alien to me.  We decided to try their Dinner for Two.  We had two plates of humus with pita bread, salad, pickled veggies, and grilled chicken.  They were all very good.  My boggest surprise was a side dish of stewed tomatoes slices.  I have never been a big fan of tomatoes, but this was most delicious.  Make sure you try this because I notice most other tables chose grilled eggplates. The servers were very friendly, and efficient.  We didn't know what to expect going in, but we had a great dinner.\"",
            "Jerusalem's authentic and flavourful Middle-Eastern menu and excellent quality-to-price ratio, make the restaurant a great choice for both lunch and dinner. In particular, the lentil soup, homemade humous,  fattoush salad, and shish kebab, are all top-notch.\"",
            "I am not much of an expert on Middle East cuisine but I know what I like and I liked this place a lot. 5 stars for me would be a meal I can feel in my system for more than a day, talk about for weeks and count the days when I'm able to go back. This place isn't quite there but it flirts with the line between 4 and 5. \\n\\nI had the Siniyeh Bitaheena. The yaheena sauce was tangy and rich with flavor, best eaten with the side of rice once you eat the lamb. The meal will stay with you through the drive back home and will be in bed with you at night, in a good way. I'll definitely try to go back and give their other locations a go while I'm in town. \"",
            "Four of us were here for lunch on a late Sunday afternoon. The restaurant was mostly empty. We ordered the lunch special for two and thought it would suffice for the four for us as two of us had a heavy breakfast in the morning.  The special consists of three skewers of kababs, one each of chicken, lamb and beef. Although the skewers took a while to arrive, we were immediately served two kinds of hummos, taheena sauce, slices of eggplant, a salad, mixed pickles and the most delicious and soft pita bread. It is the best pita I have eaten anywhere. We also ordered a small plate of falafel. Suffice it to say that not only did we eat our fill, but there was enough to take home for dinner in the evening. One of the best mid-eastern restaurants anywhere.  And at a very reasonable price. About $60 to eat our fill - four of us.\"",
            "Toronto-based friends suggested this tourist-free gem that's an 8-minute walk from the Eglinton subway stop, and it appears to have a very loyal local following.  I was avoiding meat this particular Friday, and was fearful there'd be little in a standard Middle East-fare restaurant to fill that gap.  But the grilled (\\\"barbecued\\\") shrimp were astonishingly good, seemingly bathed in spices before grilling, so I didn't miss the red meat at all. This was preceded with some customary Levantine mezze and hummus with a fava-bean foule at the center, all very tasty as well.\\n\\nThe owners are Palestinian, and opened the restaurant four decades ago--the first Levantine restaurant in town, we are told. If you are looking to speak Arabic with the staff, however, look elsewhere: they're of an immigrant generation, to be sure, but our waiter was Sicilian. Mediterranean charm, to be sure!\"",
            "Back in town for a golf holiday and always make it a point to dine at one of our favorite restaurants in Toronto. We love middle eastern food and there is no better place than Jerusalem. The place has been owned by the same family for probably 40+ years and has had the same chef for just about as long!!! That's saying something in the restaurant business. They know how to get it right. That's probably why the place is jam packed most nights. \\nWe arrived about 7:30 and had to wait about 10 minutes for a table to open up. But once seated the service was fast, friendly, attentive and efficient.\\nWe chose the sampler for two priced at $41 Canadian (31 US) and were very pleased and stuffed when we finally finished. There was so much food we couldn't eat it all.\\nThe meal consisted of babaganouche, hummus, assorted pickles and olives, stewed tomatos, taboule salad, felafel and pita to start!!!!! Then came 3 large skewers of chicken and lamb perfectly seasoned and grilled, rice and a large salad.\\nEverything was delectable! Will be back again next year.\"",

            "Jerusalem is the top of its class when wanting delicious Middle Eastern food. The experience you will have at Jerusalem is overwhelming. In essence, you will have a hard time deciding weather to talk about the food, service, or decor of this restaurant when advising someone else to go to this restaurant. The decor makes you feel like you are situated in a dessert just outside of Jerusalem, Israel. The walls are painted like a dessert, and the ceilings are covered with rugs you would find in a dessert tent. The service is incredible. Nothing to complain about as food arrives very fast and waiters\\u002F waitresses are very friendly. Food is in a league of its own. I would recommend delicious falafel balls or chicken shawarma. Chicken skewers with French fries would also be a good option. Each dish comes hot as if it were taken straight from the oven to your table.

There are numerous \\\"regulars\\\" for both dine-in and take-out, always a mix of couples and big family groups, and always a buzz of conversation. And the food is reliably tasty, well-cooked and satisfying whether we enjoy it on the spot or take it home. My personal fave is siniyeh bitahena -- a scrumptious patty of beef and lamb with tahina sauce and pine nuts. It's accompanied by saffron rice and salad. If you don't feel like an entree, the appetizer selection is dee-lish and full of great alternatives from dips (hummous, baba ganoush) to salads (tarator, tabbouleh, mediterranean) to meats and pastries. I've never been disappointed here -- ever -- and have always been proud to share this restaurant with family and friends.\"",

The braised lamb shanks are very good.  Other choices are roast beef, chicken, lamb chops... The fruits and salad section is great ( including eggplant pur\\u00E9e, beets, chick peas) with lots of dressings and dip like hummus, Labni.

            "To begin the interior design was did not disappoint, excellent use of color choices and full of natural light. We visited for lunch. I would like to note that this restaurant was missing the warm welcome that we normally experience in traditional Lebanese restaurants in Lebanon and throughout the Arabian Gulf. Unfortunately there was a lack of attention to detail when our table was prepared and we had to request for it to be re-set. An unclean side dish was delivered to the table and our main courses arrived rather swiftly after we had only JUST begun to enjoy our appetizers (hummus bil lahmeh & halloumi salad). They were not generous with the bread selection. Lack of timing and attentiveness was observed. There could have been more effort to predict when we would be ready to enjoy our main courses or if the ability to predict was not a strong point, they may have simply asked if we were ready. Our main courses: Shish Tawook & Kafta bil banadoura. The French music was lovely, typical Lebanese influence was noted when it came to the art and decor of the restaurant. The smell of garlic infused the restaurant which I found absolutely lovely and had me very excited to enjoy the various dishes. However, there was definitely a sense of something that was lacking as we did not feel the traditional full Lebanese experience. Unfortunately, when brought to the attention of the wait staff regarding the main course that had cooled down while waiting at our table for quite some time, it was taken away to be \\u201Cre-heated\\u201D. The wait staff realized while bringing out the main courses extremely early that it was too soon however delivered them anyways. This was a first experience for us in our dining experiences locally and abroad. At the time when we were enjoying our appetizers, the restaurant only had two tables occupied so there was no excuse for lack of attention and awareness. Another strange point observed, is that it appeared the managers were using customer tables openly to complete work on their respective laptops. The environment lacked true Arabian hospitality, warmth, kindness and friendliness that we normally observe whilst in Lebanon and throughout the Arabian countries. Families are typically well known in the Arab world based on last names in relation to the area where they are from and it is a very common question to ask. It is also something that middle easterners are proud to disclose and discuss with honour. Considering we spend much time there and share the same country of origin as the owner, I was curious to know where exactly the owner was from and his family name. However, when inquired it was taken very negatively by the wait-staff and we felt a sense of confusion from the staff as though they wanted to imply why we would even ask such a question. On another note, we did hear the kitchen staff on various occasions making excessive noise by dropping items so it seemed they were not being very careful to ensure they were creating a proper dining experience for the guests. Dining is all about the experience. We would have loved to witness more passion from the wait staff, less passive aggression when requesting for replenishments (even though we should not have to ask and whichever items are missing from our table should be observed and replenished accordingly) and a more welcoming approach.\"",

We enjoyed some shared appetizers (hummus, labneh and babaganoush) with both regular and gluten-free pita (several GF options are available and cheerfully pointed out by the server).

That same system pings you when everything's ready.  I swung by in a few minutes, grabbed my baggies, no problems.\\n\\nOK so the hummus is just brilliant as usual.  Loads of WW pita for dipping.  So tasty.  Labni is in the bag too and this stuff is great on the kefta (lamb\\u002Fbeef) and tawuk (chicken) kebabs.

But this is a stellar idea.  Some restos have their suppliers drop off the usual offerings - familiar Aussie syrahs, inexpensive Italian rossos, VQA whites - plus a few surprises.  These are things you can't get in the general listings and worth exploring.  Last night the French pinot noir was an error and the recco instead was a 2017 Mark West.  Solid choice from a winery that does only pinot.  And while I usually 'whine' about markups, not this time.  Take-out wine means putting it in a brown paper bag.  No glassware to bring, take away, wash, dry, re-set; no sommelier time to offer lists, consider pairings, and make remarks; no opening, decanting, pouring and re-pouring... all this means the resto can drop some of that mark-up and offer choice to diners.   If this is the future, I'm all for it.\\n\\nExcellent.  Local.  Authentic.  Great service.\\n\\nSee you again - soon.\"",

The Jallab lemonade was an interesting drink with a tangy twist, again a thing that everyone should tryout.

Winterlicious in Toronto, leads to many restaurants offering a 3 course prix fixe. The appetizer sampler of baba ganouj, hummus and tabouleh is good and as advertised. The roasted egg plant main was only so-so. Similarly the kaftan was salty and overcooked. The game-y flavor of the lamb was really in full form. Dessert made with phyllo pastry was good.\"",

The buffet was very attractive:  the food had rich color, a treat for the eyes.  The variety of non-veg and vegetarian food choices was excellent.

            "I was in Toronto at a conference, and really wanted some Indian food, so I asked a friend of mine to recommend a good restaurant. She took me to Aroma. First, it was a problem for me to get to the dining room-- I have mobility issues, and there was no elevator that I could see (there may be one, but if so, it wasn't readily visible), so I climbed up the flight of stairs to get to the second level-- not easy for me. Once I got there, it was a lovely dining room-- airy and spacious. I noticed a few people from India eating there (usually a good sign). It was lunch-time, and the waiter recommended the buffet, so that's what my friend and I had.   \\n\\nThere were many, many choices among the buffet items, including goat, various kinds of chicken dishes, some vegetarian options, appetizers like pakoras, several kinds of rice, several kinds of breads, etc.  I found the food uneven-- while some of the lamb & chicken items were quite tasty (and I was pleased to see a number of kinds of vegetarian dishes), others were not as successful-- the tandoori chicken was a bit dry, and the sauce in the chicken tikka overpowered the flavor of the chicken. We had mango lassi to drink (always wonderful) but the kheer (rice pudding) for dessert was somewhat bland. \\n\\nThe service was also uneven. At first, everyone was attentive, but then, nobody came back to our table for a while, to see if we needed anything; and it even took a while to get someone's attention so we could have the check.  Over all, I was not sorry I went (as I said, some of the buffet items were nicely done), but I wondered if we should have asked to look at the full menu. That said, Aroma was a good, but not great, restaurant, as long as you don't mind climbing stairs!\"",
            "The place was quite empty when we arrived so we got our menus quickly. Our orders were taken quite fast too. We ordered the vegetable pakoras which were very good as apps. We shared a fish curry and a vegetable dish with Indian spices. All was very good with nice spices and not too spicy. Service was excellent. The restaurant was lovely and clean. It was drafty at the windows and near the door even though we were on the 2nd floor.\"",
            "I was with a group of ten people all heading to the theatre after lunch. This restaurant was chosen due to location, price and of course the variety of dishes. I am not an expert in any way on Indian food so my review will only touch base to my overall feelings.\\nThe exterior of the building has a \\\"SIGN\\\" that can not be missed especially when standing outside the theatre. Therefore with such an advertisement behind the doors should be quite the experience. You do need to walk up a flight of steps so for anyone with walking challenges this is not a restaurant for you. Also to go to the washroom there is another flight of steps.\\nThe food is made on the premises since that was what I understood. Each table had white linen tablecloths with napkins to match. There were three areas you can choose food from. One had lettuce, yogurt and other choices. The dessert area had kofta and then a few different flavours of ice cream. The main buffet had a lentil soup, naan bread\\nButter chicken, samosas, tandoori, basmati rice with peas,vindaloo, Bharta (eggplant)\\nThere were other dishes one being goat. All the ones I chose seemed cooked just right with just the correct amount of spice for my taste.\\nI did check their menu online and saw they have eleven different Tandoor Specialties, eight chicken, eight meat curry and thirteen Vegetarian. After talking to the waiter it seemed that choices changed on the buffet which is a good thing for people who choose to eat there on a regular basis. Also it seemed that half the restaurant was filled with people from this country so it must be good!\\nThe waiter was friendly but service for beverages was slow as well as cleaning off the used dishes.. That was due to the place being packed and probably one more helper was needed. We ended up paying at the register $18 for the lunch buffet plus a tip.\\nAn overall consensus was we would definitely return.\\nThe only added idea I might suggest that they type out each dish they have with a short description of what it is, paste on recipe cards and laminate. Do two times for each dish  offered.  Keep in a container (box) in alphabetical order and then take out and put it on the retaining clips they use. Wouldn't this assist the customers greatly plus it assists with any food allergies. Also it would stop the need to print out as you go.\"",
            "There were quite a few choices in the buffet, which includes salad and dessert. For those who are spice-averse, nothing was terribly spicy...for those who like spice, you may find it on the bland side. Staff was not terribly friendly but were not rude. Note: this location is NOT accessibility friendly in any way.\"",
            "I visited this place to try their lunch buffet on a weekday. First of all when we reached, the place was too crowded and we had to wait to get a seat. I would say that waiting there wasn\\u2019t worth at all. First of all, I believe they are overutilizing the place. All the tables and chairs are narrowly placed. Now, coming to the food. In Vegetarian, there were 2 appetizers (Samosa and Mix Veg Pakora), 5 Curries ( Gobi, Matar Paneer, Beans, Dal Makhani, Eggplant), Saffron Rice, Naan and 3 Desserts (Kheer, Gulab Jamun & Ice Creams). Apart from Dal Makhani, nothing stood out for me. Everything tasted average or below than average. The curries lacked flavors and spices. They all tasted very bland. The only thing that is good is you can try multiple options at a decent rate.\"",

            "We have not been here for a while but on a recent Sunday before going to a theatre matinee almost across the street, we decided to retry this place.\\n\\nStill white table cloths, good service and lots of buffet selections even for vegetarians. Items are varied and tasty and you can either eat quickly or take as much time as you want. Having a filling sit-down lunch for under $20 each is getting harder to find in downtown Toronto.\\n\\nAbout the only negative is that it\\u2019s on the second floor with no elevator (that we could see) and the restrooms are one more flight up!!

Both had lots of options to choose from. Our waiter had to check with the kitchen regarding dairy - for dishes that had been marinated with yogurt, fried in butter - which he did and came back a couple of times during the meal with updates.

            "Visiting Toronto for the long weekend we weren\\u2019t sure if we would be able to find a place.  We got to the restaurant a little earlier thankfully as it filled up quickly.  Service was quick and the food arrived quickly as well.  We had butter chicken, aloo ghobi and daal and of course rice and naan.  All were flavorful and tasty.  The meal was very reasonable.  We would go back again.  \"",
            "This restaurant has absolutely amazing Indian food. It is super fresh, flavourful and authentic! The Owner Jyoti, is truly a sweetheart!  Will not go anywhere else!!!\"",
            "Had dinner here a few days ago after last visiting July 2018.  I gave it five starts then but had reservations about the limited menu, the beer choices and the music. None of this has changed.  This time the food was also not as good as last time - my fish pakora was tasty but a big on the soggy side and chicken curry was nice but not excellent.  Sadly we only went as a British colleague said how fantastic it was and we forgot that we'd been before - would definitely have tried somewhere else - Aroma was our initial choice that evening and it's menu certainly looks much better.\"",
            "Thought long and hard as to how to rate this restaurant and decided to give it 5 stars as my food was excellent.  We did think though that, as others have said, the menu is fairly limited - the only appetizer with meat was chicken soup - it would be so easy to offer chicken tikka, which is on the menu as a main.  The restaurant seems to be deliberately missing a trick here.  \\n\\nAnother thing that surprised us was that there was no Indian beer on the menu, well there is but they don't stock it any more.  The beer we had was perfectly fine but why not have some kingfisher or cheetah lagers.\\n\\nAnd then there was the music, better suited to an anonymous lift than a good Indian restaurant.\\n\\nThe food though is undeniably the star of the show, as it should be.  The samosa and the papri were excellent.  the chicken biryani could have done with more meat but was very good and my lamb bhuna was excellent.  The pilau rice was also very good and the naan was perfectly fine.\\n\\nService was very good and at under $100 before tax it was great value for money.\\n\\nWould definitely recommend this place but it will be interesting to try other Indian places in Toronto.\"",
            "This is one of the nicest Indian Restaurant in Toronto. Market street within a row of restaurants. Crisp Chic Clean place. Good food except for the lamb chops which was not to my taste. Pricy the way it should be for Toronto. Cant ask for more. Definitely satisfying if you are in hunt for Indian. Will be back certainly.\"",

The restaurant is nicely laid out, good elbow room and a nice view of the St Lawrence Market area. The aromas are wonderful and help to whet the appetite. \\n\\nWe ordered the paneer, lamb, butter naan, butter chicken, channa and tandoori chicken. Each dish was unique and complimentary in taste. Everyone enjoyed the food and service. The paneer was chunky and nicely seasoned, the meats were flavourful. \\n\\nI tried the local IPA per the drink menu and it was quite nice (not so hoppy) and paired well with the food. When I looked around at the other tables, it looked like everyone was enjoying their meals as well. \\n\\nI\\u2019m glad we found this spot and I look forward to visiting again. \\n\\n(If it helps, there are a few parking spots nearby at Farquhar Lane just a few steps from the restaurant\\u002Fmarket.)\"",

Everything was quite tasty. \\nDidn\\u2019t like the lay out of the restaurant. Ok if you are by the window or by the wall. Not so great in the middle. Not a very cozy restaurant. Service was ok. Not sure if I\\u2019ll go back. \"",
            "Food is very tasty and fresh. The chef came out to greet us which was a nice touch. I had the Lamb Biriyani which was great. Keep in mind that they do not add sugar to many of the dishes or the chai, so if you are used to sweeter foods like in the states, then you can let them know or add it yourself. They do have highchairs if needed. Although not necessary, I would recommend making a reservation if you have a larger group so that they can prepare accordingly\"",

            "Had the best meal at Bindia this past weekend.  I love Indian food but don't have much access to it in my Midwest hometown.  So when we go to Toronto we try different cuisines.  Of all the Indian Restaurants I have been to over the years - this was at the top.  Not only was the food excellent but the atmosphere was nice, and the service was wonderful.  Will definitely stop there again when I am next in Toronto.\"",
            "Great local restaurant near St. Lawrence Market. Food fabulous and great value. Service very pleasant and friendly. \"",
            "The food is consistently excellent and the service warm and welcoming. The menu keeps evolving with new dishes from time to time but their classics remain. There is always a touch of modernity to their cuisine that sets Bindia apart from the traditional Indian restaurant. \\n\\nBy the way, do not expect an all-you-can-eat lunch buffet. They have daily lunch specials and \\u00E0-la-carte. The choices and prices are good and reflect the quality of the food serve (meaning not cheap).\"",

As soon as I opened the door this smell of curry cooks in the air initiated the amazing experience of feeling like in India..\\nGentle playlist was played in the background and just empowered the experience. \\nThe service - well I am a bit speechless, the hospitality was so warm and welcoming, all they tried to do is to make us pleased and this happen naturally because of the people they are..\\nFor appetizers we ordered Vegetable Pakora and Sev puri, for main course we ordered Tandoori platter, Palak Paneer, Dal Makhni, plain rice and Garlic Naan. \\nThe food was balanced, fresh, the spices were sharp but not too much, the dishes were pretty big.. I personally felt like I am in India and eating so comfortable food..\\nMy recommendation - Be there!\"",
            "This is a pretty modern Indian Restaurant with some very tasty dishes. We chose this Restaurant based on TA's reviews and again we were not disappointed. We decided to choose dishes to share among the five of us and as such we picked the Butter Chicken, Lamb Biryani, Malai Kofta, which was fried cheese and vegetable dumpligs, plain rice and regular and garlic Naan. All the dishes were incredibly tasty and fresh and each and everyone of us enjoyed the entire meal. If you are looking for a very good Indian Restaurant then Bindia is an excellent choice.\"",
            "Excellent? Small cosy restaurant. Service was excellent. I was delighted to see Laal Maas on the menu. With some basmati and butter Naan it was really good!\"",
            "Went twice to this Indian restaurant. It was very popular but the staff managed to squeeze us in. Menu was smaller than a normal Indian restaurant but it worked well. Food was cooked really well and presentation was high class. Staff were very friendly and this restaurant is highly recommended.\"",
            "Opposite the market. Fantastic food (I had the Chicken Curry) and excellent service. Good location too.\"",
            "Getting into an Indian restaurant for genuine \\\"desi\\\" dishes is a rarity. You have plenty of Indian restaurants in and around Toronto but most of their hardly stir your taste buds either they do not know how to blend spices with other inputs or their cooking is a big deviation from the traditions. Bindia, however, has been an exception. Lunch on a lean day was not only satisfying but a pleasant reminder the food my mother used to cook on my visits home. Ambience in the restaurant is simple and elegant. Not too crowded, it has a nice seating plan besides provision to enjoy your emails in the open facing the famous Lawrence Market. Grilled fish, butter chicken, channa masala, and naans were all cooked to perfection. Serving was also adequate. It is not only food but the warm and receptive staff made your experience at India memorable. Jyoti, who served us, comes from a village near Jalandhar. She was polite and all smiles as she repeatedly enquired about the quality and quantity of food. It is the personal touch to service that makes it special.\"",
            "A friend of mine recommended this restaurant, and I was not disappointed.  It's located on a side street and was open to the street on the day I was there, a beautiful Fall day.  We were greeted warmly, and the service was warm and hospitable.  There was a good lunch menu, from which my friend ordered the Murgh Curry, which he said was excellent.  I had the lamb biryani, which I have to say was in every way just as wonderful as biryanis I've had in local diners in Chennai.  The mixed pickle and raita were quite good.  I wanted to go back on another day, it was so good, but didn't have the time.  Next trip, though, for sure!\"",
            "Went for dinner here and sat outside on  beautiful Market Street.\\nMenu was reasonable with all the most popular Indian dishes and reasonably priced, about $20 Canadian. Off course rice is additional as is raita, nan etc.each going for about an additional $4 approximately.\\nVentured for lamb vindaloo which was very good, hot \\u002F spicy and tasty. Shame some pieces had bits of fat that spolied the experience a bit. Notwithstanding this, delicious, fresh and tasty. All other members of my party enjoyed their meals as well.\\nHighly recommended, would happily return.\"",
            "Located alongside the St. Lawrence Market with a shaded patio at dinner hour, this restaurant is worth visiting.  The food is well executed and flavourful.  The portion sizes are a tad smaller as compared with some other Indian restaurants, but the pricing is fair and the service is fast\"",
            "If you dislike the noisiness of St Lawrence Market and want to find a good dining place for your lunch, I really recommend this restaurant. We ordered a Tandoori chicken and rice with curry lamb, which were delicious. The server was good and would address our concern about the demand of our taste.  Really enjoyed the meal there.\"",
            "The food here is delicious. I had lamb tikka a spicy veggie dish with cheese in it and the lovely garlic naan that melts in your mouth. The meals may be too spicy if you have a delicate palette but it made my taste buds sing. My mouth is watering as I write this review on an empty stomach. Went there Saturday afternoon with a friend and we were one of only 2 couples there. As the evening progressed they got very busy. The service staff was quite attentive and polite and the location is on Market Street just south of Front. An easy walk from Union  station. For dessert I had a cardamom carrot dish with ice cream and washed the entire meal down with a glass white wine.\"",
            "Dropped in after touring the St. Lawrence Market, and I had a desire for Indian. We shared a veggie pakora and garlic naan. For mains, Dal Makhni, Aaloo Gobhi, and lamb vindaloo. All the food came out quickly, and was very delicious. \"",

There is no need for the reservations on weekdays as only a couple of tables were occupied. \\n\\nLet\\u2019s talk about the ambience and service first. The ambience is pretty amazing and very soothing to the eyes. I was quite surprised to see toilets for diabled people. So, it\\u2019s a totally disabled friendly restaurant. The staff was also very nice & very attentive.\\nNow let\\u2019s talk about the food. We started with Papdi Chaat and Paneer Tikka as appetizers. The Papdi Chaat was amazing. Perfect crunchy papdis with a nice tangy flavor of chaat. Paneer Tikka was also good. In Main course, we ordered their Paneer Tikka Masala and Bhindi Masala with some breads. I felt the portion sizes could have been slightly more. There was nothing amazing about the main course but it was good. Finally finished the meal with some Gajar Halwa. The sweetness was perfect but I felt it can be improved by adding more Khoya or Milk during preparation.\\n\\nOverall, a nice place downtown to have some good Indian food.\"",
            "I came to meet friends for the Jazz on a Friday. The menu has many great choices for us non-meat-eaters.You get a choice of mild, medium or hot. It was very delicious when it came. The room became quite busy and they needed more staff. I hope this spot does well and continues.\"",

The pasta I had kinda tasted like a fancier version of hamburger helper. It was fairly bland and honestly after about 10 bites I was over it. \\n\\nThe hostess was sweet and I kind of wish she had been our server, because the server we ended up getting didn't really seem to know what he was doing. He couldn't tell me anything about their wine (even though there were only 5-7 choices). Not what it went with. Not if it was dry or sweet. Nothing. Then when our meals came out he didn't offer Parmasean or Pepper or ask how the meal was going (I heard other servers doing it at other tables, so I guess we just got a dud?) \\n\\nOverall, I think if you live in the neighbourhood it's a decent restaurant at a decent price, but don't go here expecting the best food in town.

            "Went to Sanremo today on the recommendation of a friend. The experience was fabulous. There is a huge selection of pastries, sandwiches and donuts. As mentioned by a previous person the sandwich was more than enough for 2 people. My wife and I shared 1\\u002F2 and we took the other half home for our son. The fritter is to die for, The coffee was as good as or better than Mickie D's or Timmies. There is a wonderfully stocked deli and gelato to boot..The place was packed but management had a overwhelming number of staff so there was minimal wait time to be served. The staff was very friendly and courteous. They came across as really enjoying working there.\\n\\nWe will be back!!!\"",
            "I\\u2019ll preface this all by saying Sanremo has huge hype attached to it and visiting (especially if you are still trying to take COVID precautions) is intimidating! The place is a maze of twisting lines, requiring you to line up multiple times to secure various items (coffee line, bread line, pastry\\u002Fdonut line, etc.) and it is BUSY. \\n           That said, we opted to visit on a Sunday morning and were already well aware of the crowds we\\u2019d be battling. To avoid the worst of it, we opted to pre-order our donuts for pick up, which does not require you actually entering the busy bakery and then divided and conquered the other parts. My partner in the inside bakery line, and myself waiting at the coffee\\u002Ftake out windows. In the end this was not a casual bakery experience BUT we loved almost everything we ordered and if you know what you are in for before arrival, it\\u2019s worth the effort! \\n\\nWe Had: \\nCheese Pizza (AMAZING) \\nAmericanos x 2 \\n\\u00BD Dozen Donuts (Apple Fritter, Chocolate Coconut, Cinnamon Bun, Chocolate Dip, Sugar Twist, Honey Twist)\"",

Upon moving to Etobicoke the past 2 years I love the big trees, great neighbours, the peacefulness of this area, everything is great except this bakery. Today I was craving such a wonderful Italian dessert that has always been a hassle getting at this bakery, either none available or served stale and lied to again both to myself & my husband. When a client calls in to order an item you expect to get something fresh. Not to only get your husband to drive back home and get two stale desserts... So what's my only choice is to move on and get better service and above all fresh items! Having worked in a bakery when I was an adolescent that was my favourite job I was so proud of the owner my Jewish sweet Meyer was always fair, serving clients with fresh food, and yes selling day old bread & desserts half price. That's being honest and genuine\\uD83D\\uDC4D\\u263A\\uFE0F\\uD83D\\uDE0ANot like some gladiators who just lie to your face over & over. Today wether it's food, technology, apparel it's all the same people don't respect CSR and today people forget that mantra do onto others as you want done to yourself. Be honest and people will not only respect you but will come back. Today was my last day giving this bakery several chances to redeem itself. Greed is all these owners pride themselves on, not good food or good servicio! Shame on you San Remo\"",

I believe the fries are double cooked, making them soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Definitely worth trying.\\n\\nI would have given this restaurant a 5 as my colleague and I had an excellent meal, but unfortunately there was only 1 person on staff serving. She was friendly enough, but run off her feet, so service was slow.\"",

            "The first time we visited Toronto we found the Beer Bistro and the experience stuck with us. The food and the place generally was a lot more informal. We've been a couple of times since, on one occasion bringing my mother in law who was impressed.\\n\\nAfter a few years we decided we would call back. The place is a lot more formal and 'grown up' now. The menu is very much geared towards a refined market and is quite meat centred (not much good for me, but that's just a personal aside).\\n\\nService is decent. The food was good - my husband said the Scotch Egg was exceptional. We took a seat at the bar after the meal and the bar man - sorry I never got his name - was very friendly. The raspberry beer is a delight.\"",

Not a beer drinker so can\\u2019t commen5 on that but can say that the carafe of red that we had was very good.\\nOur server was really friendly and helpful too so all in all an excellent choice.\"",
            "Great place for dinner with good food and wonderful and knowledgeable serving staff. While wines and liquours are available, this place is best for its multitude of beer varieties.

Wish we had gone back to try the mussels, they looked really good.\"",
            "I hesitated to post this review, but was recently reminded of my experience and moved to speak up.  My family and I were in Toronto a little over a year ago and had a lovely, delicious dinner at Beer Bistro.  The quality of the food and service were excellent.  The beer selection and pairings were creative and delicious.  There was just one problem: the Pulled Pork Primanti is just wrong, wrong wrong.  Coming from Pittsburgh, even as a non-native born, I can tell you that what they are offering doesn't credit our city or culture.  \\n\\nA sandwich from Primanti Brothers should be on thick, soft italian bread with meat, slaw and a generous helping of fries.  The meat should be cappicola, roast beef, kielbasa, corned beef (among other).  What they are offering at Beer Bistro is a pulled pork dripping with sauce.  The slaw is de minimus as are the fries.  And the bun, while freshly baked, is just not right.  Also, the hot pepper should be replaced with hot sauce.  \\n\\nConclusion: I'd go back, but I won't order this again.  I suggest the chef take a trip south of the border and do some research!\"",
            "Exploring downtown Toronto, we elected to try this spot for lunch. They have a great selection of beer, especially European varieties and I sampled their Octoberfest selections which were excellent. Our server was friendly and helpful with a good knowledge of the beer available. When the beer I wanted was not available she came up with a good appropriate alternative. Their menu is not extensive, but we found two good choices and enjoyed them both although my wife's pirogi dish was a bit onion heavy and although she likes onions and enjoyed it at first, found the amount of onions was a bit much by the end. \\n\\nThe location of this restaurant is excellent with most of the downtown attractions within easy walking distance. It is also close to the Transit options.\"",
            "As name suggests- a massive beer menu which husband enjoyed. Small food menu but enjoyed steak and pulled pork sandwich. Puddings were tasty with helpful service on beers etc. Very relaxed atmosphere. Lots of families as well as groups of friends meeting up. \"",
            "I am totally enamoured with Beer Bistro, Chef Nathan and Beer Sommelier Ray. Let\\u2019s start with Nathan and the food. There is so much passion in the food. It is made with beer, paired with beer and held high with local passion. Weekends are for whole hog roasts and the rest of the week there are mussels in beer, the worlds best pork sandwich with fries and coleslaw in he homemade beer bun, or have a perfectly cooked steak. The ice creams are so good and change all the time. Have the Stout ice cream and pour beer on top like me! \\nNow there is Ray and his giant smile and massive knowledge.

            "Had the pulled pork primanti, consisting of smoked and shredded pork shoulder, wheat beer and cider vinegar with cheddar and frites. The meat was good but the vinegar just made things too soggy for the bread. Had a Paranoia, a hazy Belgian blonde ale, to drink. It was nice on a summer day. There is a variety of seating.

            "We went to Beer Bistro before a concert at the ACC and had a lovely experience. Two of us had the Saturday night suckling pig special and it was delicious. Their fries really are great, and the homemade ketchup that comes with them is amazing, so much that I needed to ask for another cup of it to make it through the fries.

            "Nice to eat a pound and a half  of mussels plus a couple of pints on the outdoor patio.   Price is reasonable for a downtown location.  Service was good. There are 4 different flavourings available for the mussels.  We tried the lemon and the Belgian White (lemon cream) and the Thai curry (yes - Thai coconut curry, but not very spicy).  I have also had the Puttanesca before (tomato, capers, olives...)   they are all good.  comes with  a mini loaf of bread for dipping.  Also tried the fries.  Very good.   Good service.\"",

This time I enjoyed a chicken curry while my wife had a vegetarian curry, which included basmati rice, tomato\\u002Fcucumber\\u002Fsour cream salad, and a pappadum.

Ivan (aka Santa) will dazzle you with his knowledge and charm and their selection is impressive. Maybe the best restaurant experience I\\u2019ve ever had in Toronto!\"",
            "1 word - AMAZING\\n\\nOVERALL:\\nThis place needs to be on everyone's bucket-list. The Carbon Bar is a sophisticated and grand environment, which features an upscale yet rustic atmosphere, delivers succulent, melt-in-your-mouth meats, creative and well-rounded appetizers, and an inspired bar menu! We can't wait to return!\\n\\nWe dined as a couple on Saturday, March 31st for dinner. Our 1st time here.\\nWe were a little early for our 7:45 reservation but our table was ready when we arrived and we were seated quickly.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE:\\nBeautiful! This restaurant has sky-high ceilings, rustic brick walls, and is very spacious. Every table was full during our dinner, but we did not feel crowded. The colour scheme of white brick, black, and red adds a nice contemporary vibe. The dim lighting was a nice romantic touch, but the lighter colours in the restaurant like the walls opens the place up enough that it doesn't seem dim at all in there. The restaurant has a large bar on the North side, and an open kitchen that you can see into on the South side. Booth tables fill the main dining area. We were very comfortable, and just loved the atmosphere of the restaurant. \\n\\nSERVICE:\\nGreat service! Our waitress was knowledgeable, attentive, friendly, and enthusiastic! I wish I could remember her name. She was blonde with a great smile.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nHand's down the BEST meat I have ever eaten. \\n\\nAPPETIZERS: We had the K.F.C (Korean Fried Cauliflower) and the Duck Tacos. I never knew Cauliflower had the potential to showcase so many textures in one bite!  When you pop one of those in your mouth, the first thing you get is a crispy, succulent burst from the cauliflower florets. Deeper into the bite, the cauliflower develops into a tender, and juicy mouthful. It is seasoned with a sweet and spicy Korean-style sauce, reminiscent of eating a crispy chicken wing, except it's a piece of cauliflower. And, while the sauce is absolutely delicious, the star of the dish is the vegetable itself. Cooked to absolute perfection. A MUST TRY.\\nThe DUCK TACOS were also fabulous! Served as a pair, a large piece of duck meat is placed on an orange coloured anchiote tortilla -- a tender soft tortilla shell, accompanied by a dollop of creamy sweet pineapple salsa, savory smooth guacamole, and finished off by the refreshing acidity of pickled red onions and a splash of lime juice. These tacos are a symphony in your mouth. The flavors are vibrant. These tacos are the epitome of \\\"finesse\\\".\\n\\nMAIN:\\nTHE PITMASTER PLATTER -- Features tender, melt in your mouth brisket, fall of the bone pork side ribs, and crunchy, moist fried chicken. On the side are dill pickles, crispy fries, and a selection of dipping sauces. The brisket was the star of this platter for us. The bark was savory, salty, and bursting with flavor. Charred to perfected, and buttery to taste. It literally melted in your mouth. This was the best meat I have ever eaten. The pork ribs were delicious! They slid off the bone, were not as fatty as side ribs tend to be, and were seasoned to perfection. The fried chicken was an after thought to us because we were mostly there for the barbecued items. However, it was really yummy! The chicken was moist and tender, and the buttermilk crust was light, although it was thickly coasted. This platter is also a very generous serving. We couldn't finish it all, but The Carbon Bar offers to-go service and we were able to enjoy leftovers the next day! \\n\\nALCOHOL:\\nWe ordered the \\\"Black Mamba Margarita\\\" which was made with charcoal infused tequila, and was black in colour. These were dangerously good! I recommend these!\\nThey also have a Bourbon Cart that they roll to your table, which probably features over 100 bottles of bourbon selections. I can't recall what we ordered, but they had a bourbon sommelier help us choose something from the cart and we really enjoyed his recommendation! \\n\\nDESSERT:\\nSo we were here to celebrate my SO's birthday. We ordered 2 bourbon chocolate ganache skulls.. mini chocolates in the shape of literal skulls, coloured gold. These were a nice treat. They also brought out their DEATH BY CHOCOLATE dessert, complete with a sparkler in celebration! Consisting of a chocolate mousse cake, caramelized white chocolate ice cream, hazelnut crumple, and a crunchy toffee tuile. This thing was decadent! The mousse was not your typical kind..  it was layered on top of a white chocolate and hazelnut ganache which added depth to the chocolate dessert. The mousse cake eaten together with the ice cream and the hazelnut crumble rounds out each bite and really provides depth of flavour to the dessert. A MUST TRY!\"",

            "Went here with adult family members. Drinks are pretty pricey. Food is really good. Servers are friendly. Service was fast. We had the ribs, brisket, and the cheeseburger. All were delicious! Would definitely go again.\"",
            "We have wanted to dine at Carbon Bar for a while now and we were not disappointed!\\nCame here on a Monday night for a Barbecue feast and we got one!\\nThe staff were very friendly on our arrival and we were seated right away. \\nGiven our anticipation to eat here, we already knew what we wanted to order. \\nWe chose the Pit Platter featuring ribs, beef brisket, fried chicken, fries and pickles. The brisket was my favourite, so tender and moist. The fried chicken pieces were boneless and very big in size. \\nWe packaged up the leftovers and squeezed in the Death by Chocolate - so rich but very tasty.\\nEnjoyed our time here, would definitely come back!\"",
            "This was our second visit and we enjoyed everything so much the first time, we ordered the exact same thing again! Raised by Wolves was a complex cocktail that involved bourbon and fire and came garnished with a mint leaf, wedged in place by a cinnamon stick that formed a bridge across the the untroubled \\\"waters\\\" of my glass. Amazing. Don't let the name of the best appetizer ever fool you; KFC (Korean Fried Cauliflower) is a sweet, hot, sticky, crispy dish of heaven on earth. It is so satisfying and savory, its hard to believe this isn't chicken! There were lots of interesting options but we went straight to the pit for the brisket. Tender slices of beef, served with sides of sauce and coleslaw. The couple next to us was having a burger with a slice of brisket and their golden brown fries looked so tasty, we had to order some of our own to keep from staring at theirs. Whatever you do, save room for dessert. The Banofee Pie is a nirvana inducing combination of butter, and some kind of gooey goodness with sliced bruleed bananas on top and bourbon infused whip cream on the side. There are no words to describe it other than heaven on a fork.\\nThe service was as good as the food and the back story is pretty cool. This was the studio where they taped the Electric Circus dance show in the 80s. We were a little confused by the tiny signage and barely there entrance door, which looked more like a dive bar than a dining destination, but once inside, the giant space unfolded to reveal a trendy but laid back hidden gem. Kind of like a Speak Easy, but without the secret knock...\"",
            "I visited here with a small group and had an awesome meal. The decor is very cool and the restaurant is huge... much bigger than it looks from the outside. It would be a great place to host a group or to use as a venue. The food is incredible. Although bbq is meat-centric, on a pescatarian diet, there will still delicious options. Order the ceviche... you won\\u2019t regret it!  \"",
            "Went for a friends birthday with a group of 8 after hearing good things. The atmosphere of the place is nice, cool vibe but a bit noisy it was difficult for us to talk and be able to hear each other. Our drinks took quite a while to be served but understanding as it was a busy Friday night. Ordered the beef brisket as I thought a bbq place would specialize in bbq\\u2019d meats. I took one bite and it was enough for me. Brisket was dry and had no seasoning or taste at all. Server realized my plate was barely touched and didn\\u2019t ask if there was something wrong with the meal. I paid for my meal and left hungry which is not a nice thing to experience when going out to eat. I\\u2019m not the type of person to cause any scene or complain I was just disappointed in the service and regret to say I will not return\"",

All in all a great experience, will visit again soon.\"",

Very friendly staff, bar seemed like a lovely spot but will be back to sit in the big red curvy banquettes soon!\\nUpstairs room was big and nice but not stunning like the space below. The service was awesome and the food was fantastic. We probably ordered way more than we should have but couldn\\u2019t stop nibbling at every new thing. The cauliflower appetizers are to die for, the chillies were mildly seasoned and I could eat a whole plate. We had ribs and chicken at the end but I didn\\u2019t think to take a picture. In short, everything is awesome. Just go and eat here!\"",
            "Been to Carbon Bar a few times now.  The service is excellent.  The staff are very attentive and knowledgeable.

            "I come up to Toronto a few times a year for work and I love this place. Realistically the brisket isn\\u2019t as good as you\\u2019d get in Austin Tx but it\\u2019s still tasty. The food is really good, I love the space, and they got a great drink menu. A vegetarian would struggle, but if your group likes meat... this is the place for you. \"",
            "This place gets an A+ for all of my four criteria for a great night out!! Delicious cocktails and great choices of wine, fantastic service ( Martin was friendly and professional), cool vibe and absolutely delicious food!! You must try the fried cauliflower!! The pit masters platter was delicious and that is from someone who doesn\\u2019t really love red meat! It will be difficult because we found the servings generous, but save room for dessert. Be sure to make reservations this place is popular....for good reason! I loved everything about our experience at this place and can\\u2019t wait to return!\"",
            "The Carbon Bar is a sophisticated restaurant where you can enjoy innovative BBQ cuisine. We opted for the $69 Carbon Bar Experience and I highly recommend it.

Make a reservation if you want an actual table - they are busy!!! \\nThis is a definite go to any night of the week for some share plates of comfort food and a few hand crafted cocktails . Excellent service - food comes out piping hot and your glass is never empty! Great music ... overall a definite 5 star for a casual on-trend Queen East resto-bar! \"",
            "This place is one to go to in Toronto. It is a tad on the expensive side but is worth it.\\nI went with a friend, we started with the Korean cauliflower which was great. Large cauliflower pieces, deep friend with a perfectly crispy coating. I could've gone with a little more sauce but the flavour of the sauce is great so I think thats just a personal thing. \\nWe did wait about 20 minutes for our appetiser so our server gave us blistered shishitos for the wait. This was a nice addition to our meal.\\nFor the main course, I got the burger which was FANTASTIC. I have had many house ground burgers but this place has a great ratio of fat to protien which allowed for a juicy burger. I was impressed by the construction of the burger as a whole. From the bun to the cheese, to the size of the patty it was so great. \\nMy friend got the beans and rice which is a vegetarian meal and it was also delicious. Its wonderful to have a smokehouse that also provides great vegetarian options.\\n\\nI would totally recommend going to this restaurant.\"",
            "Epic barbecue food - up there with the best I\\u2019ve ever eaten. I had the platter for one, and although a little expensive (C$38) I could not believe the quantity of food - I couldn\\u2019t finish it! But it isn\\u2019t just the quantity of food, the quality was amazing too. The mac & cheese was also really good. I really liked the atmosphere, but just bear in mind this is more of a bar \\u002F restaurant rather than an upmarket restaurant (this added to the experience for us).\"",
            "Massive place with a good vibe. Great taste and huge portions. They keep it clean and simple in terms of a brief but fabulous menu. They have a good drinks selection as well. The servers are helpful and non intrusive. Do make a reservation and enjoy this wonderful place!\"",

            "I had only heard good things about this restaurant, so I was excited to go.\\n\\nI went with a group of 6.  Apart from the hostess, the service was unfriendly, forgetful and unprofessional.\\n\\nWe ordered two apps.  One came immediately.  The other came 5 mins after the mains were served.  No one could eat much of it and it was wasted\\n\\nWhen we ordered the apps, no one asked if we wanted drinks.  We had to order drinks after and ask for them.  The waitress did not seem too interested in entertaining questions or giving recommendations.\\n\\nWe ended up having 2 servers as there was a shift change.  The service did not improve at all.\\n\\nWith our dessert, two out of four coffee\\u002Fcapuccino orders were wrong.  The waiter blamed the barista saying that he was new and didn't know what he was doing.The coffee was cold.\\n\\nThe food for the most part was good.  The burger was very good. I swapped regular fries with yuca fries, which were delish.  The cauliflower (the one without all the works) was very good too.  The drinks are stiff.  The cornbread is nothing exceptional at all and was a massive disappointment.\\n\\nThe chocolate skull thing is interesting and is an Insta worthy type of order.  It was neither here nor there with the taste and was no too sweet and slightly fruity.  It definitely did not taste as good as it looked.\\n\\nMy group didn't seem interested in the BBQ.  I wish we had take BBQ platters as I think the experience might have been better.\\n\\nI liked the vibe and the decor. The location is a 5 min walk to from Queen subway.\\n\\nI might try it again on a more regular day and time when hopefully the staff are more professional.\"",

            "A bit off the beaten track but well worth it. Really excellent service. The food is great too. The brisket is super moist and good. My only criticism is that there was too much salt on the fries and in the burger. Recommended\"",
            "This restaurant is located right across from a parking lot which is a major plus when going out for the evening. The decor is very nice with a comfortable and relaxing feel to it, even though it's rather large in size. The menu is interesting enough however I found the prices to be rather high. I settled on the Chicken and biscuits which was underwhelming from both the look of it and the taste. My friends had the Fish Monger platter which they somewhat enjoyed. As this is an upscale casual restaurant I really liked the atmosphere and great service, for that reason, I would go back again but try another dish instead of what I had. This restaurant is a mild \\\"HIT\\\" for me but next visit I hope will provide better tasting food.\"",
            "If you like large open spaces with soaring ceilings this restaurant in the downtown core fits the bill.

There's a private second floor room that can easily seat up to twenty.\"",
            "This place was amazing. Nice open space, lots of tables...we started with the KFC and peppers. Both amazing. For mains we all had brisket. Was Delish. We also had the fries with the lemon chipotle mayo, mouth watering just thinking about it. \\n\\nFor desert we tried the rocky road sundae and cigar. Again, very memorable. \\n\\nThe burgers looks amazing, will need to return soon! Great service also!\""

On our first visit we took the Fisherman's plate twice and it was sooo delicious. The Beer and Coconut Shrimps, were amazing, like the calamari and of course the fish, rice and vegetable. We drank beer and took the creme Caramel as dessert. The Service from the owner and the Team is so friendly, that you feel welcome from the first second.

            "We managed to get a reservation for 5:30 on a Saturday thinking we must be beating the rush. The place was half full when we arrived and quickly filled up just after. Many families enjoying special celebrations and all ages. They were also busy preparing packages of food for take out. Amazing what they were turning out from that kitchen.Well staffed and attentive with frequent checking from the owner. Hot bread was served and water was topped up regularly. Cajun mussels are a must try. Delicious sauce that contained a variety of thinly sliced vegetables. Nice way to savour more of the sauce as you scoop up these veggies. Blackened chicken breasts with green peppercorn sauce , tender crisp vegetables and roasted potatoes were served piping hot and ample portions. Equally enjoyed was the special that night of lamb chops. Everything was beautifully plated and it was fun to watch other dishes come out with many unique bowls, plates and platters. We were also offered a complimentary liqueur after dinner. It has been awhile since we have come here and we won\\u2019t wait as long for our next visit.

Firstly there were no parking places anywhere near the restaurant. Secondly they were not checking anybody's covid vaccination certificates to eat in the restaurant. \\nOur table was not ready so we had to wait over half an hour to get seated, then a further half an hour to get water and menus. We ordered the coconut shrimp and the crab cakes as starters, these took another 30 minutes to arrive. The shrimp were good but the crab cakes were mushy and tasted funny. Our main courses took another 30 minutes to arrive. By this time it was after 10pm. Three of us ordered filet steak, one rare and the other two medium rare, well when they arrived the steaks were all well done. We complained to the owner but all he said was \\\"sorry\\\", pretty bad for a supposed steak house. Dozens of other steak houses in Toronto are much better. They have a new tent out front so they can seat more diners, but with only three wait staff they are really falling short. We will never be returning to this restaurant.\"",

In my experience I would say, \\\"That's New Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse!\\\"  \\nIn my 76 years, I've had the opportunity to travel through more than a few of the countries in the world, while sampling a wide variety of cuisines, and NEVER  have I had better food in a more welcoming, friendly environment.  \\nTables are covered with two red and white cloths and adorned with a fresh rose.\\nNew Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse is the hidden gem of Etobicoke. \\nYou must go for the best dining experience ever, served in a classy, comfortable dining room and  attended to by not one, but many pleasant, well trained staff.  \\nThe owner, Mike, is a special treat all in himself.  He does not miss a table and bestows upon each one an individual attention that seems almost impossible for one man to accomplish in a many-tabled room.  \\nWhen Mike stops at your table, he leaves you with the feeling that you are the only one he has ever had the pleasure to feed.  \\nHis brown eyes have a mischievous twinkle above a ready smile that is inviting and genuinely warm.  His conversation is comfortable and friendly and sneaky.  In our one-on-one time with him he learned I was visiting Ontario from Calgary and my girlfriend and I were celebrating our June birthdays.  Mine had been the 24th and Joanne's was that day.  \\nHave I mentioned the food?  \\nThe FIVE STAR, amazing food!  Beautifully presented and spiced with a deft and knowing hand in true cajun tradition.  My girlfriend had the salmon and I had the lamb chops!  Portions were more than generous and neither of us were able to clean our plates which meant another delicious meal was to be had from our leftovers.\\nI want to say how tender and flavourful the lamb chops were; only the fresh, seared al dente vegetables seriously threatened to show them up.\\nOf course we shared so I got to taste the melt-in-your-mouth, perfectly grilled, salmon that gave me a jolt of pure Pelican envy, wishing for a beak that could hold more than my belly can!   \\nBeing much too full to think of ordering dessert we basked in the last of our wines chosen from a broad cellar selection and chatted.  Even though it was still early in the evening and the dining room was full, we felt no pressure to get up and leave.\\nMike arrived again at our table and said they would like to give us complimentary birthday desserts and to please take our choice from the menu.  \\nSurprised, we both chose the creme caramel which was served on a large dinner plate with a big HAPPY BIRTHDAY written in chocolate and with a lit candle!  Even though we were bursting at the seams we both managed to find room to scrape the last bite of eggy caramel goodness, with a touch of semi-sweet chocolate bark, making it a piece de resistance.\\nNow drowning in our decadent fullness we were served with one more surprise in a small, fluted aperitif.  \\nAt first taste we thought Sambuca, but the taste was too smooth so we asked one of the waiters and found it was a delightful mix of frangelico and white creme de menthe.  Mmmmmm.\\nAnd there you have it!  \\nThe cat is out of the bag! \\nNew Orleans Seafood & Steakhouse is the place to go for your best dining experience ever!\"",
            "Dining perfection, is what you will get. Our party had sea bass, fisherman's platter and two, shared the jambalaya. All dishes were perfectly cooked and seasoned to perfection. Nice wine selections. As another reviewer said, Mike and his staff make you feel as though you're in his home having a wonderful meal. Attentive yet not too much -- the perfect service approach. This is one gem of a place. Treat yourself !!\"",

            "Having moved away from the GTA several years ago we have always missed our favourite restaurant and the beautiful meals and service we would have when dining at New Orleans Seafood and Steak.   So when our kids surprised us with dinner for 6 this past weekend we were delighted!   Even after travelling for almost 2 hours, all of our meals were excellent and exactly as we remembered them.  Jambalaya, Shrimp Creole, Fisherman\\u2019s Plate, Gumbo ya ya, calamari, coconut shrimp and Caesar salads.  What a feast!!  Even homemade beignets! \\nDon\\u2019t hesitate to order takeout until you can have the full experience of dining there when COVID restrictions are lifted. You won\\u2019t be disappointed!\"",
            "If you have not tried New Orleans Seafood and Steakhouse yet\\u2026 you truly are missing out!\\nAbsolutely hands down one of the best meals I\\u2019ve ate in my life!  From the time we sat down to the time we left, you were treating like family!  The owner and the servers always made sure you were taken care of and never without! The husband and wife who own this gem are amazing and I must say the wife is an amazing chef!!! \\nEvery bite left you wanting more!\"",
            "A friend took us here as she had previously enjoyed a meal here. We ordered the calamari appetizer, very tasty. Our table had jambalaya for 2, seafood pasta and the tenderloin steak. The food was phenomenal! I am not the biggest fan of spicy food ( prefer flavour to heat) my pasta sauce was modified with a little cream added to the creole sauce. It was the best seafood pasta I\\u2019ve ever had. The shrimp was tender and tasty, the fish too was very flakey and tender.  My son loved his steak and the jambalaya was  impressive in both flavour and size. Beignets and pecan pie rounded out the dining experience. Decor is very quaint with musical instruments on the walls and framed pictures. Restaurant was very busy with all the tables occupied. If I had to say where they could improve it would be in 2 things. 1)Another server\\u002Fbusser to fill our water glasses, take away plates and package up any leftovers for us to take home. We weren\\u2019t able to finish the jambalaya and it was taken away, we assumed it would be packaged up for us to enjoy tomorrow, but it wasn\\u2019t. What a waste. 2)Invest in a nespresso or keurig. Only option for coffee was expresso or latte. The option of having a nice decaf coffee or tea with dessert would have made the impossibly long wait for our bill a bit more tolerable. The wrap up of the evening was less than impressive.\"",
            "We go there a few nights each year for birthdays and anniversaries.  The fish and beef are always excellent.  The appetizers are great - particularly coconut shrimp and crabcakes. The service is friendly and attentive.  For example, we went with a group of 8 recently and ordered appetizers to share.  Instead of just bring the apps to the table, they made up 8 individuals plates of appetizers and made sure that everyone got a little bit of everything. And the presentation was impressive.  And at the end of the meal, the owner always comes by the table with a little shooter of schnapps to cleanse your palate.\\n\\nHighly recommended - but make a reservation.  The place is small and it always fills up.\"",
            "Had dinner last night at New Orleans Seafood and Steakhouse.  The atmosphere, food, drinks and service were all outstanding.  We had a larger party (7 people), but all meals were served hot and fresh.  We will definitely be going back.  And the after dinner drink was the cherry on top.  Thank you so much for making my special day so much more special.\"",

            "Although we live on Etobicoke, this was our first time at New Orleans Seafood and Steakhouse. The calamari and coconut shrimp appetizers were delicious and presented beautifully. Our shrimp creole and blackened grouper entr\\u00E9es were to die for. Owner Mike was attentive to our every need and service was impeccable in every regard. We would definitely recommend this restaurant and will be back!  A truly wonderful find.\"",
            "Lovely cozy dining room.  Delicious crab cakes, coconut shrimp, seafood jambalaya.  Great service .  However, the steak was a bit tough & the potatoes had an unbelievably spicy seasoning that was very uncomfortable to eat.  Good wine options!\"",
            "For anyone who remembers Sammy's Seafood Creole on Lakeshore Blvd when it was known for amazing ambiance and distinguished food you need to go here. It's ten times better, and Mike the manager and host is extremely friendly and knows how to make people feel at home. My family and I have gone here on a few occasions and we continue to do so even though it's out of our way. Beer battered coconut shrimp, jambalaya, crab cakes are my favourites on the signature menu. Last time I was there I chose the steak of the day and the demiglace and vegetable accompliments were cooked to perfection. For anyone who wants the best of the best in Toronto this is not only a hidden gem, but a place to indulge and enjoy because of the incredible food and beyond exceptional guest service. I work at a 5 star Marriott hotel in Toronto\\n I send guests here on a regular basis, and always receive praise for the reference. Thank you New Orleans for never letting my reference fail. \"",

            "We have been looking for a restaurant in the GTA that serves New Orleans style of food. We found a little gem that everyone should try and you won't regret it. The restaurant is a family run business and Mike and his family are charming hosts, delightful! Starters included a tasty Caesar Salad, with crispy fresh romaine and freshly shaved Parmigiano Reggiano that was well balanced. The Cajun Calamari were made to perfection and very tender. The Coconut Beer Shrimp was nicely balanced and not too sweet. The Seafood Gumbo was a bit on the thin side but had good flavour. The mains were terrific, three of us had the delicious, melt in your mouth Chilean Sea Bass which was reasonably priced to boot! Our youngest likes steak and he had the blackened strip loin with green peppercorn sauce. The steak was tender and better than the steak he had at Hy's downtown earlier this year. To end the evening we had Beignet's, Bananas Foster, Pecan Pie and Cr\\u00E8me Caramel. Mike provided complimentary after dinner aperitifs which was a surprise and a nice touch. We will be back!\"",
            "New Orleans seafood and steakhouse is bar none a fantastic choice. Amazing table service. Beyond delicious food and fantastic staff! The setting is romantic and relaxed and as I mentioned, the food is fantastic. Flavours burst from the dishes offered and the aroma throughout the restaurant is to die for! Food portions are to be commended! The jambalaya for 2 was enough for 3-4 people and by far an amazing choice. Pricing is extremely reasonable for the quality and quantity of food!\"",
            "I have lived in this neighbourhood since I was a teenager.  I have to admit that because of its location, I overlooked this restaurant.  Last night, my husband and I decided to give it a try.  We were fortunate to get a reservation.  When we called at 4 p.m., they one cancellation for two at 8:15.  The restaurant is small - it seats about 50 people and when we arrived, it was packed.  I enjoyed one of the best lobster bisques I have ever eaten.  It was tasty and had just the right amount of zing.  My husband ordered a scallop appetizer which was also delicious.  We shared the Jambalaya for two - it was fantastic.  It was loaded with fish, shellfish and sausage and the portion was quite generous we could not finish it all.  Wines were reasonable priced. We will definitely be back.\"",
            "Great great restaurant and atmosphere gentlemen waiting on was very generous and helpful 5 STAR! Seafood was great quality.\"",
            "This family owned restaurant is one of the best in the city! If you are looking for seafood, it would be the very top! The type of place that could easily be missed because it doesn't look like much from the outside, but on the inside you have the warmth of the owner and his family, the soothing sounds of light blues and jazz, and some incredible food and environment that convinces you that you are no longer in Toronto.\"",
            "I have driven by this restaurant numerous times.  It is situated in a tiny strip mall in the Scarlett road and east drive area.  I am so glad I decided to check it out.  I first googled it and noticed it was fantastically rated.  We tried to go two times before but one time it was closed due to holiday and the other it was not open yet for dinner.  We finally went there yesterday.  What a treat.  So content.  I ordered the sea bass and my husband the striploin steak and we asked for a topping of shrimp to make it a surf and turf.  It is the best sea bass I have ever had.  Perfectly cooked, seasoned but not too salty.  My grilled veg were perfect and the rice was tasty.  The crab cakes are a must. What a gem of a restaurant.  Pricing is what is in line with a good steakhouse but not too overly priced.  Also the service is impeccable.  We were only 2 ppl and went at opening.  Due to the size of the restaurant, I could see you would need reservations.  Thank you.  We will be back!\""

Mixed drinks are also on offer but beer is king here. The place would certainly be a high end bistro though the alliteration was probably as important as the nature of the venue. I tried the 1.5 pounds of mussels steamed in a beer broth with an artisanal bun, the latter ideal for sopping up the puttanesca style [tomatoes, garlic, olives and anchovies]. The recommended Achel Bruin, a dark, Belgian Trappist ale, was a nice beer. Service was very friendly and attentive: I had three bowls for the mussel shells, the first two whisked away in a timely manner when full. Most entrees are in the $18 to $25 range, reasonable by Toronto standards. I can seeing visiting again after a baseball matinee or before an evening basketball game.\"",

They were really good; mounds of mussels served with a hunk of bread. Couldn't finish despite my best efforts so I asked to take them home. No can do, he said. Health and Safety regulations prevented him from doing so. I was incredulous, disbelief reigning. But, he insisted and I gave in although I couldn't let go of those mussels. The solution, order another beer, an excellent Greenwood, wait an hour and try again.

            "I had the 5 spice pork belly banh mi with sweet potato fries.  The fries were spot on, which is hard to achieve with sweet potatoes.  Crisp outside with sweet moist inside.  Nice.  The pork belly was tender and succulent with nice accents from a grated carrot quick pickle ( I'm guessing here) and some greens.   Baquette nothing to get excited about, but overall a very tasty experience.\"",
            "Perfect for a quick bite! If you're looking for a smaller bite, the bao or tacos are great while the bahn mi are substantial. Good sized sides too. Everything's made fresh to order so expect to wait a litttle during busy times. Best priced lunch you'll find\"",
            "When France colonized they learned how to make authentic Baguette. This place is like Sub Way in Vi\\u00EAt Nam but better. Many choices abound. We had pulled pork,their version of Poutine, Korean Style. The offerings were fresh and made to order. Try it you'll live it and it is a real bargain. \"",
            "I really feel sorry for a lot of the other places that compete with Banh mi Boys as it's the best place.\\n\\nBBQ Chicken sandwich is incredible. Sweet fries are great as are the Kimchi fries if you are really hungry!\\n\\nGreat place, good value and staff always polite.\"",
            "I am extremely happy to have my husband convince me to eat here.   I was so hangery and wanted food right away.  I had the Steamed Bao: FRIED CHICKEN & PORK BELLY WITH FRIED.  What flavor and the chicken was so crispy without being overly oiled.  I would for so recommend.  My husband had the Pork Bahamas MI sandwich and the Kimichi Fries, the bread was fresh and the pork tender.  Fries were perfectly crispy and held up to the Kimichi without making them soggy.  Great change from normal French fries.  You must check it out..\"",
            "Visited the Banh Mi Boys for the first time and was not disappointed. I had the five spice pork belly on a baguette with Kimchi fries and my wife had the pulled pork steamed Bao.\\nThe pork belly was very tender and so tasty. Fresh carrot, pickled radish and cilantro topped it off. I ordered it mild with Sriracha sauce and it was perfect. Fries with Kimchi sounds a little wild but it is an awesome combination. They also add some pulled pork in the box. The Kimchi is not too spicy and the mix of flavors is fantastic. My wife's Bao was the perfect size for her at lunchtime and just as good. Portion sizes are good. We would recommend everyone to try the Banh Mi Boys.\"",
            "Went for takeout just before it shut on a Saturday night. Did not regret it -- banh mi was one of the best sandwiches I've ever eaten. Delicious bread, fresh, crunchy vegetables, and fragrant chicken. The fried chicken bao was also perfect. \\n\\nWould recommend to literally anyone. My only complaint was that 'hot' as a spice option was not as hot as I would have liked, but I eat chilli in every meal.\"",
            "This is a good place to have lunch. The kimchi fries are good as well as the grilled pork banh mi. The pork is nicely cooked and infused with lemongrass. Balanced out with the marinated carrots and daikon in the banh mi.\"",
            "Great food, the crispy chicken steam bun is epic, as is the confit duck bahn mi.   \\nI only get takeout,  I don\\u2019t think anyone should witness how much of this amazing food I can eat - don\\u2019t worry, I wash it down with a Diet Coke.  \\nEverything here is so good, service is fast, food is very well priced.  \"",
            "I love this kind of food and can't find much of it where I live, in either upscale or as quick-eats. I went here for a quick meal and was wowed. Fantastic. My tofu banh mi was excellent and I will be craving the side papaya salad for months to come. The food is cheap and flavorful, and the staff are friendly. If I lived nearby I'd be here for lunch several times a week!\"",
            "Do you ever wonder if you're missing something in your life, but can't quite put your finger on what? We had just that feeling all week, then we realized what was missing. We have never reviewed Banh Mi Boys - crazy! Well, better late than never.\\n\\nWe've been going to Banh Mi Boys since they opened their Queen St. W. location in 2011. We fell in love with their fusion style Banh Mi right from the get-go. Rather than cater only to the traditionalists, the Boys decided from the get-go to focus on hot meats from various cultures - including Korea, Japan and China - to stuff their gloriously crispy baguettes. We rocked the signature Five Spice Pork Belly, as well as the Kalbi Beef. As always the meats were delicious, and balanced perfectly with crispy carrots, crunchy jalapenos and super fresh, flavourful cilantro. Totally on point as usual.\\n\\nOh, and they also do non-banh mi items like bao and Korean tacos (killer). On this trip we shared a Five Spice Pork Belly Bao (because, pork belly!) as an \\\"appetizer\\\" - sooo good!\\n\\nIf you've never gotten around to trying Banh Mi Boys now is as good a time as any to try. Banh Mi are a great street food, and hold up well for take-away back to wherever you intend to plant yourself to devour their delicious offerings. You won't be sorry that you did.\"",

            "Grabbed a quick lunch while at work downtown here and it was awesome! I ordered quickly via the screen in the little restaurant and within a few minutes a huge banh mi sandwich came out. I got the 5 spice pork belly and it was a lot of great, lean, flavorful pork on a nice fluffy roll with a great sauce and some veggies. Plus it was quite cheap!\"",
            "AMAZING Vietnamese Sandwiches!!!\\n\\nThis stop was pre-planned for our trip to Toronto based on the awesome reviews and I wanted to have different cuisines while in town.  When we arrived in Toronto, this was our first stop for a quick bite. but I was lucky that the parking we found was walking distance to the GEM!. \\n\\nIt's a boutique restaurant franchise with limited seating and people tend to order, sit and eat if there's available seats and then leave. We were lucky to get seats as it was a busy Friday afternoon. \\n\\nI could tell my sisters were skeptical about the cuisine based on their facial expressions cause they never had this before. We ended up ordering a 5 spice pork belly, grilled chicken sandwiches, a grilled chicken Taco and fried chicken Bao. Everything was delicious from there reaction.\\nThey were really impressed by taste and crunchiness of pickled toppings paired with the sauce. The pickled carrots and cucumbers really enhanced the flavor in these sandwiches.  All I heard after that was \\\"hmmmmm this is good\\\"\\n\\nPrices are reasonable. We left feeling stuffed and extremely satisfied!\"",
            "Food was good - they have decent vegetarians options - the panko tofu is good, sweet potato fries were nice. The other baos are tasty, service is quick. Good spot to pick up a quick lunch\"",
            "Tried a couple of banh mi sandwiches, a couple of steamed bao's and a taco.  Different fillings in all.   Took out.  Good flavors!  The korean short rib beef was a bit tough, but was OK.   Rest were very good.  Squid was the best followed by braised beef and then the pork belly & pulled pork.  Good value for money.\\n\\nOnly detractor was the relatively long lineup in a small space.  Of course, cannot fault a restaurant for a long lineup :)   I wouldn't necessarily eat at the restaurant as it would be pretty crowded.\"",
            "The place is unassuming, that's for sure.  Think Eddie Huang's place in NYC and you get the idea.  Rap music playing, order from the sign, pay up and wait to be called.  The food is really really good.   I can highly recommend the tofu bao - seriously, one was enough for me. We split papaya salad and sweet potato fries. Two people total bill $19.00.  Tell me where you can eat like that for that price in Toronto. \"",
            "Found this gem right around the corner from our hotel (The Saint James). My wife had a chicken banh mi and I had the pork. We both went with medium heat but could have gone for more. Regardless, they were bursting with flavour like we've only ever experienced in Southeast Asia. Delicious! We also split an order of kimchi fries and loved the combination. Great find!\"",
            "My first time eating these Vietnamese mini-subs, was at Banh Mi Boys and the sandwich is just absolutely delicious, from top to bottom. It is a popular meal for me after I get tattooed, as it is in a good, centralised location and despite there being long lines many times, it is worth the wait. \\n\\nAmong the pickled vegetable mix and sauces that are compulsory on each banh mi, you can choose from squid, to pork, to chicken and beef; all are great and delicious. On the side, you can get Kimchi Fries, regular Fries or Sweet Potato Fries; all are delicious as well. If you're not in the mood for a banh mi, then go for a steamed bao or a taco, as both are great as well (especially if you don't want a ton of carbs from the bread).\\n\\nA gem, an absolute gem.\"",
            "This restaurant is fantastic. Perfect for a quick meal that isn't junk-y, unhealthy, and nauseating after. The choices are fantastic - highly recommend any of the steamed baos, tacos...actually everything. ITS DELICIOUS!\"",
            "They have a great choice of different Banh Mi's here. I had the lemongrass & tofu one first. Then had the pork belly one. Absolutely great. Super cheap as well and will leave you full\"",
            "A staple whenever I come to Toronto. The best viet subs and everything on the menu is delicious. Highly recommend the steamed bao if you want something less bready. Kimchi fries are the bomb! \"",
            "I usually just get a few baos and a kimchi poutine. The food never disappoints. The baos are great and the fries always fill me up because they give you a healthy portion. It does get extremely busy at lunch so I suggest using an app or something to pre-order. Great spot for lunch or dinner.\"",
            "Bang Mi Boys was a nice find. We went there for a quick lunch after walking around Queen Street W. and I was pleasantly surprised. The food was freshly made and the flavour of the foods worked well together. I tried the fried chicken bun and the pork belly bun and both were delicious. Each bun costs about $4.00 so it was cheap and good! The buns and the bread were fresh which is essential for a good sandwich. \"",
            "I came here on a Thursday afternoon before going to see a movie at the TiFF Bell Lightbox. I parked on Camden Street, which I read online had 3h free parking, but turned out it was not free, so I paid about $7 for parking (as the movie would take some time too). I arrived before the lunch rush, so I was able to order quickly and within 5 minutes, I was able to get my order. I ordered a 5 spice pork belly Banh Mi, 5 spice pork belly Steamed bao and Kimchi fries. The 5 spice pork belly banh mi, which I ordered medium spicy, was good! The pickled carrots, mayo and braised pork belly were a great combination! The steamed bao was also good, but not as good as the banh mi. The baguette of the banh mi is better suitable to the braised pork belly than the steamed bao. The fries were also good, but probably my least favorite of the bunch. The pulled pork and mayo helped add flavor to the fries. My favorite would have to be the banh mi, then the steamed bao, and lastly the kimchi fries. It was a good price too at about $16. Although good, there\\u2019s better, more authentic banh mi shops in the GTA, such as Banh Mi Saigon in Mississauga whose banh mi thap cam (aka banh mi dac biet) is still my favorite banh mi ever. I would still highly recommend visiting Banh Mi Boyz if you want to try banh mi & are in Toronto! \\n\"",

Mixed drinks are also on offer but beer is king here. The place would certainly be a high end bistro though the alliteration was probably as important as the nature of the venue. I tried the 1.5 pounds of mussels steamed in a beer broth with an artisanal bun, the latter ideal for sopping up the puttanesca style [tomatoes, garlic, olives and anchovies]. The recommended Achel Bruin, a dark, Belgian Trappist ale, was a nice beer. Service was very friendly and attentive: I had three bowls for the mussel shells, the first two whisked away in a timely manner when full. Most entrees are in the $18 to $25 range, reasonable by Toronto standards. I can seeing visiting again after a baseball matinee or before an evening basketball game.\"",

I believe the fries are double cooked, making them soft on the inside and crispy on the outside.

The poutine (chips with gravy and cheese) comes in 3 sizes,snack, meal and wow, but we all thought the snack size was plenty for one.  You can also have lots of different toppings which would be great to try, I tried the pulled pork.\\nThis is a takeaway type place with some tables inside and the  service was polite and efficient.

So we were impressed by the choice and the taste of our poutines. The only negative point is that they should mix the cheese and fries. The fries were all at the bottom. Otherwise it was a good experience! By the way the meal-size portion is enough for one person. And it is enough to clog your arteries (see picture)!\"",

This was a poor offering. The curds were passable but seemed impervious to melting. The sauce was thin and lacked flavor. The most disappointing aspect were the nearly uncooked fries.

Three sizes are offered; snack, meal and wow. It was very difficult, but I finally settled on a snake-sized traditional and a meal-sized cheese steak. The fries are hot, crisp and nicely seasoned, the cheese curds are fresh and \\\"squeaky\\\" and the sizes are generous for the price. Both the traditional and the cheese steak poutines were excellent.\\nI highly recommend this place and can't wait to return to Canada to try some other specialty varieties.\"",

Seems like it would be the perfect hangover food with the french fry base, the creamy gravy and the chewy cheese curds.  Generous portions and fast service (even for a fast-food place), with way more variations than I would have expected.  Who knew you could make a whole restaurant chain around a local delicacy?!?

            "I went to this BeaverTails shop with my girlfriend on Sun 20, Jan (2019). The shop was closed due to \\\"Adverse weather conditions\\\". Fair enough... the weather was very cold, snowy and in general not good for business. The whole city of Toronto was open for business, but I can understand that there won't be much people on the piers.\\nWe went back a couple of days later, just to notice that this time the opening timetable stated that they were open only Friday-Sunday, starting from 12PM. There was someone inside though, which opened the door informing us that they were closed due to the winter period not being very favourable for business unless it's the weekend. Fair enough, maybe we didn't notice the opening timetable the first time and the objection makes sense.\\n\\nI therefore decided to go back on Friday (before leaving Canada), around the opening time as I didn't have much time before leaving the country. I got there at around 12:15 and the shop was open as expected. I got in and asked for the BeaverTails of course and some green tea. They didn't have green tea. I asked if I could sit upstairs and they said I couldn't so I had to sit opposite the till, on high (and quite uncomfortable) stools. A man walked in a few minutes later and asked for a Poutine and they didn't have it. I asked if they had WiFi and they didn't (only place I visited that didn't offer WiFi).\\n\\nI understand being open only on certain days during the winter period. I understand less being closed due to bad weather when the rest of the city is open for business as usual. What I totally don't understand is being out of stock for some of the stuff you sell on your FIRST opening day at almost exactly the opening time and not that much people. They had Monday to Thursday to sort out supply and none of those days the weather was bad. They were clearly at the shop on Tuesday, I wonder doing what if not waiting for suppliers to come. How could they not have the ingredients for the products they sell? That's unforgivable to me.\\n\\nBeaverTails are nice, but you can find the recipe and make them yourself. You go to the shop to treat yourself and chill... something they clearly didn't want to offer.\\n\\nIf you end up right in front of the shop because you're walking there and you want to try BeaverTails, give it a go: BeaverTails are very nice. On the other hand, if you want to try what's two of the few \\\"traditionally\\\" canadian dishes, then forget it: you're better off searching for the recipes and prepare them yourselves.
